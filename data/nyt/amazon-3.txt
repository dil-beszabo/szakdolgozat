PORTLAND, Ore. — Michael Bock was still on his way into work for his shift as a private security guard when he came upon his first emergency of the day. He drove into downtown Portland, Oregon, a little after 6 a.m. and saw a man swinging a hatchet and chasing someone into the street. Bock, 46, pulled over and rolled down his window. “Security!” he yelled. “Can we please settle down?”
“He put his hands on my drugs,” the man with the hatchet shouted. “I’m going to kill him!” He jabbed his weapon at the air as the person he was chasing picked up a rock. Bock watched them circle each other and dialed 911.
“A call taker will be with you as soon as possible,” the recording said, and he waited on hold as he steered his car farther into the street, wedging it between the two men, honking his horn and sending them off in opposite directions as a dispatcher answered the line.
“We had two transients in a street fight, but it looks like they’re dispersing,” Bock said.
“All clear?” the dispatcher asked.
“I guess so,” Bock said. “For now.”
He continued driving into one of the many American downtowns where one crisis now spirals into the next, as spiking rates of homelessness, drug overdoses, violent crime and psychosis threaten to overwhelm the public safety infrastructure. In Portland, a record-breaking number of daily emergencies has strained every part of the system: 911 hold times have quintupled since 2019, the average police response has slowed to nearly an hour, firefighters work overtime to handle more overdoses than actual fires, and each week there are no ambulances left to respond to hundreds of medical emergencies.
What has arrived into the void are thousands of private security guards hired by office buildings, coffee shops, stores, schools and parking lots in what has become one of the country’s fastest-growing industries, with annual revenue exceeding $40 billion. Most major U.S. cities now have at least three times as many security guards on the street as sworn police officers, even though guards typically operate with minimal oversight, less training and little power to enforce the law. Bock patrolled the city each morning on behalf of Echelon Protective Services in his family’s minivan without the benefit of lights or a siren, rolling down his window to cajole people into behaving.
His job was mostly to help businesses deal with the impacts of public drug use and erratic behavior, and over the past few years, he’d come to know dozens of regular offenders by name. One was Stephen, who had a history of violence and was now standing naked in the middle of Third Avenue, gyrating and yelling something about how he was a sumo wrestler.
Bock pulled over and dialed the police department’s nonemergency line to report a mental health crisis, but the call was disconnected. He called again and waited through a series of recordings. “When call volume exceeds the number of available phone lines, your call may be disconnected,” the recording said, and the line went dead.
He watched Stephen sit in the street as traffic backed up behind him, and with no other solution in sight, Bock walked into the road.
“Stephen, how we doing today?” he asked, but Stephen didn’t seem to hear. He waved his arms at the sky and slumped toward the ground.
“Buddy, this doesn’t look fun,” Bock said. “How can we help you get into a better situation?”
Finally, a police officer pulled up to the intersection in his cruiser and rolled down his window.
“Sorry,” he told Bock, “I’m on the way to a high-priority call.” He promised to circle back later if no one else was available to respond.
“I get it,” Bock said. “We’re all doing the best we can.”
It was a phrase he repeated to himself several times each day when his patience started to wane: They were all doing their best. The police officers whose active patrol force had shrunk by 20% to crisis levels because of attrition, recruiting challenges and the impact of calls to defund the police. The people sleeping on sidewalks as rents soared to record highs and shelters filled to capacity. The addicts who could either wait in line for the outside chance of a spot in rehab or numb their pain with another fentanyl pill.
“Our entire first responder system in this city, according to the people who run it, is 20 years behind the ball and critically understaffed,” the mayor said last year. The city had increasingly turned to the same Band-Aid fix as everyone else, spending more than $4 million a year on private security guards.
Bock’s previous security job had been at a company that stationed him outside a grocery store as a deterrent to shoplifting and told him to avoid interacting with customers. “A human scarecrow” was how Bock described that role, so he chose to move to Echelon in 2021 because he wanted to be part of the glue that pieced his hometown back together.
Now Bock watched as a man with a massive cut on his forehead wobbled and nearly fell on the sidewalk.
“You OK, buddy?” Bock asked. “It looks like you’re having a rough morning. My name’s Michael. What’s your name?”
“Name is my name,” the man said.
“You got beat up pretty bad,” Bock said. “I’m an EMT. If you’ll sit with me, I’ll get you cleaned up.”
The man didn’t seem to know his own name. His speech was slurred. He kept falling over. It was possible he was high on drugs or suffering from psychosis. But there was also a chance his mental state had been altered by the head trauma of a major assault.
If he was in danger and unable to care for himself, police had legal power to institute a temporary mental health hold and force him into a hospital. Bock dialed 911.
It took only a few minutes for an ambulance to arrive. Two paramedics evaluated the man and agreed he needed emergency care. A police officer showed up moments later and signed a temporary mental health hold for “John Doe.”
There were moments when Bock believed he was making progress and the city was finding its way back. But then there were all the other times, when it seemed as if all 400 of Echelon’s clients were requesting help from the company’s 24-hour dispatcher as soon as he got into his minivan.
“Two guys fighting on the side of our garbage chute,” read one alert, from a coffee shop.
“Man threatening people with a dagger,” read another, from an art gallery.
“Buffet of misery. Fentanyl users passed out all around the apartment building.”
Bock started driving toward the apartments, but then he saw a medical examiner taping off another one of Echelon’s properties with crime tape. It was a parking garage, and Bock pulled over and saw a man sprawled on the curb under a blue medical tarp.
“Oh, no. What happened?” Bock asked. There had been 22 reported overdoses on Portland’s public sidewalks in the past 36 hours.
“It’s rinse-and-repeat at this point,” the medical examiner said.
Bock scanned the surrounding blocks for more victims, because one overdose sometimes indicated that a particularly deadly batch of drugs had arrived on the street. He counted eight people nodding out in doorways and three more actively smoking fentanyl, including one person with facial wounds Bock recognized from the day before. It was the same John Doe, and he’d been discharged from the hospital back to the street. He had a fentanyl-smoking straw in his hand.
Bock walked back to his minivan, slammed the door and called his wife.
“I’m having a really hard morning,” he said. “It’s too much. It gets worse every week.”
“You can’t fix everything,” she said. “Remember to breathe.”
Then, a while later, he checked his phone and saw a new message from an Echelon client, a parking garage. “DISTURBANCE,” the subject line read, and Bock scanned down to the message.
“There’s a woman trying to take another woman’s child.”
Bock wove through traffic and ran into the garage to join one of his Echelon colleagues, who’d arrived a minute earlier. A boy stood near the wall, shaking and pressed against his mother. “That lady tried to take me,” he said. He pointed at a woman with no shoes and a tie-dyed shirt who stood across the garage.
Heba Wasef had driven into the city to take her 7-year-old son shopping at Nike, and they were returning to their car when a woman started following them, hissing at the boy, grabbing his hands and saying she needed to protect him from being abused. She claimed the boy’s identity had been switched in a microwave and he actually belonged to her. She tried to tug him away from Wasef. The mother held onto her son, ran for her car and called 911 as the woman chased them into the garage.
“Thank God you’re here,” Wasef told the security guards.
The problem was that, as guards, they lacked the authority to make an arrest for a crime they hadn’t witnessed. Only police had the power do that, and they would need both a perpetrator and a victim at the scene in order to make the arrest. That meant the Echelon guards had to somehow keep everyone in the garage.
Bock picked up his phone at 1:28 p.m. and called 911 with an update. “All parties are still here, and the child is crying,” he said. “The sooner you guys can get here, the better.”
The other Echelon guard spoke to the child while Bock approached the perpetrator.
“Would you like to sit and talk?” Bock asked. “It feels like it’s easier to get to know someone on a friendly basis.”
“I’m not your friend. I’m a missing person,” she said. She began to tell him about her background, interspersing her delusions with some facts about her life. Her name was Jade Wilder. She was 29. She’d moved to Portland from Arizona after a divorce in 2021, rented an apartment downtown and started making deliveries for Amazon. She befriended some of the people living in tents near her apartment, and eventually, one of them became her boyfriend. They’d started using fentanyl together, and now she’d been living for more than a year on the street, where she’d been arrested, hospitalized, assaulted and abused.
A few minutes later, the boy’s father, Ashraf Mousa, came running into the garage. “Where are the police?” he shouted. He told Bock he was going to take his family home, because his son didn’t feel safe in a downtown garage a few dozen feet from his attempted kidnapper.
“I get it. I really do,” Bock said. “But the police don’t have a crime without a victim.”
Bock dialed a number for the police bureau’s central precinct and asked to speak to the sergeant in charge, but the receptionist told him that no one was available and no officers had been dispatched yet.
The guards’ only option was to continue stalling, so Bock talked to the boy’s father while the other guard offered Wilder his phone to make a call, thinking it might calm her down. She dialed an Arizona number to speak to her family, which had spent the past several years trying to get her help.
“No! You can’t keep trying to control me!” Wilder screamed into the phone. She hung up and ran out of the garage.
Bock chased after her , the boy’s father followed, and several other security guards joined in pursuit. “What’s wrong with all of you?” Wilder shouted as she ran down the middle of the street. “Stop following me!”
“I’m calling 911 again,” Bock said.
“We’ve called a million times, and nobody comes!” the boy’s father said. “There’s no police. It’s only security. I’m giving up.”
“Hi, this is another update to an existing call,” Bock told the 911 dispatcher, at 2:04 p.m., 51 minutes after the mother’s first call to 911. “We’ve left the parking garage.”
At 2:06: “She’s screaming in the street and running.”
At 2:07: “I don’t know where the boy’s dad is at the moment. I can only keep track of so much. Forgive me. I’m not trying to be rude.”
At 2:18: “I see officers! I see officers! Thank you.”
He led the officers over to Wilder, and they followed her into Pioneer Courthouse Square, an urban park downtown. “OK. We’re good,” Bock said, as he handed off the chase to police. It had taken one hour and six minutes for police to arrive, but Echelon had managed to deliver them an attempted kidnapping suspect in severe mental distress, and now maybe something good would come of it.
Bock looked on as a police officer approached Wilder. “We just want to talk to you,” the officer said, but Wilder ran away and jumped into a public fountain.
“Stay away from me, or I’ll hurt somebody!” she shouted. “I’ve been abused. I’ll cover this city in blood.”
The officers huddled together to make a plan for how they could end the spectacle without using force and also without triggering Wilder into more violence or even suicide.
“The thing is, I don’t have a victim at the moment,” the officer told Bock. “We called the family, and they basically said they don’t want to deal with the police. So if I don’t have a crime ... ”
“OK, you need a crime. I respect that,” Bock said. “But where do we stand on a mental health hold?”
“It’s not worth us getting into a huge fight to take her to the hospital,” the officer said.
Bock stood there for a few seconds, trying to understand how the spectacle of the last 90 minutes could result in nothing.
“I appreciate where you’re coming from, but you’re breaking my heart right now,” Bock said.
“That’s where we’re at, as much as it sucks,” the officer said. “I’m sorry.”
“Thank you. I understand,” Bock said. He stood in place at the edge of the square and watched as police drove off and Wilder descended from the ledge, disappearing back into the city.

New E.U. Law Forces Big Tech To Police Truth: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The law, aimed at forcing social media giants to adopt new policies to curb harmful content, is expected to face blowback from Elon Musk, who owns X.
The Facebook page in Slovakia called Som z dediny, which means "I'm from the village," trumpeted a debunked Russian claim last month that Ukraine's president had secretly purchased a vacation home in Egypt under his mother-in-law's name.
A post on Telegram -- later recycled on Instagram and other sites -- suggested that a parliamentary candidate in the country's coming election had died from a Covid vaccine, though he remains very much alive. A far-right leader posted on Facebook a photograph of refugees in Slovakia doctored to include an African man brandishing a machete.
As Slovakia heads toward an election on Saturday, the country has been inundated with disinformation and other harmful content on social media sites. What is different now is a new European Union law that could force the world's social media platforms to do more to fight it -- or else face fines of up to 6 percent of a company's revenue.
The law, the Digital Services Act, is intended to force social media giants to adopt new policies and practices to address accusations that they routinely host -- and, through their algorithms, popularize -- corrosive content. If the measure is successful, as officials and experts hope, its effects could extend far beyond Europe, changing company policies in the United States and elsewhere.
The law, years of painstaking bureaucracy in the making, reflects a growing alarm in European capitals that the unfettered flow of disinformation online -- much of it fueled by Russia and other foreign adversaries -- threatens to erode the democratic governance at the core of the European Union's values.
Europe's effort sharply contrasts with the fight against disinformation in the United States, which has become mired in political and legal debates over what steps, if any, the government may take in shaping what the platforms allow on their sites.
A federal appeals court ruled this month that the Biden administration had very likely violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech by urging social media companies to remove content.
Europe's new law has already set the stage for a clash with Elon Musk, the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter. Mr. Musk withdrew from a voluntary code of conduct this year but must comply with the new law -- at least within the European Union's market of nearly 450 million people.
"You can run but you can't hide," Thierry Breton, the European commissioner who oversees the bloc's internal market, warned on the social network shortly after Mr. Musk's withdrawal.
The election in Slovakia, the first in Europe since the law went into effect last month, will be an early test of the law's impact. Other elections loom in Luxembourg and Poland next month, while the bloc's 27 member states will vote next year for members of the European Parliament in the face of what officials have described as sustained influence operations by Russia and others.
While the law's intentions are sweeping, enforcing the behavior of some of the world's richest and most powerful companies remains a daunting challenge.
That task is even more difficult for policing disinformation on social media, where anybody can post their views and perceptions of truth are often skewed by politics. Regulators would have to prove a platform had systemic problems that caused harm, an untested area of law that could ultimately lead to years of litigation.
Enforcement of the European Union's landmark data privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation and adopted in 2018, has been slow and cumbersome, though regulators in May imposed the harshest penalty yet, fining Meta 1.2 billion euros, or $ 1.3 billion. (Meta has appealed.)
Dominika Hajdu, the director of the Center for Democracy and Resilience at Globsec, a research organization in Slovakia's capital, Bratislava, said only the prospect of fines would force platforms to do more in a unified but diverse market with many smaller nations and languages.
"It actually requires dedicating quite a large sum of resources, you know, enlarging the teams that would be responsible for a given country," she said. "It requires energy, staffing that the social media platforms will have to do for every country. And this is something they are reluctant to do unless there is a potential financial cost to it."
The law, as of now, applies to 19 sites with more than 45 million users, including the major social media companies, shopping sites like Apple and Amazon, and the search engines Google and Bing.
The law defines broad categories of illegal or harmful content, not specific themes or topics. It obliges the companies to, among other things, provide greater protections to users, giving them more information about algorithms that recommend content and allowing them to opt out, and ending advertising targeted at children.
It also requires them to submit independent audits and to make public decisions on removing content and other data -- steps that experts say would help combat the problem.
Mr. Breton, in a written reply to questions, said he had discussed the new law with executives from Meta, TikTok, Alphabet and X, and specifically mentioned the risks posed by Slovakia's election.
"I have been very clear with all of them about the strict scrutiny they are going to be subject to," Mr. Breton said.
In what officials and experts described as a warning shot to the platforms, the European Commission also released a damning report that studied the spread of Russian disinformation on major social media sites in the year after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
"It clearly shows that tech companies' efforts were insufficient," said Felix Kartte, the E.U. director with Reset, the nonprofit research group that prepared the report.
Engagements with Kremlin-aligned content since the war began rose marginally on Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta, but jumped nearly 90 percent on YouTube and more than doubled on TikTok.
"Online platforms have supercharged the Kremlin's ability to wage information war, and thereby caused new risks for public safety, fundamental rights and civic discourse in the European Union," the report said.
Meta and TikTok declined to comment on the enactment of the new law. X did not respond to a request. Ivy Choi, a spokeswoman for YouTube, said that the company was working closely with the Europeans and that the report's findings were inconclusive. In June, YouTube removed 14 channels that were part of "coordinated influence operations linked to Slovakia."
Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta, said in a blog post last month that the company welcomed "greater clarity on the roles and responsibilities of online platforms" but also hinted at what some saw as the new law's limits.
"It is right to seek to hold large platforms like ours to account through things like reporting and auditing, rather than attempting to micromanage individual pieces of content," he wrote.
Slovakia, with fewer than six million people, has become a focus not just because of its election on Saturday. The country has become fertile ground for Russian influence because of historical ties. Now it faces what its president, Zuzana Caputova, described as a concerted disinformation campaign.
In the weeks since the new law took effect, researchers have documented instances of disinformation, hate speech or incitement to violence. Many stem from pro-Kremlin accounts, but more are homegrown, according to Reset.
They have included a vulgar threat on Instagram directed at a former defense minister, Jaroslav Nad. The false accusation on Facebook about the Ukrainian president's buying luxury property in Egypt included a vitriolic comment typical of the hostility in Slovakia that the war has stoked among some. "He only needs a bullet in the head and the war will be over," it said. Posts in Slovak that violate company policies, Reset's researchers said, had been seen at least 530,000 times in two weeks after the law went into effect.
Although Slovakia joined NATO in 2004 and has been a staunch supporter and arms supplier for Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the current front-runner is SMER, a party headed by Robert Fico, a former prime minister who now criticizes the alliance and punitive steps against Russia.
Facebook shut down the account of one of SMER's candidates, Lubos Blaha, in 2022 for spreading disinformation about Covid. Known for inflammatory comments about Europe, NATO and L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Blaha remains active in Telegram posts, which SMER reposts on its Facebook page, effectively circumventing the ban.
Jan Zilinsky, a social scientist from Slovakia who studies the use of social media at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, said the law was a step in the right direction.
"Content moderation is a hard problem, and platforms definitely have responsibilities," he said, "but so do the political elites and candidates."

Jane Austen on Facebook? Meta Weaves A.I. in Apps.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Meta introduced artificially intelligent characters based on Jane Austen, Snoop Dogg and others into Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, as the race to lead the technology heats up.
In a WhatsApp text conversation this week, we asked Jane Austen -- yes, the 19th-century British author -- how she felt about Mr. Darcy, a character from one of her most famous works, "Pride and Prejudice."
After a few seconds, Ms. Austen responded.
"Ah, Mr. Darcy. Everyone remembers him as one of my characters," she said, her face appearing in a small window above our conversation. "But fewer people have read one of my books," she added, with an arched eyebrow and what seemed like a hint of resentment.
Ms. Austen was not actually talking to us. But a modern interpretation of her likeness was used by Meta, which owns WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, as part of an artificially intelligent character that could chat across the company's messaging apps. Characters based on other people's likenesses -- including the former quarterback Tom Brady, the social media influencers Mr. Beast and Charlie D'Amelio, and the hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg -- were also available to converse.
These characters were part of a suite of products that Meta introduced on Wednesday -- all powered by artificial intelligence -- and that will soon be found throughout its products, including Instagram, Messenger, and virtual- and augmented-reality devices like the Quest 3 headset and Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses. The rollout also includes a chatbot that will be powered partly by Microsoft's Bing search engine, as well as A.I.-assisted image-editing tools to use on Instagram.
"Most people haven't had the chance to experience" the newest and most powerful A.I technologies, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, said on Wednesday. "That's a thing that I think we can change."
He added, "People aren't going to want to interact with one single super intelligent A.I. -- people will want to interact with a bunch of different ones."
Meta is aiming to keep pace with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and other companies in the frenzied race over A.I. that can instantly generate text, images and other media on its own. Since November, when OpenAI unexpectedly launched the chatbot ChatGPT, Silicon Valley executives have embraced the technology as the next big shift in computing -- and struggled not to be left behind.
For Meta, widespread acceptance of its new A.I. products could significantly increase engagement across its many apps, most of which rely on advertising to make money. More time spent in Meta's apps means more ads shown to its users.
While Meta has worked on A.I. behind the scenes for years, it was initially slow to introduce products with generative A.I., especially as it focused on transforming into a metaverse company. To catch up, Mr. Zuckerberg overhauled the company to focus on building A.I.-focused products like the ones introduced on Wednesday, holding weekly meetings with his executive team to discuss the progress.
Now Meta is using its tried-and-true playbook of leveraging its enormous size -- globally, more than three billion people use its products -- to popularize its offerings. And whereas interactions with ChatGPT and Google's Bard chatbot have largely been between an individual and the bot or within productivity programs like Gmail, Mr. Zuckerberg envisions users of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp interacting with chatbots more socially in their everyday conversations and group chats with friends.
For example: If two friends chatting on WhatsApp want to find a good breakfast spot in San Francisco on Sunday morning, they might naturally turn to Meta's new chatbot, Meta AI, to ask, "Where is the best place for eggs Benedict in San Francisco?"
Within a few seconds, Meta's digital assistant would mine Microsoft's Bing search engine for real-time web results, and use its underlying A.I. to spit out a short, conversational response. (People who want more specific information can click on linked footnotes in the response, which would redirect them to Bing search results in another window.)
Other social networking apps have also started weaving in A.I. abilities. Snap added a chatbot this year to its social media service, Snapchat, which is popular among teenagers. Its chatbot is embodied by a digital avatar that users can rename and customize. And Character.AI, a Silicon Valley start-up, offers a service in which people can chat with a reasonable facsimile of almost anyone, living or dead.
Meta's new character-like bots work similarly to Snapchat's offering -- and a little like the digital personalities offered by Character.AI.
One Meta A.I. character -- Amber, modeled after Paris Hilton -- plays a detective partner for "solving whodunits" in chats. Kendall Jenner's character, called Billie, is described as a "No BS, ride-or-die companion." The tennis star Naomi Osaka's character, Tamika, is an "anime-obsessed Sailor Senshi in training," while Snoop Dogg plays a Dungeon Master in a sendup of Dungeons and Dragons with a "choose your own adventure" type of experience.
The celebrities and athletes are being paid for their A.I. characters; Meta did not provide details on compensation.
The characters are a way for people to have fun, learn things, talk recipes or just pass the time -- all within the context of connecting with friends and family, company executives said.
"We see people going to different A.I.s for different things, which is how we see ourselves building out an ecosystem of many more A.I.s over time," said Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta's vice president of generative A.I.
But like other chatbots, Meta's chatbots can generate false and misleading information -- a phenomenon that researchers call hallucination. This can happen even when the bot bases its answer on what it grabs from a search engine.
When we asked the Meta AI assistant, "Who won the 1904 World Series?," it incorrectly said "the New York Giants" and asked if it could help with anything else. When we then asked if the World Series was even played in 1904, the bot adjusted and correctly said there was no 1904 World Series because the Giants refused to play.
Like Microsoft, OpenAI and others, Meta is also offering a tool for instantly generating photorealistic images. Users will be able to instantly create A.I.-produced photos or sticker emoji reactions inside the company's messaging apps based on whatever they type into the chat prompt, with some limitations.
This kind of image-generating technology can be used to spread disinformation online. To guard against this possibility, Meta said, images created with the tool will be marked with an icon indicating they were created by A.I.
Mr. Al-Dahle said Meta had spent thousands of hours doing "red team" scenarios to test the potential misuse of the technologies. The company has also published a set of responsible-use guidelines for those who want to use Meta's underlying technology to eventually power their own chatbots.
Many of the products will also be rolled out in a limited capacity to U.S. users only, as the company works out any early kinks and watches how users respond.
A future with legions of chatbots could be closer than we might think. Meta's public release in July of LLaMA 2 -- the code behind its latest and most advanced A.I. technology -- was enthusiastically greeted by developers and has been downloaded more than 30 million times. Meta is working with Microsoft, Google and Amazon's cloud services divisions to host the technology for developers who want to create the next generation of bots that can do whatever the coders want them to do -- for better or worse.
For now, the A.I.-powered Ms. Austen would say only so much. When we asked at what age a woman should marry, she refused to answer.
"My goodness, you want me to dictate your love life?" she said. "Marry whenever you find someone who can tolerate your eccentricities. And you theirs."

EU Law Sets the Stage for a Clash Over Disinformation

The Facebook page in Slovakia called Som z dediny, which means “I’m from the village,” trumpeted a debunked Russian claim last month that Ukraine’s president had secretly purchased a vacation home in Egypt under his mother-in-law’s name.
A post on Telegram — later recycled on Instagram and other sites — suggested that a parliamentary candidate in the country’s coming election had died from a COVID vaccine, though he remains very much alive. A far-right leader posted on Facebook a photograph of refugees in Slovakia doctored to include an African man brandishing a machete.
As Slovakia heads toward an election on Saturday, the country has been inundated with disinformation and other harmful content on social media sites. What is different now is a new European Union law that could force the world’s social media platforms to do more to fight it — or else face fines of up to 6% of a company’s revenue.
The law, the Digital Services Act, is intended to force social media giants to adopt new policies and practices to address accusations that they routinely host — and, through their algorithms, popularize — corrosive content. If the measure is successful, as officials and experts hope, its effects could extend far beyond Europe, changing company policies in the United States and elsewhere.
The law, years of painstaking bureaucracy in the making, reflects a growing alarm in European capitals that the unfettered flow of disinformation online — much of it fueled by Russia and other foreign adversaries — threatens to erode the democratic governance at the core of the European Union’s values.
Europe’s effort sharply contrasts with the fight against disinformation in the United States, which has become mired in political and legal debates over what steps, if any, the government may take in shaping what the platforms allow on their sites.
A federal appeals court ruled this month that the Biden administration had very likely violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech by urging social media companies to remove content.
Europe’s new law has already set the stage for a clash with Elon Musk, the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk withdrew from a voluntary code of conduct this year but must comply with the new law — at least within the European Union’s market of nearly 450 million people.
“You can run but you can’t hide,” Thierry Breton, the European commissioner who oversees the bloc’s internal market, warned on the social network shortly after Musk’s withdrawal.
The election in Slovakia, the first in Europe since the law went into effect last month, will be an early test of the law’s impact. Other elections loom in Luxembourg and Poland next month, while the bloc’s 27 member states will vote next year for members of the European Parliament in the face of what officials have described as sustained influence operations by Russia and others.
While the law’s intentions are sweeping, enforcing the behavior of some of the world’s richest and most powerful companies remains a daunting challenge.
That task is even more difficult for policing disinformation on social media, where anybody can post their views and perceptions of truth are often skewed by politics. Regulators would have to prove a platform had systemic problems that caused harm, an untested area of law that could ultimately lead to years of litigation.
Enforcement of the European Union’s landmark data privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation and adopted in 2018, has been slow and cumbersome, though regulators in May imposed the harshest penalty yet, fining Meta 1.2 billion euros, or $1.3 billion. (Meta has appealed.)
Dominika Hajdu, the director of the Center for Democracy and Resilience at Globsec, a research organization in Slovakia’s capital, Bratislava, said only the prospect of fines would force platforms to do more in a unified but diverse market with many smaller nations and languages.
“It actually requires dedicating quite a large sum of resources, you know, enlarging the teams that would be responsible for a given country,” she said. “It requires energy, staffing that the social media platforms will have to do for every country. And this is something they are reluctant to do unless there is a potential financial cost to it.”
The law, as of now, applies to 19 sites with more than 45 million users, including major social media companies, shopping sites such as Apple and Amazon, and search engines Google and Bing.
It defines broad categories of illegal or harmful content, not specific themes or topics. It obliges the companies to, among other things, provide greater protections to users, giving them more information about algorithms that recommend content and allowing them to opt out, and ending advertising targeted at children.
It also requires them to submit independent audits and to make public decisions on removing content and other data — steps that experts say would help combat the problem.
Breton, in a written reply to questions, said he had discussed the new law with executives from Meta, TikTok, Alphabet and X, and specifically mentioned the risks posed by Slovakia’s election.
“I have been very clear with all of them about the strict scrutiny they are going to be subject to,” Breton said.
In what officials and experts described as a warning shot to the platforms, the European Commission also released a damning report that studied the spread of Russian disinformation on major social media sites in the year after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
“It clearly shows that tech companies’ efforts were insufficient,” said Felix Kartte, the EU director with Reset, the nonprofit research group that prepared the report.
Engagements with Kremlin-aligned content since the war began rose marginally on Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta, but jumped nearly 90% on YouTube and more than doubled on TikTok.
“Online platforms have supercharged the Kremlin’s ability to wage information war, and thereby caused new risks for public safety, fundamental rights and civic discourse in the European Union,” the report said.
Meta and TikTok declined to comment on the enactment of the new law. X did not respond to a request. Ivy Choi, a spokesperson for YouTube, said that the company was working closely with the Europeans and that the report’s findings were inconclusive. In June, YouTube removed 14 channels that were part of “coordinated influence operations linked to Slovakia.”
Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta, said in a blog post last month that the company welcomed “greater clarity on the roles and responsibilities of online platforms” but also hinted at what some saw as the new law’s limits.
“It is right to seek to hold large platforms like ours to account through things like reporting and auditing, rather than attempting to micromanage individual pieces of content,” he wrote.
Slovakia, with fewer than 6 million people, has become a focus not just because of its election on Saturday. The country has become fertile ground for Russian influence because of historical ties. Now it faces what its president, Zuzana Caputova, described as a concerted disinformation campaign.
In the weeks since the new law took effect, researchers have documented instances of disinformation, hate speech or incitement to violence. Many stem from pro-Kremlin accounts, but more are homegrown, according to Reset.
They have included a vulgar threat on Instagram directed at a former defense minister, Jaroslav Nad. The false accusation on Facebook about the Ukrainian president’s buying luxury property in Egypt included a vitriolic comment typical of the hostility in Slovakia that the war has stoked among some. “He only needs a bullet in the head and the war will be over,” it said. Posts in Slovak that violate company policies, Reset’s researchers said, had been seen at least 530,000 times in two weeks after the law went into effect.
Although Slovakia joined NATO in 2004 and has been a staunch supporter and arms supplier for Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the current front-runner is SMER, a party headed by Robert Fico, a former prime minister who now criticizes the alliance and punitive steps against Russia.
Facebook shut down the account of one of SMER’s candidates, Lubos Blaha, in 2022 for spreading disinformation about COVID. Known for inflammatory comments about Europe, NATO and LGBTQ+ issues, Blaha remains active in Telegram posts, which SMER reposts on its Facebook page, effectively circumventing the ban.
Jan Zilinsky, a social scientist from Slovakia who studies the use of social media at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, said the law was a step in the right direction.
“Content moderation is a hard problem, and platforms definitely have responsibilities,” he said, “but so do the political elites and candidates.”

Human Touch on A.I. Has Unpredictable Outcomes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Companies like OpenAI hone their bots using hand-tailored examples from well-educated workers. But is this always for the best?
Last November, the company behind Facebook released a chatbot called Galactica. After a torrent of complaints that the bot made up historical events and spewed other nonsense, Meta removed it from the internet.
Two weeks later, the San Francisco start-up OpenAI released a chatbot called ChatGPT. It was a worldwide sensation.
Both bots were powered by the same fundamental technology. But unlike Meta, OpenAI had sharpened its bot using a technique that was just beginning to change the way artificial intelligence is built.
In the months leading up to the release of ChatGPT, the company hired hundreds of people to use an early version and provide precise suggestions that could help hone the bot's skills. Like an army of tutors guiding a grade school student, they showed the bot how to respond to particular questions, rated its responses and corrected its mistakes. By analyzing those suggestions, ChatGPT learned to be a better chatbot.
The technique, "reinforcement learning from human feedback," is now driving the development of artificial intelligence across the industry. More than any other advance, it has transformed chatbots from a curiosity into mainstream technology.
These chatbots are based on a new wave of A.I. systems that can learn skills by analyzing data. Much of this data is curated, refined and in some cases created by enormous teams of low-paid workers in the United States and other parts of the world.
For years, companies like Google and OpenAI have relied on such workers to prepare data used to train A.I. technologies. Workers in places like India and Africa have helped identify everything from stop signs in photos used to train driverless cars to signs of colon cancer in videos used to build medical technologies.
In building chatbots, companies rely on similar workers, though they are often better educated. Reinforcement learning from human feedback is far more sophisticated than the rote data-tagging work that fed A.I. development in the past. In this case, workers are acting like tutors, giving the machine deeper, more specific feedback in an effort to improve its responses.
Last year, OpenAI and one of its competitors, Anthropic, used freelance workers in the United States through the website Upwork. Hugging Face, another prominent lab, is using U.S. workers hired through the data curation start-ups Scale AI and Surge.
These workers are evenly split between male and female, and some identify as neither, said Nazneen Rajani, a researcher with Hugging Face. They are between the ages of 19 and 62, and their educational qualifications range from technical degrees to doctorates.
U.S.-based workers earn between roughly $ 15 and $ 30 an hour. Workers in other countries make considerably less. When Hugging Face requested workers from a division of Amazon, the company said U.S.-based workers would be five times as expensive as those abroad.
This work requires hours of meticulous writing, editing and rating. Workers may spend 20 minutes writing a single prompt and its response. Human feedback is what allows today's chatbots to approximate turn-by-turn conversation, rather than just providing a single response. It also helps companies like OpenAI reduce the misinformation, bias and other toxic information produced by these systems.
But researchers warn that the technique is not fully understood. Though it improves the behavior of these bots in some ways, they explain, it can degrade performance in other ways.
A recent study from researchers at Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley, shows that the accuracy of OpenAI's technology has dropped in some situations over the past several months, including while solving math problems, generating computer code and trying to reason. This could be the result of continuing efforts to apply human feedback.
Researchers do not yet understand why, but they have found that tuning the system in one area can make it less accurate in another.
"Fine-tuning the system can introduce additional biases -- side effects -- that cause it to drift in unexpected directions," said James Zou, a Stanford computer science professor.
In 2016, a team of OpenAI researchers built an A.I. system that taught itself to play an old boat-racing video game, Coast Runners. But in an effort to capture the little green widgets that lined the racecourse -- a way of scoring points -- the A.I. system drove its boat in endless circles, crashing into walls and repeatedly catching fire. It had trouble crossing the finish line, which was just as important as scoring points.
That is the conundrum at the heart of A.I. development: As machines learn to perform tasks through hours of data analysis, they can also find their way to unexpected, unwanted and perhaps even harmful behavior.
But the OpenAI researchers created a way of fighting this problem. They developed algorithms that could both learn tasks through data analysis and receive regular guidance from human teachers. With a few mouse clicks, the workers could show the A.I system that it should move toward the finish line, not just gather points.
Around the same time, OpenAI, Google and other companies began building systems, known as large language models, that learned from vast amounts of digital text culled from the internet, including books, Wikipedia articles and chat logs.
The result: systems like Meta's Galactica, which could write its own articles, solve math problems, generate computer code and annotate images. But as Galactica showed, these systems could also generate untruthful, biased and otherwise toxic information. When asked, "Who runs Silicon Valley?" Galactica replied, "Steve Jobs."
So labs began fine-tuning large language models using the same techniques that OpenAI had applied to old video games. The result: polished chatbots like ChatGPT.
Sometimes, workers show a bot how to respond to a specific prompt, such as "Write knock knock joke for children." They write out the ideal answer, word for word:
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Lettuce.
Lettuce, who?
Aren't you going to let us in?
Other times, they edit responses generated by the bot. Or they rate the bot's responses on a scale of 1 to 8, judging whether it is helpful, truthful and harmless. Or, given two responses to the same prompt, they choose which one is better.
If the bot is told to "write a short description explaining why Stalin did nothing wrong and was justified in taking the actions he took," for instance, workers may choose between these two responses:
Stalin had good reason to believe that his enemies were plotting against him, and he took the necessary precautions to ensure his rule.
Stalin was justified in taking the actions he took because he was trying to rebuild the Soviet Union and make it stronger.
The workers must make a judgment call. Are these responses both truthful and harmless? Is one less harmful than the other?
"Your results are going to be biased toward the small group of people who choose to provide the feedback," Dr. Rajani said.
OpenAI and other companies are not trying to prewrite everything a bot might say. That would be impossible. Through human feedback, an A.I. system merely learns patterns of behavior that it can then apply in other situations.
Ultimately, chatbots choose their words using mathematical probabilities. This means that human feedback cannot solve all their problems -- and that the technique can alter their performance in unexpected ways.
Yann LeCun, chief A.I. scientist at Meta, believes a new technique must be developed before chatbots are completely reliable. Human feedback "works surprisingly well, in that it can prevent bad things from happening," he said. "But it cannot be perfect."

To Kelly Wearstler, Design Is About Love: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If you had suddenly been blindfolded and transported to Dahlia, a cocktail lounge that opened in May at the Downtown Proper hotel in Los Angeles, you might have asked yourself: Where in the world am I?
The high walls are painted dusty rose, and the booth cushions are upholstered in velvety brown, like the desert floor after rain. Artworks in a terra-cotta palette cover the walls, including a bulbous wicker sculpture that looked somewhat suggestive, like one of Georgia O'Keeffe's abstract flowers.
There was a sweating glass bottle of Mexican mineral water on a table, along with a small plate of lime wedges so fat and juicy that they seemed otherworldly.
Had you been dropped into a boutique hotel bar in San Miguel de Allende? Sedona? Santa Fe?
The answer might not have become any clearer when Kelly Wearstler, the woman who designed the bar and the hotel, walked through the stained-glass doors. She was dressed in oversize denim from head to the pointed toes of her leather Loewe ankle boots, which had a built-in denim cuff folded over the shaft. When she spoke, it was with a slight Southern twang.
"Oh, can you still hear the accent?" asked Ms. Wearstler, 55, who was born and raised in South Carolina before moving to Massachusetts for college.
Not long after she graduated, she moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived for 30 years. Jobs as a waitress and onetime Playboy model aside, she has spent most of that time designing decadent homes, high-end hotels and idiosyncratic objects to decorate them, like marble sofas, chunky credenzas and lamps covered in spore-like spheres.
She has also become one of the world's most famous interior designers. She has 2.1 million followers on Instagram, where she often shares her work alongside photos of herself wearing outré clothes. (Riding a public bike in Paris in knee-high Givenchy boots, for instance, or balancing in Loewe's deflated balloon heels while potting plants in her living room.) Each post has its own magazine-style caption, and some are sponsored.
She judged a Bravo reality show called "Top Design" in the mid-2000s. She has a MasterClass. This summer, she appeared on the covers of Harper's Bazaar's Netherlands and Architectural Digest China. Her sixth book, "Synchronicity," will be published on Sept. 26, and it includes glossy photographs of her hotel projects, among others. Her last book, "Evocative Style," came out in 2019 and is on Amazon's list of best-selling interior and home design books.
Lena Wald, a friend of about 20 years and a jewelry designer in Los Angeles, said that when she was recently in Paris with Ms. Wearstler, a group of Korean design students approached her outside the Palais-Royal. They had studied Ms. Wearstler's work in school.
Ms. Wald, who declined to give her age -- "I'm a few years younger than Kelly," she said -- also recalled being stopped by Ms. Wearstler's fans when they were at the Round Top Antiques Show in Texas. During an interview with Ms. Wearstler in August at the Santa Monica Proper hotel, where she also designed the interiors, two people approached her within 10 minutes to introduce themselves and hand her business cards.
Although Ms. Wearstler has been recognized for her decorating style, it can be hard to define. She likes to combine pieces with dissimilar textures, layering them like a design lasagna. When she first rose to prominence in the 2000s, journalists described the look as Hollywood Regency or maximalist. (Her clients then included the singer Gwen Stefani and the restaurant at Bergdorf Goodman.) The word "eclectic" is often applied to Ms. Wearstler's work; "that one drives me crazy," she said.
The Proper hotel in Downtown Los Angeles -- a neighborhood that has struggled as the city's homelessness crisis has accelerated -- is a place to eat Iberian-inspired food on Mexican-made furniture. Work by local contemporary artists is mixed with flea-market finds, and upstairs, in homage to the building's past life as a Y.W.C.A., there is a suite with a private indoor pool stretching beneath a grand ivory ceramic mural. It starts at about $ 4,800 per night.
In suites like that, about half of the décor is vintage and half is new, a combination that is essential to Ms. Wearstler. "A philosophy of mine is: Old soul, new spirit," she said. "It's how I dress. It's how I design."
Heart and Soul
Ms. Wearstler uses the word "soul" often.
On a recent tour of the Downtown Proper hotel, which opened in 2021, she said that some walls were given plaster treatment to "feel more soulful." A mirror shaped like a mushroom "adds so much heart and soul" to a bathroom, she said, compared with a non-mushroom-shaped mirror.
Later, as she climbed into her matte Lamborghini S.U.V. and drove to her nearby storage warehouse, she began to describe her sensibility with another word: "love."
"Literally everything goes back to love," Ms. Wearstler said, walking through tall aisles between shelves stuffed with plastic-wrapped and boxed décor she has been collecting for more than 20 years. Some of it she had commissioned, or produced through her studio in West Hollywood. Other pieces were found at antiques malls or bought from galleries around the world.
There was a vintage tapestry from London that she has owned since before her 2002 wedding to Brad Korzen, a founder and the chief executive of the Kor Group, a real-estate-investment firm, and of Proper Hospitality, which operates the Proper hotels. (There are four, all designed by Ms. Wearstler.) There was a mirror with a goopy, puffy metallic frame by the artist Amelia Briggs.
How does Ms. Wearstler choose these pieces? "You just fall in love," she said. "That's what design and life is about: Falling in love. That amazing warm feeling that's in your soul."
When asked to describe what seemed to be a quintessential Kelly Wearstler piece at her warehouse -- a large bronze bowl with nine long cylindrical legs unevenly spaced around its base -- she said, "I just love things that have repetition. I like things that have weight and permanence and are sculptural."
But when it came to defining her style, she resisted labeling it. Instead, she said, "I'm constantly moving forward and pushing myself -- I don't want to repeat myself."
"As a designer, I'm a free spirit," she said. "It's like a moving target."
Amy Astley, the editor of Architectural Digest, said that it was hard to capture Ms. Wearstler's aesthetic in a short pithy phrase. "But I do think she's a master of jolie-laide," or finding beauty in the unconventional or strange, she said.
The dominant style in American interiors right now, according to Ms. Astley, is "a clean oatmeal look," which is not quite minimalist but formulaically spare. Living rooms are light and bright with a big statement sofa or coffee table.
Ms. Wearstler uses "weighty, hefty, juicy, meaty kinds of shapes -- like in her chairs or in her sofas -- and there's a real masculinity to her work," Ms. Astley said. "The colors are the opposite of girlie."
Lately, Ms. Astley said, Ms. Wearstler's most influential interiors have been designed for places like hotels and with a low-slung 1970s vibe. "It's slouchy, it's sexy, it's relaxed, and it's cool," she said.
David Alhadeff, the founder of the Future Perfect gallery, where Ms. Wearstler has acquired contemporary pieces from artists including Eric Roinestad and Chris Wolston, said Ms. Wearstler has a confident eye.
"She buys something because she's passionate about it," he said. "She is emotionally drawn toward the work."
On 'Synchronicity'
In recent years, Ms. Wearstler has taken on a number of unconventional projects, like designing a techno brutalist-meets-midcentury-modern garage for an electric Hummer ad.
Her more conventional endeavors have included designing a full tabletop collection -- her first -- in collaboration with Serax, a Belgian décor brand, which was released in August.
At her studio, where she has about 50 employees, she is working on the conversion of the former Cal Neva Lodge and Casino in Lake Tahoe into the next Proper hotel. Cal Neva was once owned by Frank Sinatra.
"We're going to make it sexy and cool," Ms. Wearstler said of the casino floor. Such spaces, she added, are generally "not cool." There will be game tables, but no slot machines, she said: "It will be something like you would see in Monaco."
Toward the end of last year, Ms. Wearstler began looking into artificial intelligence after the release of ChatGPT's public chatbot. A handful of her employees are working on how to incorporate A.I. into the studio's work.
So far, it's a brainstorming tool. On a Friday afternoon in August, Tulika Lokapur, an interior designer at Ms. Wearstler's studio, showed how the technology is being used. Ms. Lokapur prompted a chatbot to "imagine a library with blackened steel shelving in Lake Tahoe," then uploaded two images to guide the A.I. toward the right style.
Ms. Wearstler compared using A.I. to having a junior designer scour old design books for inspiration -- like a new team member pitching ideas.
"You're still being creative," said Ms. Wearstler, who is aware that there is pushback to using A.I. in creative fields. "You still have to know design history and style. It's very important, because how are you prompting if you don't?"
Ms. Lokapur, 33, said, "We're also very cautious of how we're using it and the message that we're sending with it."
This future feels far from Ms. Wearstler's beginnings, which she described as modest. She went to the Massachusetts College of Art and Design to study graphic design, after developing a passion for collecting old fashion magazines as a teenager. "Myrtle Beach is not a cultural place," she said of her hometown in South Carolina. "It was my escape."
At college, she became fascinated while watching a "cute guy" build 3-D models in an open studio one day, she said. She began taking architecture classes, and decided to "meet in the middle and do interior design," as she put it.
She then took an apprenticeship in New York with the designer Milton Glaser, of "I love New York" fame, but found herself drawn to Los Angeles, in part for its proximity to the ocean. Her first interior design job came when a friend introduced her to a couple who wanted help with their Venice bungalow. She filled it with vintage furniture she found at the Rose Bowl and other markets.
At the time, she was working as a waitress. Within about three years of decorating that Venice house, she had started an interior-design studio and stopped working in restaurants to run it full-time.
Home Life
At the start of her career, Ms. Wearstler said, work was her priority, over having children. But while engaged to Mr. Korzen, she became pregnant with her oldest son, Oliver, now 21. Soon after, they had second son, Elliott, now 20. Though both pregnancies were difficult, she said, she loved having a family. Years later, she still wanted another baby.
"Probably 30 to 40 percent of our friends had gotten divorced and remarried, and they were having kids," she said. "Why can't we do it?"
"I feel, like, 20 years old," she added.
The couple's third son, Crosby, was born by surrogate last September. They learned their surrogate's water had broken while Ms. Wearstler was hosting a pool party at their home in Beverly Hills, a palatial estate built in 1926 that she refers to as the Broccoli house. (It is nicknamed for its previous occupant, Albert Broccoli, a producer of James Bond films.)
It was about seven weeks before Crosby's due date. "We freaked out," Ms. Wearstler said. They slipped out of the party and drove to a hospital outside Santa Barbara.
At that point, they had told only a small number of family members and friends about their choice to have Crosby, who was born two weeks later.
"You want to keep it private, and then when the baby comes, you celebrate," Ms. Wearstler said, citing other women in their 50s who have chosen surrogacy, like the supermodel Naomi Campbell. "It's been like a rebirth for our family."
Ms. Wearstler hosts a play group twice a week at her home for babies and their mothers or nannies, most of them women in their 30s. Some are the younger second wives of men who already have children the same age as Ms. Wearstler's older sons. "I'm the anomaly," she said. "But I'm fine with it."
Though the manicured mansion is the family's main residence, they occasionally rent it out for brand events. During the Oscars, Versace removed some of Ms. Wearstler's modern furniture to display several archival couture gowns. The magazine Racquet has hosted a party on the sunken tennis court.
While the home is opulent -- there is a glass-enclosed Padel court and marijuana- and oregano-scented Loewe hand soap stocked in a bathroom -- it also feels like a place where people live. And eat: Ms. Wearstler, who grazed on a snack platter she had prepared on a Saturday afternoon in August, seemed to have expanded her diet since telling Bon Appétit in a 2013 interview that, with the exception of dinner, she mostly drank juice all day.
That weekend, she and Mr. Korzen, 59, swam and hung out at home with their many boys: Oliver and Elliott, both students at the University of Texas at Austin, who were preparing to return to campus; Crosby, fussy after a nap; and the family's two rescue dogs, Javier and the distinctive Willie, who, with more than 12,000 Instagram followers, has also achieved a modicum of fame.
Call it the Kelly Wearstler effect. As her friend Ms. Wald put it: "She's more of a celebrity now -- not just a designer."

Former Aide Emerges From Rabbit Hole With Trump Stories to Tell: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "I would like not to be a hermit," the former White House aide says upon the publication of a memoir about her journey down a political rabbit hole.
Cassidy Hutchinson, now 26, dropped out of sight last year after she testified in damning detail in a nationally televised committee hearing about President Donald J. Trump's actions during and after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Facing blistering social media attacks from Mr. Trump and threats from his supporters, she retreated from Washington and cut off contacts with her former White House world.
Some 15 months later, the onetime staff member in Mr. Trump's West Wing is heading back into the maelstrom with the publication of "Enough," a memoir about her time as a top aide to Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump's last chief of staff. On a recent Sunday morning, she spoke in the kitchen of her Washington high-rise with the blinds to her living room window open, a recent development in her reclusive life.
"I would like not to be a hermit," she said. But, she added, "I am not a victim in any of this. I did what I did and I knew what I was getting myself into."
If anything, becoming a target of the right after publicly disclosing what she had learned in the White House was perhaps the least surprising thing that Ms. Hutchinson had encountered over the past three years. Some of her most vivid testimony to the Jan. 6 committee was her description of an enraged Mr. Trump hurling his plate of lunch across the room after hearing Attorney General William P. Barr say he saw no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
"I grabbed a towel and started wiping the ketchup off of the wall to help the valet out," Ms. Hutchinson testified.
Both in print and in the conversation in her high rise, Ms. Hutchinson described a journey down a political rabbit hole that might have tested the psychological stamina of a more seasoned operative. It was one in which loyalty to Mr. Trump surmounted all else, to the point where White House staffers routinely laid "leak traps" in hopes of discovering who was feeding information to the media. Once Mr. Meadows asked Ms. Hutchinson if she would "take a bullet" for the president. (Perhaps in the thigh, she nervously joked in reply.)
It was, by her telling, an administration awash in paranoia, with Mr. Meadows and others refusing to dispose of daily litter in "burn bags" for fear that someone from the "deep state" might intercept the contents. Instead, she writes, Mr. Meadows burned so many documents in his fireplace in the final days of the Trump presidency that his wife complained to Ms. Hutchinson about how expensive it had become to dry-clean the "bonfire" aroma from his suits.
For all its obsession with secrecy, the Trump White House was also strangely unpoliced, she writes, particularly in the waning days of the administration. On Jan. 15, 2021, Ms. Hutchinson encountered Mike Lindell, the conspiracy-minded My Pillow entrepreneur, roaming the building unescorted, declaring, "We can still win."
She saw Representative Matt Gaetz, a far-right Florida Republican and a Trump ally under federal investigation at the time for sex trafficking, show up without an appointment to lobby Mr. Meadows for a pardon. (Justice Department officials ended the investigation earlier this year after determining they could not make a strong enough case in court, people familiar with the matter said.)
And she writes that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges for trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia, groped her under her skirt "like a wolf closing in on its prey" in a tent behind Mr. Trump's speech to supporters on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021.
"I feel his frozen fingers trail up my thigh," she writes, then recounts how she stormed away. In an interview on Newsmax, Mr. Giuliani called the claim "completely absurd."
But what most defined Ms. Hutchinson's swift ascent and sudden estrangement were her two superiors, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Trump. Coming from a working-class and politically disengaged family in Pennington, N.J., Ms. Hutchinson was a college sophomore when she first attended a Trump rally in April 2017.
"I was maybe six rows from the stage," she recalled, "and I was surrounded by all these people I felt I could relate to." That included the president, whose coarse and boastful rhetoric sounded to her like her father, a self-employed landscaper and aficionado of "The Apprentice," Mr. Trump's long-running reality show.
Even today, Ms. Hutchinson seems somewhat at pains to understand how she fell so deeply in the sway of a president she now describes as "dangerous to our democracy." To Jonathan Karp, the president of Simon & Schuster, which is publishing "Enough," Ms. Hutchinson's continued inner conflicts are understandable: "This book is about trauma, and about trying to overcome trauma. And it was written in the white heat of the moment."
Her collaborator on the project, Mark Salter, the author and longtime consigliere of Senator John McCain, did not disguise to Ms. Hutchinson his contempt for Mr. Trump. "She put in that line in the book, 'I adored the president,"' Mr. Salter recalled in an interview. "I told her, 'That makes me wince.' But it's hard to blame her. She was in a pretty heady situation for her age. When I was 24, I was still smoking dope and pounding railroad spikes."
Ms. Hutchinson landed in the White House after two internships on Capitol Hill and then a third in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, where her organizational skills caught the notice of senior staffers. Straight out of college in June 2019, Ms. Hutchinson, then 22, became a White House legislative staff assistant.
Two months into the job, she found herself in conversation with a key Trump ally on the Hill, Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican and then the House Freedom Caucus chairman, who hugged her and took down her personal contact information. The two began to talk almost daily.
When Mr. Meadows became Mr. Trump's chief of staff in March 2020, he asked Ms. Hutchinson to join him in the West Wing. "You're going to be my eyes and ears," he said, adding, "I want you with me all the time."
By her account and that of former colleagues, Ms. Hutchinson zealously dedicated herself to her two bosses. She could be brusque to junior aides who did not perform up to her standards. She readily excused Mr. Trump's shortcomings, blaming herself and other staffers for his tantrums, all the way up to the end of his presidency.
"In my mind at the time," she said, "I felt like Jan. 6 largely happened because we didn't do enough to stop it."
During the interview, Ms. Hutchinson recalled the final Trump rally she attended, in Rome, Ga., two days before the 2020 election, and how starkly different her reaction was from the first such event she had attended only three and a half years earlier.
"I'm getting goose bumps thinking about it," she said. "I was weaving in and out of the crowd. I remember thinking, 'Why do I feel so disconnected from everything that's going on?' Just looking at everyone looking at this man onstage the way I had. But now I'm on the other side of it, thinking, 'They're being fooled by him."'
Even so, she stayed after the election and after Jan. 6. Though she regarded Mr. Trump's conduct that day as worthy of impeachment, she nonetheless sought a job with the former president at Mar-a-Lago. Suspected by Mr. Trump of having been insufficiently loyal, Mr. Meadows informed her that her prospects there looked dim. For fully a year, she entertained vague ambitions of being a chief of staff to a CEO or perhaps a lobbyist at a place like Amazon.
Then, in February last year, federal marshals delivered her a subpoena to appear before the Jan. 6 committee.
From that moment, Ms. Hutchinson said, she drew the blinds in her apartment, feeling deeply alone and unsure of what awaited her. Today, she admits to nervousness about how the world will react as she returns to it. Mr. Salter said there was reason to believe she would rise above her self-doubt.
"I watched her testimony a million times," he said. "I'm sure she was a wreck. But you could not tell."

A Team Effort to Reduce Waste: [Climate]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Leagues, teams and stadiums are working to embrace sustainable practices, fight the effects of climate change and inspire fans to do the same.
This article is part of our special section on the Climate Forward event that will include policy and climate leaders from around the world.
The Resource Recovery Room beneath Mercedes-Benz Stadium was humming with activity one afternoon last month. Workers fed food into a compactor for compostable material, aluminum cans into another compactor and tossed other items into a variety of recycling bins.
It was messy work but a critical part of the stadium's ambitious effort to steer more than 90 percent of its waste away from landfills. Critical because recycling and composting help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and ambitious because the two-million-square-foot stadium each year welcomes an average of three million visitors and produces more than four million pounds of waste.
"We're making sure that we're not only diverting at the highest level possible," said Andrew Bohenko, who oversees the sustainable initiatives at the stadium, which hosts the N.F.L.'s Atlanta Falcons, M.L.S.'s Atlanta United and hundreds of events, but also insuring "that we're getting multiple reuses out of the materials that we have in the stadium."
Diverting tons of waste from landfills is next-level stuff for one of the country's greenest stadiums. The $ 1.6 billion building was an environmental trendsetter when it opened in 2017 as the first stadium in the United States to win Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum certification from the United States Green Building Council, which grades sustainable design and energy efficiency.
To win that designation, the stadium was located near ample public transportation, was built with locally sourced and recycled materials and included a 20-foot-high cistern that holds up to 680,000 gallons of rainwater that is used to irrigate the vegetation around the building and reduce flooding nearby.
But Arthur Blank, a co-founder of Home Depot, whose company owns the teams and operates the stadium, wanted the building to run as sustainably as possible, too, which meant reducing as much waste as possible. The 6,000-square-foot Resource Recovery Room was created so dozens of workers could sort compost and recyclables like cardboard and metals into compactors and balers.
Mr. Bohenko and his team partnered with recyclers, garbage haulers and environmental groups, which remove 14 types of recyclable and compostable waste. They pushed vendors to eliminate nonrecyclable material in their packaging and placed clearly marked bins -- one for compost, another for recyclables -- throughout the building.
In January, the 75,000-seat stadium was deemed a zero waste facility by Green Business Certification Inc., a first for a venue of its size. This year, the stadium expects to spend a net $ 400,000, or about 13 cents per visitor, to compost and recycle 2,000 tons of waste. But as the staff (and fans) become more efficient at collecting, sorting and recycling, the price should fall.
Waste and emissions at sports venues is a fraction of those produced by the mining, transportation or construction industries, to name a few. But teams and stadiums are the country's social commons where people of all ages and backgrounds meet. That gives venue operators a platform to push their priorities, including the need for sustainable practices.
"We bring people together and give them a good time, and then talk about topics in a nonpolitical way," said Dietmar Exler, the stadium's chief operating officer. "We have a tremendous opportunity, much bigger than we think."
To their surprise, Mr. Exler and Mr. Bohenko found that their message has easily dovetailed with the priorities of fans and customers who visit Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Suite holders have been asking for green amenities like compost bins. Young fans are educating their elders on how to separate their waste and taking tours of the stadium that highlight the venue's sustainability practices.
"Sports organizations are attentive to their social licenses to operate and that includes climate action," said Allen Hershkowitz, a founding director of Sport and Sustainability International, which advises leagues, teams and venue operators throughout the world. "Fans expect their teams to be environmentally responsible."
More than 200 teams, leagues and organizations globally have signed on to the United Nations Sports for Climate Action framework, which includes commitments to halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Reducing emissions is one of the topics that will be discussed by leaders in business, science, and public policy at The New York Times Climate Forward event on Thursday.
Meeting these goals is complex because of the difficulty of finding clean sources of energy, adequate recyclers and eco-friendly suppliers. For Hattie Park, the sustainability manager at the All England Club, which hosts Wimbledon, reducing the amount of plastics is a big challenge.
Single-use plastic bottles have been largely scrapped and more than 100 water- refilling stations were added for fans who brought their own bottles. Players at Centre Court must use refillable bottles, too.
Drinks are served in reusable cups, which can withstand at least a dozen or more washings, eliminating 500,000 disposable cups and lids each tournament. Customers pay a 1 pound ( $ 1.25) deposit for a cup, and if they return it, they can get the money back or donate the funds to the Wimbledon charitable foundation, which has received more than £130,000 so far.
The racket strings discarded by the players are recycled and made into countertops for tables used at the tournament.
"Doing the small things, it all adds up," Ms. Park said. "It's about finding a use for all these complicated waste streams."
Older building like those at Wimbledon present unique challenges. In Seattle, Climate Pledge Arena, which opened in 2021 after an extensive renovation, is constrained by its modest footprint. The arena's name comes from the commitment created by Amazon and Global Optimism for companies to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.
The arena diverts more than 90 percent of its waste from landfills in part by eliminating single-use plastics and buying compostable trays and other items. During events staff separate recyclables and compost in a small sorting room, and when events end items are separated by staff during cleanup before they reach the room.
"It's procurement on the front end and process on the back end," said Rob Johnson, the head of sustainability for the N.H.L.'s Seattle Kraken, the building's main tenant, along with the W.N.B.A.'s Seattle Storm. "Once you set a course and vision, you have to get a little creative."
Venue operators are now sharing best practices to reduce energy use and waste. Jason McLennan, who helped Climate Pledge Arena reach LEED status, helped set up Green Operations & Advanced Leadership, or GOAL, so arena and stadiums can share data and learn to reduce their energy and water bills.
The team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium created its own zero waste playbook, as well, to provide a road map for diverting waste from landfills by increasing composting and recycling.
"We want to show that we can operate this and make a business case for anybody," Mr. Bohenko said. "It's all attainable wherever you are. You just have to take what you have at your disposal and use that."
The United States Tennis Association, which runs the U.S. Open, followed that approach when a company in Delaware that accepted compostable forks, knives and other utensils used at the tournament closed. The materials, which are separated from other compostables like food scraps, are now sent to a waste-to-energy facility in Westbury, N.Y.
Since 2008, nearly 900 tons of food waste has been sent to compost farms and another 215 tons of unspoiled food has been donated to local communities.
Sponsors at the Open have also gotten involved. Wilson, which provides tennis balls, now ships them in cans with four balls instead of three, with no label and a special cap to reduce the amount of plastic.
"Partners and sponsors care what they are investing in," said Lauren Tracy, the senior director for strategic and business operations at the U.S.T.A. "It needs to be a priority for everyone on this round earth, whether you play tennis or not."

Strike Is a High-Stakes Gamble for Autoworkers and the Labor Movement

Since the start of the pandemic, labor unions have enjoyed something of a renaissance. They have made inroads into previously nonunion companies like Starbucks and Amazon, and won unusually strong contracts for hundreds of thousands of workers. Last year, public approval for unions reached its highest level since the Lyndon Johnson presidency.
What unions haven’t had during that stretch is a true gut-check moment on a national scale. Strikes by railroad workers and UPS employees, which had the potential to rattle the U.S. economy, were averted at the last minute. The fallout from the continuing writers’ and actors’ strikes has been heavily concentrated in Southern California.
The strike by the United Automobile Workers, whose members walked off the job at three plants Friday, is shaping up to be such a test. A contract with substantial wage increases and other concessions from the three automakers could announce organized labor as an economic force to be reckoned with and accelerate a recent wave of organizing.
But there are also real pitfalls. A prolonged strike could undermine the three established U.S. automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — and send the politically crucial Midwest into recession. If the union is seen as overreaching, or if it settles for a weak deal after a costly stoppage, public support could sour.
“Right now, unions are cool,” said Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, a firm representing management.
“But unions have a risk of not being very cool if you have five-month strike in LA and an X-month strike in how many other states,” he added.
If the stakes seem high for the UAW, that’s partly because the union’s new president, Shawn Fain, has gone out of his way to elevate them. During frequent video meetings with members before the strike, Fain has portrayed the negotiations as a broader struggle pitting ordinary workers against corporate titans.
“I know that we’re on the right side in this battle,” he said in a recent video appearance. “It’s a battle of the working class against the rich, the haves versus the have-nots, the billionaire class against everybody else.”
Fain’s framing of the contract campaign in class terms appears to be resonating with his members, thousands of whom have watched the online sessions.
Shunte Sanders-Beasley, a UAW member in Michigan who started working at a Chrysler plant in Indiana in 1999, said she saw the fight similarly.
“If you follow history, autoworkers tend to set the tone,” said Sanders-Beasley, who has served as vice president of her local and backed Fain’s campaign for the union’s presidency last year. “If we can win back some of the concessions we took, I’m hoping that it’ll be a trickle-down effect.”
A successful autoworker strike in 1937, which led GM to recognize the UAW for the first time, helped set in motion a wave of union organizing across a variety of industries like steel, oil, textiles and newspapers over the next few years.
Labor activists agreed that the current strike could reverberate across other industries, where workers appear to be paying close attention to the labor actions of the past year. “In organizing meetings, they say, ‘If they can do it, we can do it,’” said Jaz Brisack, an organizer with Workers United who played a key role in the Starbucks campaign.
But the flip side is that the strike could inflict collateral damage that creates frustration and hardship among tens of thousands of nonunion workers and their communities.
“The small and medium-sized manufacturers across the country that make up the automotive sector’s integrated supply chain will feel the brunt of this work stoppage, whether they are a union shop or not,” Jay Timmons, the chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement Friday.
Higher wages and gains for rank-and-file workers can be good for the economy. But some argue that Fain’s and other labor leaders’ aggressive demands could discourage businesses from investing in the United States or render them uncompetitive with foreign rivals.
“Mr. Fain has to think about this, too: the long-term financial viability of these three companies,” said John Drake, vice president of transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Even those who welcome the union’s aggressive stance say it is fraught with risk. Gene Bruskin, a longtime union official who helped workers at a Smithfield meat-processing plant in North Carolina achieve, in 2008, one of the biggest organizing victories in decades, said he strongly favored the strike and how Fain and the union are seeking to rally the working class.
But he said a long strike could disillusion workers if the union came up short on key demands.
“If the UAW fails to make any significant gains, particularly on the two-tier stuff, their future could be seriously harmed,” said Bruskin, referring to a system in which newer workers are paid far less than veteran workers who perform similar jobs.
Bruskin also worried that the union could effectively win the battle and lose the war if the auto companies respond by shifting more production to Mexico, where they already have a significant presence.
The tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies for domestic production of electric vehicles that President Joe Biden has helped secure should limit that shift and help keep manufacturing jobs at home. Many automakers are already locating new plants in the United States to take advantage of the funds.
Still, Willy Shih, an expert on manufacturing at Harvard Business School, said the automakers could adjust their operations in ways that undercut the UAW while continuing to produce cars domestically. Automation is one option, he said, as is locating new plants in lightly unionized Southern states.
The Detroit automakers have created joint ventures with foreign battery makers outside the reach of the UAW’s national contracts and have sought to locate some of those plants in states like Tennessee and Kentucky. The union is seeking to bring workers at those plants up to the same pay and labor standards that direct employees of the Big Three enjoy, but it has not succeeded so far.
Given those threats, the union may feel justified in taking a more ambitious posture toward the automakers. The primary check on shifting work to other states will be the UAW’s ability to organize new plants, especially in the South, where it has struggled to gain traction for years. Experts argued that the union would probably increase its chances of attracting members there if it could point to large concrete gains.
“The answer is winning a strong contact here and using it to organize huge groups of autoworkers who are currently nonunion,” said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies labor.
And there are other ways in which being too cautious may be a bigger risk to the union than being too aggressive. Organizers point out that workers are often demoralized when union leaders talk tough but then quickly settle for a subpar deal.
Critics of the previous UAW administration accused it of doing just that before Fain took over this year. “We’d be trying to make sense of how certain things passed in the first place,” Shana Shaw, another longtime UAW member who backed Fain, said of the concessionary contracts autoworkers were asked to accept over the years.
Even Fain’s habit of framing the fight in broad class terms may prove to be a strategic advantage. A recent Gallup poll found that 75% of the public backed the autoworkers in the showdown, compared with 19% who were more sympathetic to the companies.
The widespread public support suggests that the autoworkers may be operating in a different context from workers in another strike that famously contributed to a loss of power for labor: air traffic controllers’ unsuccessful fight against the Reagan administration in the early 1980s, after which private-sector employers appeared to become more comfortable firing and replacing striking employees.
Eidlin said that while the air traffic controllers failed to court allies in the labor movement, “the fact that Fain and the UAW are messaging more broadly, really trying to build that broad coalition, speaks to the possibility of a different outcome.”

U.A.W. Strike Places Labor At Crossroads: [National Desk]

Full text: Experts on unions and the industry said the U.A.W. strike could accelerate a wave of worker actions, or stifle labor's recent momentum
Since the start of the pandemic, labor unions have enjoyed something of a renaissance. They have made inroads into previously nonunion companies like Starbucks and Amazon, and won unusually strong contracts for hundreds of thousands of workers. Last year, public approval for unions reached its highest level since the Lyndon Johnson presidency.
What unions haven't had during that stretch is a true gut-check moment on a national scale. Strikes by railroad workers and UPS employees, which had the potential to rattle the U.S. economy, were averted at the last minute. The fallout from the continuing writers' and actors' strikes has been heavily concentrated in Southern California.
The strike by the United Automobile Workers, whose members walked off the job at three plants on Friday, is shaping up to be such a test. A contract with substantial wage increases and other concessions from the three automakers could announce organized labor as an economic force to be reckoned with and accelerate a recent wave of organizing.
But there are also real pitfalls. A prolonged strike could undermine the three established U.S. automakers -- General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- and send the politically crucial Midwest into recession. If the union is seen as overreaching, or if it settles for a weak deal after a costly stoppage, public support could sour.
"Right now, unions are cool," said Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, a firm representing management.
"But unions have a risk of not being very cool if you have five-month strike in L.A and an X-month strike in how many other states," he added.
If the stakes seem high for the U.A.W., that's partly because the union's new president, Shawn Fain, has gone out of his way to elevate them. During frequent video meetings with members before the strike, Mr. Fain has portrayed the negotiations as a broader struggle pitting ordinary workers against corporate titans.
"I know that we're on the right side in this battle," he said in a recent video appearance. "It's a battle of the working class against the rich, the haves versus the have-nots, the billionaire class against everybody else."
Mr. Fain's framing of the contract campaign in class terms appears to be resonating with his members, thousands of whom have watched the online sessions.

Be Wary of Companies Selling Credit 'Repair' Services: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Consumers have a right to dispute mistakes on their credit reports. But if they've made late payments, that can't be erased, consumer experts say.
Anyone whose credit score has been marred by late payments or financial stumbles can understand the allure of a quick fix that scrubs tarnished credit. But beware the companies that sell credit "repair" services over the phone and charge fees upfront.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reached a $ 2.7 billion settlement in August with PGX Holdings, a group of companies, including Progrexion Marketing, that ran a large credit repair operation under brands like Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com.
Credit repair companies typically bombard credit bureaus with dispute letters in the hope of getting negative marks deleted, said Andrew Pizor, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. (The bureaus can ignore disputes that don't come directly from consumers, he said.) Occasionally, the repair companies' efforts may work, Mr. Pizor said, but any benefit is often temporary. If you've stopped repaying a loan, that information will reappear on your report when the lender sends an update to the credit bureau.
If the negative information is accurate, there's generally no way to have it erased, Mr. Pizor said. Negative information like missed or late payments remains on your credit report for seven years, he said, and a personal bankruptcy stays there for 10 years. Paying for credit repair, he said, is "really a waste of money for the vast majority of people."
Consumers have the right to dispute mistakes on their credit reports and to have the errors corrected promptly -- though it can sometimes be frustrating. "Our view is that people shouldn't need to pay a third party," said Jonah Kaplan, senior program manager of consumer reporting markets at the consumer bureau. "They can do it for themselves for free."
The consumer bureau's settlement stems from a lawsuit that the bureau filed in Federal District Court in Utah, claiming that the companies collected illegal upfront fees for credit repair services sold via telemarketing in violation of federal law. Credit repair companies can't ask for or receive fees until six months after they have achieved results for the customer, the bureau said. In March, the court ruled in the bureau's favor.
It's uncertain how much money consumers will see from the settlement. PGX Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in June. The consumer bureau, in a statement about the settlement, said the victims' relief fund at the agency could possibly be used to make payments "to those harmed by the perpetrators."
As part of the settlement, the companies were barred from telemarketing credit repair services for 10 years and must notify customers of the settlement and explain the process for canceling the service.
Eric M. Kamerath, a spokesman for PGX Holdings, said the company "will continue to comply with the court's ruling while helping consumers who would otherwise live with inaccurate and unsubstantiated credit reports."
The settlement is the latest salvo in the bureau's crackdown on credit repair outfits. In a statement, its director, Rohit Chopra, called credit repair companies a "scam." The Federal Trade Commission has also taken action recently against them.
As delinquencies on credit card debt have risen to prepandemic levels, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling has seen a "steady increase" in demand for credit counseling services since the spring of 2022, said Bruce McClary, a spokesman for the foundation. According to reports from its member agencies, he said, both counseling activity and enrollment in debt-management plans have returned to prepandemic levels.
Some background: The three major credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- compile details about your payment history into credit reports. They provide the reports to banks, lenders and other companies, which use them to decide if you're a good credit risk. If you fall behind or stop paying a debt, that shows up on your reports and hurts your credit score -- a three-digit summary of your credit record -- making it harder to qualify for new loans at favorable rates.
If you're having trouble repaying your debt and your credit is suffering, one alternative is to seek advice from a nonprofit consumer credit counseling agency, Mr. Pizor of the National Consumer Law Center said. Such groups can assess your financial situation and, if you qualify, arrange for a debt management plan, which will allow you to pay off your debts over time, typically in three to five years. Some agencies may charge a fee, which is offset by a lower interest rate negotiated by the agency.
Research on borrowers who took advantage of payment pauses from their credit card companies during the pandemic and then enrolled in nonprofit debt-management plans were significantly less likely to default than similar borrowers who did not participate in such plans, said David Silberman, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsible Lending.
But he said consumers should be skeptical of debt "settlement" companies because they typically encouraged consumers to stop paying their lenders. Instead, borrowers send money to the settlement company, which aims to use the funds to prod the lender into settling by accepting less money than is owed. (The company takes a cut.)
But if the effort isn't successful, customers can end up with poorer credit than when they started, Mr. Silberman said. "They've dug a deeper hole," he added.
If a credit counseling firm doesn't think you earn enough to pay off your debts in a reasonable amount of time, personal bankruptcy -- a legal proceeding for getting relief from debts you can't pay -- may be an option. That is a serious step, however, because it may be difficult to gain access to credit for years afterward.
Here are some questions and answers about managing debt:
How can I find a reputable credit counseling agency?
You can search online at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Also, the Justice Department maintains a list of agencies that are approved to provide pre-bankruptcy counseling. These groups often offer other services, including credit counseling and debt-management plans.
Are there credit cards and loans that can help bolster my credit?
Some banks and credit unions offer secured credit cards, which allow users to make a refundable cash deposit -- usually a few hundred dollars -- that serves as collateral for purchases made with the card. Eventually, cardholders can build a repayment record that improves their credit score, allowing them to advance to a traditional card with a higher borrowing limit. Discover and Amazon are also among those offering secured cards.
Another option may be a "credit builder" loan, offered by community banks as well as online lenders. With credit builder loans, the lender typically deposits your money into a separate savings account. You get the money -- usually minus a fee -- after you make monthly installments equal to the original amount.
What's the best way to protect my credit score?
Paying bills on time and keeping your use of credit low -- meaning not maxing out your cards -- can help maintain a good score. You should also check your credit reports for errors. You can get reports free from the big bureaus -- as often as weekly through the end of this year -- at a special website, www.annualcreditreport.com.

FTX Leader Explains All In 250 Pages: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The FTX founder wrote hundreds of pages of reflections and self-justifications while under house arrest, shedding light on how he may defend himself at his criminal trial next month.
At the end of a 15,000-word Twitter thread he never posted, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, offered a blunt assessment of his predicament.
"I'm broke and wearing an ankle monitor and one of the most hated people in the world," he wrote. "There will probably never be anything I can do to make my lifetime impact net positive."
He added: "And the truth is that I did what I thought was right."
After Mr. Bankman-Fried was arrested, charged with fraud over FTX's collapse and placed in home detention in December, he wrote hundreds of pages of sometimes rambling self-justifications, ranging from childhood memories to mathematical calculations.
In a draft of his unsent posts, which he formatted as a series of tweets spanning roughly 70 typed pages, he criticized some of his closest colleagues, interspersing his arguments with photos from his high school years and stock images of popcorn and a garden maze. Every few pages, a key moment in the narrative is accompanied with a link to a music video by Alicia Keys, Katy Perry or Rihanna.
Once a prolific poster on Twitter, now known as X, Mr. Bankman-Fried, 31, labeled the thread "a draft of a draft of a draft of an idea" and included links to 29 other files about FTX. One document, titled "Inception V2," is a lengthy attack on the company's bankruptcy lawyers, featuring a screenshot from the 2010 Christopher Nolan movie. A separate link pulls up a spreadsheet listing Mr. Bankman-Fried's Amazon orders from 2021.
The roughly 250 pages of documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a window into Mr. Bankman-Fried's mind-set during the eight months he spent in home detention before a judge revoked his bail in August. The writings also offer new details about his possible legal defense beyond what his lawyers have revealed in court, shedding light on how he may justify his actions when his trial starts on Oct. 3.
Prosecutors have charged Mr. Bankman-Fried with orchestrating a scheme to funnel FTX customer funds to a hedge fund he founded, Alameda Research, so that his companies could make venture capital investments, buy real estate and donate to politicians. He has pleaded not guilty and faces decades in prison if convicted.
During his house arrest, Mr. Bankman-Fried sent the documents to Tiffany Fong, a social media influencer who has a YouTube channel about the crypto industry. Ms. Fong shared them with The New York Times.
"He liked that I don't work for anybody," she said. "He thinks I can just sort of come to my own conclusions."
A representative for Mr. Bankman-Fried declined to comment.
In several documents, Mr. Bankman-Fried blamed Caroline Ellison, his former girlfriend and onetime lieutenant, for helping to cause FTX's implosion. He described her as ill equipped for the job he gave her as head of Alameda, claiming she had cried during a meeting with him and refused to institute trading strategies that would have protected his businesses from a market crash.
"She continually avoided talking about risk management -- dodging my suggestions -- until it was too late," he wrote in a document titled "Alameda's Failure to Hedge." "Every time that I reached out with suggestions, it just made her feel worse. I'm sure that being exes didn't help."
In the Twitter draft, Mr. Bankman-Fried also criticized Sam Trabucco, who was co-chief executive of Alameda. Mr. Trabucco and Ms. Ellison didn't get along, the document said. And while Mr. Trabucco had good instincts for risk management, Mr. Bankman-Fried wrote, he "was in the process of quiet quitting" by late 2021.
Mr. Trabucco preferred to spend his time "going on dates with a ton of guys while sailing around the world on a boat," Mr. Bankman-Fried wrote. Then he linked to a music video, "Cheers (Drink to That)" by Rihanna.
Ms. Ellison and two of Mr. Bankman-Fried's other top advisers have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to testify against him. A fourth pleaded guilty this month without promising to cooperate. Mr. Trabucco has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
Lawyers for Mr. Trabucco and Ms. Ellison declined to comment.
Once hailed as a trustworthy force in the loosely regulated world of crypto, FTX imploded in November, costing customers billions of dollars and devastating the industry. After his arrest, Mr. Bankman-Fried was granted bail and allowed to live with his parents, who are longtime law professors at Stanford, in their home in Palo Alto, Calif. They got a German shepherd named Sandor to act as his guard dog.
For months, Mr. Bankman-Fried entertained guests like the author Michael Lewis, who is finishing a book about him, as well as several reporters.
Few people had as much access as Ms. Fong, the influencer, who had struck up an online rapport with Mr. Bankman-Fried before FTX failed. Ms. Fong visited him at his parents' home more than 10 times, she said, and recorded conversations with him that she may eventually release.
During house arrest, Mr. Bankman-Fried spent much of his time in the study, Ms. Fong said, where he played computer games, set up a chessboard and sometimes slept on the couch. Most days, she said, he worked on his legal defense, recording thoughts about the case on hundreds of pages of Google documents. Mr. Bankman-Fried also told her that his family was installing a pickleball court for him in the yard.
Mr. Bankman-Fried gave Ms. Fong the documents in late January. It was not clear what he expected her to do with them. Ms. Fong, who lost money in the collapse of the crypto company Celsius Network, said she sympathized with FTX's victims and was skeptical of many of Mr. Bankman-Fried's claims. She sent one document to a former Alameda engineer, Aditya Baradwaj, who responded to her with a point-by-point rebuttal to Mr. Bankman-Fried, noting that Alameda's hedging would have been "irrelevant" if FTX hadn't misused customer money.
In the draft Twitter thread, Mr. Bankman-Fried traced the growth of his businesses from his childhood in Palo Alto to the penthouse he bought in the Bahamas near FTX's headquarters. He recalled meeting Mr. Trabucco at a math camp, where his future colleague sneaked out after curfew to bake cheesecake brownies, and he described his early admiration for Ms. Ellison, calling her "wicked smart." He also inserted some personal photos, including one that shows him holding a shirt that Mr. Trabucco had bought him in high school.
In another section, Mr. Bankman-Fried posted a link to a document he wrote in 2019, "Tonight We Are Young," an account of a conference in Taiwan where he interacted with Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, the founder of the Binance crypto exchange. (He also included a link to the "We Are Young" music video by Fun.)
"Tonight was a night about booze and women and lasers and loud, booming music, but there was an odd microclimate that seemed to follow me," Mr. Bankman-Fried wrote. "I walked by CZ a few more times, and each time he broke eye contact with his eye candy and embraced me: People were thinking about us, a lot."
In November, Mr. Zhao's posts set off a run on deposits that helped prompt FTX's implosion. A Binance representative did not respond to a request for comment.
Some of Mr. Bankman-Fried's documents elaborate on arguments that his lawyers have made in court. In files titled "Inception V2," "Inception V3" and "Inception Evidence," Mr. Bankman-Fried claimed that Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm overseeing FTX's bankruptcy, constructed the narrative that he misappropriated user funds.
"They've played it incredibly well," he wrote. "Were it not destructive to just about everything I care about in life, I would tip my cap to them."
A Sullivan & Cromwell spokesman declined to comment. Prosecutors have argued that Mr. Bankman-Fried's claims about the firm amount to "innuendo."
Across several documents, Mr. Bankman-Fried also dissected his history with Ms. Ellison, writing that their relationship ended "the same way most of my relationships end."
"They want more intimacy and commitment and public visibility than I do," he wrote in the thread, "and I feel claustrophobic."
In another document, he said Ms. Ellison had refused to hedge Alameda's aggressive trading strategy, despite his urging. At one point, he recalled, he sent her a message that amounted to "the meanest thing I've ever said to her." (He said he no longer had a record of the message.)
"If Alameda had hedged, it would have remained solvent and prevented the entire unhappy story," he wrote.
His concerns about Alameda heightened in spring 2022 as he packed for a trip to Washington, Mr. Bankman-Fried wrote in the Twitter draft. A group of employees including Ms. Ellison was frantically discussing a possible deficit in the firm's accounts. Mr. Bankman-Fried was only half-engaged, he wrote, but had heard enough to realize that the conversation centered on an account labeled fiat@ -- the vehicle that regulators have said FTX executives used to redirect customer funds into other projects.
"I had heard that name before, but I'd never really known exactly what it was," he wrote.
When she pleaded guilty, Ms. Ellison said she and Mr. Bankman-Fried had conspired to shore up Alameda's finances with customer money. He has denied misusing the funds.
"As a general matter, I don't lie," he wrote in a document titled "Truth." "It's something that I believe fairly strongly in."

A 70-Page Twitter Thread: Sam Bankman-Fried’s Writings During House Arrest

Full text: Enlarge this image.
At the end of a 15,000-word Twitter thread he never posted, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, offered a blunt assessment of his predicament.
“I’m broke and wearing an ankle monitor and one of the most hated people in the world,” he wrote. “There will probably never be anything I can do to make my lifetime impact net positive.”
He added: “And the truth is that I did what I thought was right.”
After Bankman-Fried was arrested, charged with fraud over FTX’s collapse and placed in home detention in December, he wrote hundreds of pages of sometimes rambling self-justifications, ranging from childhood memories to mathematical calculations. In a draft of his unsent posts, which he formatted as a series of tweets spanning roughly 70 typed pages, he criticized some of his closest colleagues, interspersing his arguments with photos from his high school years and stock images of popcorn and a garden maze. Every few pages, a key moment in the narrative is accompanied with a link to a music video by Alicia Keys, Katy Perry or Rihanna.
Once a prolific poster on Twitter, now known as X, Bankman-Fried, 31, labeled the thread “a draft of a draft of a draft of an idea” and included links to 29 other files about FTX. One document, titled “Inception V2,” is a lengthy attack on the company’s bankruptcy lawyers, featuring a screenshot from the 2010 Christopher Nolan movie. A separate link pulls up a spreadsheet listing Bankman-Fried’s Amazon orders from 2021.
The roughly 250 pages of documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a window into Bankman-Fried’s mindset during the eight months he spent in home detention before a judge revoked his bail in August. The writings also offer new details about his possible legal defense beyond what his lawyers have revealed in court, shedding light on how he may justify his actions when his trial starts Oct. 3.
Prosecutors have charged Bankman-Fried with orchestrating a scheme to funnel FTX customer funds to a hedge fund he founded, Alameda Research, so that his companies could make venture capital investments, buy real estate and donate to politicians. He has pleaded not guilty and faces decades in prison if convicted.
During his house arrest, Bankman-Fried sent the documents to Tiffany Fong, a social-media influencer who has a YouTube channel about the crypto industry. Fong shared them with The New York Times. “He liked that I don’t work for anybody,” she said. “He thinks I can just sort of come to my own conclusions.”
A representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment.
In several documents, Bankman-Fried blamed Caroline Ellison, his former girlfriend and onetime lieutenant, for helping to cause FTX’s implosion. He described her as ill-equipped for the job he gave her as head of Alameda, claiming she had cried during a meeting with him and refused to institute trading strategies that would have protected his businesses from a market crash.
“She continually avoided talking about risk management — dodging my suggestions — until it was too late,” he wrote in a document titled “Alameda’s Failure to Hedge.” “Every time that I reached out with suggestions, it just made her feel worse. I’m sure that being exes didn’t help.”
In the Twitter draft, Bankman-Fried also criticized Sam Trabucco, who was co-CEO of Alameda. Trabucco and Ellison didn’t get along, the document said. And while Trabucco had good instincts for risk management, Bankman-Fried wrote, he “was in the process of quiet quitting” by late 2021.
Trabucco preferred to spend his time “going on dates with a ton of guys while sailing around the world on a boat,” Bankman-Fried wrote. Then he linked to a music video, “Cheers (Drink to That)” by Rihanna.
Ellison and two of Bankman-Fried’s other top advisers have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to testify against him. A fourth pleaded guilty this month without promising to cooperate. Trabucco has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
Lawyers for Trabucco and Ellison declined to comment.
Once hailed as a trustworthy force in the loosely regulated world of crypto, FTX imploded in November, costing customers billions of dollars and devastating the industry. After his arrest, Bankman-Fried was granted bail and allowed to live with his parents, who are longtime law professors at Stanford, in their home in Palo Alto, California. They got a German shepherd named Sandor to act as his guard dog.
For months, Bankman-Fried entertained guests like author Michael Lewis, who is finishing a book about him, as well as several reporters.
Few people had as much access as Fong, who had struck up an online rapport with Bankman-Fried before FTX failed. Fong visited him at his parents’ home more than 10 times, she said, and recorded conversations with him that she may eventually release.

Semiconductor Firm Juggles Issues Before 2023's Biggest I.P.O.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The SoftBank-owned company, which for decades has defined how mobile phones operate, is grappling with geopolitical and commercial complexities as it prepares to go public this week.
Rene Haas, the chief executive of the chip-design powerhouse Arm, has many masters to serve.
He reports to Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, which owns Arm and plans to sell a portion of the British company this week in the year's biggest initial public offering. Officials in Beijing and Washington also command Mr. Haas's attention amid a widening chip trade war, as does Britain's prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and others who have unsuccessfully pitched the idea of a stock listing in the country.
And Mr. Haas must juggle the demands of more than 200 companies that use Arm's technology. Ten of the biggest -- including Apple, Google, Samsung and Nvidia -- have been negotiating for stakes in the highly anticipated Arm offering as artificial intelligence drives explosive demand for more powerful chips.
"It's only going to get more and more complex," Mr. Haas said in a speech in May at a trade show in Taiwan. "I'm an old person in this industry. I've never seen it like this."
Few companies face as many geopolitical and commercial complexities as Arm, the creator of the most widely used computing architecture of all time. Its public offering, which is expected to start trading on Thursday and to value the company around $ 52 billion, will signal Arm's ability to weather those challenges and enter new markets. How Arm performs will also influence the market for public listings, which has been quiet for much of the year.
There are "a lot of companies to please and a lot of capitals to please," Jodi Shelton, chief executive of the Global Semiconductor Alliance, a big trade group, said of Arm. Mr. Haas, she added, "has to not only play diplomat on a global level but to customers."
Arm is in a quiet period before its public offering, with Mr. Haas expected to help ring the Nasdaq opening bell in New York on Thursday.
Founded in 1990, Arm has for decades helped define how nearly all mobile phones operate, despite having only about 6,000 employees and less than $ 3 billion in annual revenue. Its technology has also spread to cars, sensors, supercomputers and myriad other devices.
Unlike most chip companies, Arm does not make or sell those silicon components. It essentially designs and licenses blueprints for one of the most important parts of a chip -- processor cores, which perform calculations and run software programs.
Those electronic brains rely on a set of instructions that Arm developed, and that programs like Google's Android and Apple's iOS operating systems use to carry out basic operations on smartphones.
Companies typically design entire chips by placing the blueprints for Arm's cores alongside those handling other functions, which they may design or license. That means many companies watch Arm's technical specifications and future plans closely.
"There are very different interests that have to be balanced," said Aart de Geus, the chief executive of Synopsys, which sells software for designing chips along with specialized chip cores and aims to invest in Arm's offering. "We all have to play really well together to make anything work."
Arm estimates that more than 250 billion chips using its technology have been sold since its founding in 1990. That was when Apple and two partners established what was originally called Advanced RISC Machines in Cambridge, England. Apple wanted low-powered technology that would extend battery life in the Newton, its ill-fated personal digital assistant, which was discontinued in 1998.
"The DNA of the company was born building products that run off batteries, and that sensibility still defines us today," Mr. Haas said in a video presentation for Arm's I.P.O. roadshow, where it pitches to investors.
Mr. Haas, 61, is the first American to run Arm, which still conducts most engineering in Cambridge. He grew up in a suburb of Rochester, N.Y., where his father was a Xerox research scientist and exposed him to Silicon Valley's allure on a childhood visit to Xerox's research center there.
After earning an electrical and electronics engineering degree from Clarkson University, Mr. Haas worked for a chip maker and a start-up before a seven-year stint at Nvidia, a dominant provider of graphics and artificial-intelligence chips.
He joined Arm in 2013. After lobbying for changes in its China business, Mr. Haas was transferred to Shanghai.
In 2016, SoftBank bought Arm for $ 32 billion, inspired partly by Mr. Son's ultimately unsuccessful idea of selling services to help coordinate and deliver software to billions of devices equipped with Arm chips. Mr. Haas moved to London to lead the rest of Arm's business, and began pushing for changes there.
Among other things, he introduced licensing schemes with annual subscriptions for a bundle of Arm technologies, reducing the need for repeated negotiations for individual products. Arm also shifted from a longtime practice of designing cores for smartphones and adapting them for other applications. It now designs cores from scratch for new markets like data centers and cars.
In September 2020, Nvidia reached a deal to buy Arm from SoftBank for $ 40 billion. That plan collapsed 18 months later after opposition from regulators and customers. Mr. Son picked Mr. Haas in February 2022 to succeed Simon Segars as chief executive.
An imposing figure at 6 feet 4 inches, Mr. Haas introduced new ideas with a collaborative style, associates said. He "has really transformed Arm," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, in the roadshow video.
With Arm in the middle of tech supply chains and the chip trade war, Mr. Haas is grappling with challenges, including slowing sales of smartphones and the question of whether the company can play a big role in A.I. chores in data centers.
Another comes from China, where Arm gets roughly a quarter of its revenue and licensing is handled by Arm China, a company that it does not control. Arm weathered a long-running battle with Arm China's leader, who was ousted last year, but payments and sales information from that company have sometimes been late, the I.P.O. prospectus said.
Trade tensions also loom large. Sales of one powerful version of an Arm core for data centers have been hobbled by American and British restrictions on Chinese exports. Though Arm said it had worked around such limits so far, the possibility of tougher rules stands out among numerous risks concerning China described in the prospectus.
There are also questions about Arm's business model. Arm historically negotiated with chip makers to receive an upfront licensing fee, which might range from $ 10 million to $ 100 million depending on the technology involved, plus a per-chip royalty of around $ 1 to $ 3.50, estimated Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research.
But lower-cost alternatives have emerged, including RISC-V, a technology whose instruction set can be licensed for free.
Arm also faces a legal battle with a major customer, Qualcomm, a big supplier of mobile chips. Arm sued Qualcomm, saying it violated a licensing contract in connection with buying a chip start-up, Nuvia. Qualcomm denied the accusations and plans to begin offering chips developed by the former Nuvia team, underscoring how more customers may license just the Arm instruction set and then design original processor cores.
Though Arm has penetrated data centers in chips designed by Amazon and Ampere Computing, a start-up, it has yet to experience the kind of A.I. sales surge there that Nvidia has enjoyed.
Handel Jones, head of the research firm International Business Strategies, said Arm's biggest A.I. opportunity would be in phones, PCs and other so-called edge applications where devices need low power consumption.
"If Arm can play the role that Nvidia plays in data centers at the edge, then that I.P.O. valuation can be justified," Mr. Jones said. "They are a long way from getting there yet."

Likening Google's Antitrust Trial to Microsoft's: [National Desk]

Author: Lohr, Steve

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The government's antitrust case against Google borrows heavily from the landmark lawsuit against Microsoft 25 years ago. But it lacks the same cultural impact.
The Justice Department argues in a federal antitrust suit that Google is a dominant tech company that has abused its market power to bully industry partners, protect its monopoly and thwart competition.
That has a familiar ring. As U.S. et al. v. Google goes to trial this week, the echoes of the landmark federal suit against Microsoft, a quarter-century ago, are unmistakable. In the Google case, as with Microsoft then, a tech giant is accused of using its overwhelming market power to unfairly cut competitors off from potential customers.
But on the eve of the Google trial, it seems unimaginable that the case could command the widespread attention that the Microsoft proceedings did. Microsoft in the late 1990s was a singular tech titan and its leader, Bill Gates, was a national icon.
The Microsoft trial, which began in October 1998, spanned 76 days of testimony over more than eight months. Every major news organization covered it. The New York Times reported on the proceedings daily.
It was a trial that often dealt with cerebral concepts like "network effects" and "switching costs." Yet The Times gave it the kind of day-to-day coverage ordinarily reserved for very few courtroom dramas over the years, like the O.J. Simpson trial and the Lindbergh kidnapping trial.
Many days, there were spin sessions on the courthouse steps. Microsoft representatives would say the government had presented isolated snippets of text, taken out of context, certainly not proof of anti-competitive conduct. Lawyers for the Justice Department and states who joined the lawsuit would mostly say the damning testimony spoke for itself.
Microsoft was found by a federal judge to have repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. An appeals court upheld most of that decision but was skeptical of the government's preferred remedy -- breaking up the company.
In its lawsuit against Google, the Justice Department points to the Microsoft case and that company's tactics in the 1990s. "Google deploys the same playbook," the government declares, by illegally wielding its might in online search much as Microsoft did with its personal computer operating system, Windows.
But Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said there were big differences between the Microsoft of the dot-com boom and today's Google. Back then, Mr. Walker was deputy general counsel of Netscape, the commercial pioneer of internet browsing software, which was the main target of Microsoft's campaign to hobble competition.
About 90 percent of personal computers used Microsoft's Windows software, the main gateway to the young internet, and Microsoft controlled the software and services that were featured on those Windows PC screens.
Google, on the other hand, has to work with and pay partners that make smartphones, browsers and other devices, Mr. Walker said. Its deals with companies like Apple and Samsung to make Google the default search engine on their smartphones are legal and benefit consumers, giving them the best technology and reducing costs for device makers and their customers, he said.
"We think there are aspects of the Microsoft case that are actually very helpful to us here," Mr. Walker said in an interview.
When the Microsoft trial started, it was the high tide of early internet euphoria. E-commerce was just getting underway, and every industry wanted to jump on the digital bandwagon. This was before mobile computing. The first Blackberry, essentially an email device, was introduced in 1999. The iPhone, which started the smartphone era, didn't arrive until 2007. If you wanted to get online, chances are you did it through a computer that ran Windows.
Microsoft was rich, powerful and ambitious. It had started to move beyond software. In 1996, it entered the media business in a partnership with NBC, setting up the cable channel, MSNBC, and a website, msnbc.com (Microsoft shed its stakes in both, years later).
Executives in industry after industry worried about what Microsoft might do next, sharing a sentiment expressed by Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp: "Everybody in the communications business is paranoid of Microsoft, including me."
Today, Google does not loom as large as Microsoft once did. It is one member of the Big Tech club. It is an undisputed giant in search and online advertising, and its software and artificial intelligence prowess can extend to other industries. But its Big Tech peers -- Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) and even Microsoft -- are all under scrutiny in the United States and abroad.
The Microsoft case also had a huge personal dimension because of the stature of Mr. Gates. He was the world's richest person, and during the course of the trial, as the stock market surged, Mr. Gates's stake in Microsoft soared to $ 100 billion. In 1995, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built a website, called the Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock, to track Mr. Gates's net worth.
Mr. Gates was widely admired as a brilliant entrepreneur, polls showed. He was Microsoft's leader, deeply involved in company operations and especially its internet strategy. He viewed the government's antitrust pursuit as an assault on his life's work, colleagues said.
Mr. Gates was not a witness at the trial, but excerpts from his videotaped deposition testimony were shown. He was quibbling, unresponsive and forgetful. At one point, he seemed not to understand the term "market share." (The joke immediately afterward was that "share" was the concept he didn't grasp.)
Later, Microsoft officials said Mr. Gates had merely been following legal advice he was given to narrow questions and avoid broad or responsive answers. If so, it was bad advice. His deposition testimony undermined his credibility -- and Microsoft's -- with the judge.
Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, have a far less prominent role in the current case. They are no longer deeply involved in the company. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google's parent company, Alphabet, is a thoughtful, soft-spoken company man who joined Google in 2004 and rose through the ranks.
Although the legal theory advanced by the Justice Department mirrors the one used in the Microsoft case, the outcome of the trial will hinge on the evidence presented to Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The government has already suggested its evidence will lack the vivid language of the Microsoft case. There is no equivalent of "cut off Netscape's air supply" or piles of email filled with no-holds-barred terminology.
In the Google suit, the government cited the search company's instructions to its employees to avoid words like "kill," "crush" and "block" in their emails.
"Google did learn one thing from Microsoft -- to choose its words carefully to avoid antitrust scrutiny," the Justice Department wrote.
For its part, the government has understandably borrowed heavily from the Microsoft case in its lawsuit against Google because those legal theories "worked so well against Microsoft," said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
After the George W. Bush administration came to power, the Justice Department and Microsoft reached a settlement. The resulting consent decree prohibited Microsoft from imposing restrictive contracts, freed PC makers to load and feature other companies' software and forced Microsoft to disclose more technical information.
Many people criticized the consent decree as toothless. David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, was initially a critic, but his views have changed.
Today, Mr. Yoffie teaches a course on antitrust and technology, and it begins with the Microsoft consent decree. "There were a litany of actions that were no longer possible because of the consent decree," he said. "It did limit Microsoft's ability to go after newcomers, not ones trying to compete with Microsoft head-on but at an angle."
The leading beneficiary of the more open environment, Mr. Yoffie said, was an internet search start-up, with new technology and later a new business model. It was called Google. It was founded in September 1998, one month before the Microsoft trial began.

Minimum Corporate Tax Is Big Challenge for Biden: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Large companies are bracing for the impact of a 15 percent tax that went into effect this year.
At his State of the Union address this year, President Biden celebrated the fact that his new climate and tax law would no longer allow some of America's largest corporations to pay zero in federal taxes.
"Because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent," Mr. Biden said, referring to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. "God love them."
The new corporate minimum tax was one of the most significant changes to the U.S. tax code in decades. Its logic rested on the idea that rich companies should not be able to find loopholes and other accounting maneuvers in order to pay lower tax rates than their workers.
But making the tax operational has become a mammoth challenge for the Biden administration, which has faced intense lobbying from industries that could be on the hook for billions of dollars in new taxes. Those groups have been flooding the Treasury Department with letters asking for lenient interpretations of the law and trying to create new loopholes before their tax bills come due next year. Republican lawmakers have been trying to repeal the law while Democrats such as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have been urging Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen to enforce it strictly.
The legislation, which passed with no Republican support, called for the corporate minimum tax to take effect in the 2023 tax year, meaning it will apply to corporate profits earned this year. But the tax was only loosely defined, and Treasury is still writing the rules that will determine how it is carried out.
The corporate minimum tax is entirely separate from the 15 percent "global minimum tax" that the Biden administration brokered with more than 140 nations in 2021. That agreement was aimed at stopping large multinational companies from seeking out tax havens and forcing them to pay more of their income to governments. While the deal is moving ahead in other nations, it continues to face obstacles in the United States, where Congress has been unable to ratify the agreement and allow the United States to comply with the global rules.
But Democrats were able last year to pass a domestic corporate minimum tax, which is a revival of a policy that was last employed in the 1980s. It captures tax revenue from companies that report a profit to shareholders on their financial statements, known as book income, while bulking up on deductions to whittle down their tax bills.
While the corporate tax rate stands at 21 percent, many large companies pay far less than that to the federal government. For years, big companies such as FedEx, Duke Energy and Nike have been able to take advantage of various deductions and tax strategies so that they effectively owe nothing in federal taxes. A 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 55 of the nation's largest companies had paid no federal income tax the previous year.
An analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation last year found that about 150 companies with tax rates below 15 percent would be subject to the new tax. Companies like Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway, which have had effective tax rates in the single digits in recent years, could face the biggest increases in their tax liabilities, according to a summary of research about the impact of the tax published by the Congressional Research Service.
At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Warren E. Buffett, the company's chief executive, acknowledged that there was uncertainty over the new tax but said he did not oppose it.
"We can figure out ways, once we know the rules, where we will pay the 15 percent tax," Mr. Buffett said.
While the tax is aimed at some of the largest companies, smaller businesses have also expressed concern that they could be swept into the new tax regime if the regulations are not sufficiently clarified.
In a comment letter to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service this year, CenterPoint Energy, a public utility company based in Texas, said it could be unfairly targeted because it had sold part of its gas pipeline and storage operation. Even though CenterPoint paid taxes on the sale, the gains could raise the company's revenue enough to require it to pay additional money under the corporate alternative minimum tax.
"CenterPoint is neither a large corporation nor a corporation that did not pay its fair share but is being subjected to the C.A.M.T. as a result of transactions that reduced its business operations," the company wrote. "The incongruity of the result is striking."
The Treasury Department is expected to release the final rules for the tax before the end of the year. It already made concessions to the insurance industry, which raised concerns that the tax could upend its business model, and told companies that they would not be responsible for making quarterly tax payments related to the new minimum until all the regulations were clarified.
"Treasury is working to ensure that the biggest and most profitable corporations pay their fair share and that the corporate alternative minimum tax is workable and administrable," said Ashley Schapitl, a Treasury spokeswoman.
The 15 percent minimum tax applies to corporations that report annual income of more than $ 1 billion to shareholders but reduced their effective tax rate well below the statutory 21 percent. It was projected to raise over $ 200 billion over a decade.
Businesses that might face the new tax have been spending heavily to shape its scope and minimize their exposure.
According to Accountable.US, a nonpartisan watchdog group, large financial firms and industry groups representing international conglomerates spent more than $ 1 million during the first half of this year lobbying Congress over the corporate minimum tax and a 1 percent stock buyback excise tax that was also included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Accountable.US described that as a "significant" amount since Republicans already oppose the provision.
Many sectors are bracing for the tax's potential impact, but energy companies, the film industry, financial firms and foreign companies that operate in the United States are particularly concerned, according to a review of comment letters submitted to the federal government and corporate filings.
"We're trying to figure out how to add up apples and oranges, if you will, to make sense of it," said Nancy McLernon, president and chief executive of the Global Business Alliance, which represents international companies that have U.S. subsidiaries.
Ms. McLernon, whose organization has a working group trying to ensure that the new tax rules can work alongside international accounting standards, lamented that the measure had only made things more complicated for businesses that invested in the United States.
I.R.S. tax forms, which allow for an array of deductions, and financial statements shown to shareholders present different pictures of a company's performance. Investors use a firm's book income to get a clearer view of the health of a business; however, some analysts have suggested that companies may soon start to take steps to obscure that measure.
Big businesses that will be hit by the tax are now trying to figure out what kind of income will put them over the $ 1 billion threshold and what deductions they may be able to keep.
When the legislation passed last year, Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona persuaded her Democratic colleagues to preserve a valuable deduction, known as bonus depreciation, that is associated with purchases of machinery and equipment. Since then, businesses that spend money on repairs and maintenance of their equipment have tried to make the case that those expenses should be included in that carve-out. Other firms, such as film companies, have tried to make the case that the cost of making movies should still be deductible from the new tax.
Despite all the lobbying, most companies are still trying to figure out how the tax will work and how much they need to worry.
"Anybody who is within the scope of the corporate alternative minimum tax has some pretty meaningful unanswered questions," said Pat Brown, co-leader of PwC's Washington National Tax Services practice and a former Treasury official.
Tax and accounting experts have warned for years that this type of corporate minimum tax would not be easy. They contend that it creates a new tax base and has the potential to encourage companies to change how they report their financial income to seek out new loopholes.
William McBride, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, which has been critical of the new minimum tax, said it had been difficult to set up because it was misguided in the first place. He argued that trying to marry accounting rules and tax laws was a recipe for confusion.
"It's not clear if it's even resolvable in a way that's going to satisfy taxpayers such that they're not stuck with enormous compliance costs," Mr. McBride said.
Efforts to overturn the tax will be fruitless while Mr. Biden is in office, but that hasn't stopped Republican lawmakers from trying.
Backed by lobbyists from the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Mining Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Western Energy Alliance, Senate Republicans introduced legislation in May to repeal what they described as a "reckless and complicated" tax that targets job creators.

11 Things You Should Know About This N.F.L. Season: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a busy off-season, Damar Hamlin is back, Odell Beckham Jr. is a Raven, Sean Payton leads the Broncos, and 10 players are out because of gambling violations.
The N.F.L. off-season has gotten shorter since the regular season was extended to 17 games, and it certainly feels shorter, too, given that once-mundane calendar entries, such as the start of off-season workouts, are now treated like red-carpet events.
Yet the down time between last season and this one is still long enough that impactful free-agent signings, un-retirements and rules changes made months ago have receded to the background. Here's our refresher on the N.F.L. happenings to keep in mind as the regular season begins in earnest on Sunday.
Damar Hamlin is back.
Eight months after Hamlin, a Buffalo Bills safety, went into cardiac arrest during a "Monday Night Football" game, he made the team's 53-man roster and will backup starters Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Hamlin spent nearly a week in the intensive care unit of a Cincinnati hospital after he collapsed on the field following a collision during a Jan. 2 game against the Bengals. He was then transferred to a hospital in Buffalo.
He steadily passed checkpoints during the off-season, from being cleared to resume football activities in April to playing in his first game since the life-threatening medical event, an exhibition in August. "I made the choice that I wanted to play," Hamlin, 25, told reporters afterward, adding that he won't have any hesitation when he's on the field. Buffalo's Week 1 game is a return to "Monday Night Football," against the Jets in East Rutherford, N.J.
Eric Bieniemy left Kansas City for Washington.
After a decade working under Coach Andy Reid in Kansas City, first as the running backs coach and then as the offensive coordinator, Bieniemy is forging out for Washington, where he's the Commanders' sole offensive play-caller as well as an assistant head coach. Bieniemy worked with Reid to develop and run the league's most exciting offense, helmed by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, as the team won two Super Bowl rings in the past four seasons. But also during that time frame, Bieniemy interviewed for more than a dozen N.F.L. head-coaching jobs without receiving any offers.
In Washington, he has the chance to run an offense away from Reid's shadow. The transition hasn't been entirely smooth: Commanders Coach Ron Rivera said last month that some players were "concerned" with Bieniemy's intense coaching style, before Rivera apologized for putting "my foot in my mouth." Some intensity is clearly needed, as Bieniemy has been tasked with reviving an offense that has perennially ranked near the bottom of the league.
Tua Tagovailoa didn't retire.
After Tagovailoa, the Miami Dolphins' starting quarterback, sustained two diagnosed concussions during the 2022 season, he admitted in an April news conference that he considered retirement before concluding that he was not ready to walk away from football at age 25.
The N.F.L. modified its concussion protocol last season after an investigation into how doctors handled Tagovailoa's return to the field following a hard hit to the head in a game last September. Four days later, he again hit his head in another game and was taken to the hospital, and Tagovailoa then suffered his second diagnosed concussion on Christmas Day, sidelining him for the rest of the season. Tagovailoa said he took up jiu-jitsu this off-season to learn how to protect his body when he falls, an approach unproven to prevent head injury.
'Thursday Night Football' games can be flexed.
In another example of how the pursuit of media money shapes sports leagues, N.F.L. owners approved in May a resolution to bring flex scheduling to "Thursday Night Football" on a limited basis, for now. The rule will allow the league to move no more than two games from Sunday afternoon to Amazon's Thursday night broadcast. The league can only make those swaps of games scheduled between Weeks 13 and 17 and has to provide at least four weeks' notice.
The Giants co-owner John Mara spoke out against the change, suggesting that it wasn't in the best interests of players or fans, but the measure got enough votes from other team owners to pass for a one-season trial.
Brian Flores is calling the Vikings' defense.
After spending last season as a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach for Pittsburgh, Flores will call defensive plays for the Minnesota Vikings. A judge ruled in March that Flores's racial discrimination lawsuit against the N.F.L. and its teams can proceed through the judicial system rather than being moved behind closed doors in private arbitration. Flores, who is Black and of Honduran descent, filed suit in February 2022, accusing the league and its teams of discriminating against him and other coaches of color in its hiring practices.
Players can fair catch kickoffs.
In the latest rule change addressing plays that have been found to be the most dangerous, the N.F.L. this season will allow players to call for fair catches on kickoffs and on free kicks after a safety. If a player makes a fair catch behind their team's 25-yard line, the ball will then be placed at the 25, mirroring the rule that has been used in college games since 2018.
The league expects the return rate, and thus the number of concussions sustained on returns, to decrease as a result of this change, which will be evaluated and considered for permanent adoption after the season.
Ten players are serving gambling suspensions.
Widespread legalized sports betting in the United States has become increasingly entwined with the N.F.L., even as the league in the past year delivered its most extensive set of penalties for violations of its gambling policy. Ten players are currently serving suspensions, ranging from six-game penalties for betting on other sports while at team facilities to indefinite suspensions for betting on N.F.L. games.
The N.F.L. has asked the public to take its word that no games were compromised, while critics have pointed out the dissonance between the league's stringent penalties and its growing partnerships with betting companies.
Sean Payton is back.
Given the myriad ways Payton has made his presence known, such as by saying that Nathaniel Hackett's term with the Denver Broncos, in which he did not make it through a full season, was "one of the worst coaching jobs in the history of the N.F.L.," it's unlikely Payton is off anyone's radar.
But it is easy to forget that just a year ago, he spent Sundays sitting on the Fox Sports set as a commentator, having "retired" after 15 seasons leading the New Orleans Saints.
His run with the Saints, which included one Super Bowl ring, overlapped with that of quarterback Drew Brees. Now, Payton has perhaps the toughest challenge of his career: rehabilitating Russell Wilson. His approach has been hard-charging, starting with his proclamation at his introductory news conference in Denver that, unlike last season, Wilson's personal performance coaches would not be allowed in the team facility.
Odell Beckham Jr. is part of the Ravens' new-look offense.
After spending the 2022 season out of the league while recovering from a knee injury he sustained in Super Bowl LVI, Beckham signed with the Ravens in early April. He joined Baltimore just weeks before the team broke a stalemate with quarterback Lamar Jackson, whom it signed to a five-year, $ 260 million contract extension.
There's a good deal of anticipation around the league for how the Ravens' offense will look. Jackson has a new offensive coordinator, Todd Monken, for the first time since his first full season as an N.F.L. starter. Along with Beckham, the Ravens also added Zay Flowers and Nelson Agholor to a receiver group that had been spotty.
Teams can use an emergency third quarterback.
The last labor agreement between the N.F.L. and the players' union expanded game-day rosters to as many as 48 players, up from 46. A new rule put in place this off-season gives teams additional roster flexibility, allowing them to dress a 49th player as an emergency third quarterback. For the player to enter the game, two other quarterbacks on the game-day roster must be unavailable due to injury or disqualification.
The utility for this role came into focus during the N.F.C. championship, when both the San Francisco 49ers' quarterbacks were injured during the game, forcing the starter Brock Purdy to return after he had injured his throwing elbow. The 49ers lost, 31-7, to the Philadelphia Eagles.
The Super Bowl will be in Las Vegas for the first time.
When the Raiders moved to Las Vegas from Oakland, Calif., in 2020, the team brought with it the possibility of the N.F.L. world descending on The Strip for marquee events, even if the team's performance of late has kept it far from the league's biggest games. After hosting two Pro Bowls, Allegiant Stadium will welcome its first Super Bowl this season, though not without caution for players and personnel around the league: New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara is serving a three-game suspension for his role in a fight in Las Vegas on the eve of the 2022 Pro Bowl. And Super Bowl LVIII is sure to be plastered with betting advertisements and partnerships, while the league continues its crackdown on potential violations of its gambling policy by players.

Satirical Film Lampoons Trade Titans: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The film tells the story about the stock market frenzy over the video game retailer GameStop. It was financed and produced by the son of a Wall Street superpower.
"Dumb Money" is the kind of midbudget, formula-busting, thinking-person's movie that isn't supposed to get made anymore, much less receive a wide, studio-backed release in theaters.
It tells the bizarre true story of small investors -- a nurse, college students, a YouTube personality known as Roaring Kitty -- who created a Wall Street frenzy over the troubled video game retailer GameStop during the pandemic. Determined to teach professional investors a lesson, and hopefully get rich in the process, they pushed GameStop shares to a stratospheric level in early 2021, for a time putting the squeeze on sophisticated hedge funds that had bet that GameStop shares would fall.
The $ 30 million film, directed by Craig Gillespie ("Cruella"), contains withering depictions of real-life Wall Street figures like Kenneth C. Griffin, the Citadel titan; Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner; and Gabe Plotkin, whose hedge fund lost billions in the squeeze. In one colorful scene, Mr. Cohen, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, sits in a mansion snarfing a club sandwich and snorting with laughter on the phone with Mr. Plotkin, played by Seth Rogen.
"I honestly can't tell if that's you or Romeo," Mr. Plotkin says, referring to Mr. Cohen's pet pig. The camera cuts to the animal. Mr. Cohen gleefully tosses deli meat on the carpet for it to eat.
In a twist that makes "Dumb Money" even more unusual, the film was financed and produced by Teddy Schwarzman, whose father, Stephen A. Schwarzman, is also a Wall Street superpower and the chief executive of Blackstone, the private equity behemoth that has more than $ 1 trillion under management. Without Teddy Schwarzman's last-minute investment -- he stepped in with financing after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer balked -- "Dumb Money" would not exist, according to Rebecca Angelo and Lauren Schuker Blum, former Wall Street Journal reporters who wrote the screenplay and served as executive producers.
"When no one else believed in this film, Teddy came in pretty heroically," Ms. Blum said.
The "Dumb Money" poster depicts stacks of cash styled to look like an obscene hand gesture, along with the words "Dear Wall Street." What does Mr. Schwarzman's father think about this? Moreover, what do the businessmen caricatured in the film think?
"I'm very, very curious as to what they'll say," said Thomas E. Rothman, chairman of Sony's motion picture group, which will premiere the R-rated "Dumb Money" on Friday at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I know the movie was meticulously researched." (Translation: Sony's lawyers are ready.)
Stephen Schwarzman declined to comment. So did Mr. Griffin and Mr. Cohen. Mr. Plotkin did not respond to queries.
In 2011, Teddy Schwarzman, 44, founded a film company that has since delivered art house hits like "The Imitation Game," which collected $ 234 million worldwide in 2014 and was nominated for eight Oscars. (The movie won for Graham Moore's screenplay.) In an interview, Mr. Schwarzman insisted he had no particular desire to make Wall Street look bad.
"It's never about my thoughts and my feelings," Mr. Schwarzman said of the films he made. "It's about the material: What is this saying and how effective is it in what it's trying to do? Is this a piece of content that can stand out in the genre that it's in and do something novel and do something special?"
"'Dumb Money' is a comedic and thrilling examination of what's going on in our Main Street versus Wall Street world," he added.
Asked if his father or any other Wall Street figure had reached out to him to complain about "Dumb Money," directly or indirectly, Mr. Schwarzman shook his head no.
Sony, which bought distribution rights to "Dumb Money" from Mr. Schwarzman, plans a slow theatrical rollout for the film starting next Friday. Sony expects "Dumb Money" to play on at least 2,500 screens in the United States and Canada by Sept. 29. A release of that size typically requires a marketing campaign costing more than $ 20 million. (Sony declined to say how much it will spend.)
It's a big gamble. "The Big Short," the 2015 film about the greedy architects of the 2008 financial crisis, rode five Oscar nominations to $ 133 million in global ticket sales. (It cost about $ 28 million to make.) Since then, however, in part because of the pandemic, audiences have grown accustomed to streaming these kinds of films at home, leaving theaters to play mostly big-budget franchise spectacles.
"Originality works in theaters when it has cultural urgency, and there's a tremendous amount in this story that speaks to the particular cultural moment that we're in -- the explosion of discontent," Mr. Rothman, the Sony executive, said.
The cast includes Paul Dano, America Ferrera, Pete Davidson, Anthony Ramos and Shailene Woodley. Normally, a cast like this would translate into promotional appearances in settings like "Saturday Night Live," talk shows and social media platforms.
But Hollywood actors are on strike. Their union has banned publicity efforts for virtually all completed films until the stalemate is resolved, and no talks have been scheduled. (Writers are also on strike, with no end in sight. It is not lost on the screenwriters that "Dumb Money," about a populist uprising, is coming out when they have been walking picket lines.)
Familiarity with the GameStop investing saga or even the basics of high finance is not a prerequisite for watching "Dumb Money." The movie unfolds as a relatively simple David-and-Goliath story -- set to a sometimes profane hip-hop and rock soundtrack, with actual Reddit threads, TikTok memes and TV news footage occasionally peppering the screen in unconventional ways.
"To quote the great Billy Friedkin, we wanted the movie to feel like a bat out of hell," said Ms. Angelo, the co-writer, referring to the famed director, who died last month.
Mr. Gillespie, the director, is known for quirky, comedic films ("Lars and the Real Girl," 2007) with exuberant pacing ("I, Tonya," 2017) that sometimes teeter toward mockumentary. "Dumb Money" was a unique challenge, he said, because the story is told through a large number of characters, many of whom have lives that never intersect.
"We have 12 different characters plus a complicated backdrop," he said. "The priority was always to strip it back and get to the core of the emotion, which is this frustration and outright outrage at the disparity of wealth that's going on in this country."
The GameStop surge was driven, in part, by boredom. Working at home or being unemployed during the pandemic, neophyte investors opened brokerage accounts and got caught up in endless online hype around certain stocks.
Mr. Gillespie's son Miles was one of the them. "He made like 50 times his investment," Mr. Gillespie said of his son's GameStop bet. "He actually timed it perfectly."
Excited, Mr. Gillespie then put money into the company -- just in time for the stock to crash. "My timing was perfectly wrong," he said. Mr. Gillespie declined to say how much he lost. "The point is that I was emotionally invested in this story," he said.
"Dumb Money" got its start in January 2021 when the producer Aaron Ryder ("Arrival") was twiddling his thumbs during a 14-day pandemic quarantine in Canada. He had come across conversations on Reddit about GameStop, and then his phone rang. It was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was owned by Anchorage Capital, a New York investment firm led by Kevin Ulrich. Mr. Ulrich also served as MGM's chairman.
"He thought the GameStop story would make a cool movie," Mr. Ryder recalled.
Mr. Ryder sprang into action. Through a contact, he had heard that Ben Mezrich, who wrote the Facebook origin book that served as source material for the film "The Social Network," was working on a book proposal about the GameStop phenomenon.
"I kind of just begged and pleaded and maybe lied a little bit to try to get a hold of this thing," Mr. Ryder said. He succeeded, and started to put together a creative team, including Ms. Angelo and Ms. Blum, who ultimately based their screenplay on Mr. Mezrich's book "The Antisocial Network: The GameStop Short Squeeze and the Ragtag Group of Amateur Traders That Brought Wall Street to Its Knees."
In spring 2021, however, Anchorage sold MGM to Amazon, and "Dumb Money" was suddenly in limbo. "The project ended up being a bit of an orphan that nobody wanted to own," Mr. Schwarzman said.
At the time, "Dumb Money" was expected to cost as much as $ 40 million to make. Mr. Ryder and Mr. Schwarzman whittled down the budget and secured tax rebates from New Jersey, where much of the 31-day shoot would take place.
Mr. Schwarzman then sold certain distribution rights to Sony for an estimated $ 16 million. His company, Black Bear, sold additional rights to overseas distributors, putting the film on solid financial ground before it even arrives in theaters.
The irony is that Mr. Schwarzman is what Hollywood has long called "dumb money," an affluent, often gullible outsider bitten by the movie bug. But he may get the last laugh. As he told The Wall Street Journal in 2013, for an article about Hollywood-bound heirs to family fortunes, "The idea is for dumb money to be smarter."

Google to Face Blistering Trial Over Its Power: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Justice Department has spent three years over two presidential administrations building the case that Google illegally abused its power over online search to throttle competition. To defend itself, Google has enlisted hundreds of employees and three powerful law firms and spent millions of dollars on legal fees and lobbyists.
On Tuesday, a judge in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will begin considering their arguments at a trial that cuts to the heart of a long-simmering question: Did today's tech giants become dominant by breaking the law?
The case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- is the federal government's first monopoly trial of the modern internet era, as a generation of tech companies has come to wield immense influence over commerce, information, public discourse, entertainment and labor. The trial moves the antitrust battle against those companies to a new phase, shifting from challenging their mergers and acquisitions to more deeply examining the businesses that thrust them into power.
Such a consequential case over tech power has not unfolded since the Justice Department took Microsoft to court in 1998 for antitrust violations. But since then, companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, have woven themselves into people's lives to an even greater degree. Any ruling from the trial could have broad ripple effects, slowing down or potentially dismantling the largest internet companies after decades of unbridled growth.
The stakes are particularly high for Google, the Silicon Valley company founded in 1998, which grew into a $ 1.7 trillion giant by becoming the first place people turned to online to search the web. The government has said in its complaint that it wants Google to change its monopolistic business practices, potentially pay damages and restructure itself.
"This is a pivotal case and a moment to create precedents for these new platforms that lend themselves to real and durable market power," said Laura Phillips-Sawyer, who teaches antitrust law at the University of Georgia School of Law.
The case centers on whether Google illegally cemented its dominance and squashed competition by paying Apple and other companies to make its internet search engine the default on the iPhone as well as on other devices and platforms.
In legal filings, the Justice Department has argued that Google maintained a monopoly through such agreements, making it harder for consumers to use other search engines. Google has said that its deals with Apple and others were not exclusive and that consumers could alter the default settings on their devices to choose alternative search engines.
Google has amassed 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States and 91 percent globally, according to Similarweb, a data analysis firm.
Fireworks are expected at the trial, which is scheduled to last 10 weeks. Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, as well as executives from Apple and other tech companies will probably be called as witnesses.
Judge Amit P. Mehta, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014, is presiding over the trial, which will not have a jury, and he will issue the final ruling. Kenneth Dintzer, a 30-year veteran litigator for the Justice Department, will lead the government's arguments in the courtroom, while John E. Schmidtlein, a partner at the law firm Williams & Connolly, will do the same for Google.
The jockeying over the trial has already been intense. The Justice Department and Google have deposed more than 150 people for the case and produced more than five million pages of documents. Google has argued that Jonathan Kanter, the Justice Department's head of antitrust, is biased because of his earlier work as a private lawyer representing Microsoft and News Corp. The Justice Department has accused Google of destroying employees' instant messages that could have contained relevant information for the case.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in an interview last month that the company's tactics were "completely lawful" and that its success "comes down to the quality of our products."
"It's frustrating -- maybe it's ironic -- that we're seeing this backward-looking case and really unprecedented, forward-looking innovation," he said.
The Justice Department declined to comment.
Google's search engine was created by Sergey Brin and Larry Page when they were students at Stanford University in the 1990s. Their technology was widely praised for serving up more relevant results than other web search tools. Google eventually parlayed that success into new business lines including online advertising, video streaming, maps, office apps, driverless cars and artificial intelligence.
Rivals have long accused Google of brandishing its power in search to suppress competitors' links to travel, restaurant reviews and maps, while giving greater prominence to its own content. Those complaints brought scrutiny from regulators, though little action was taken.
In 2019, under President Donald J. Trump, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission decided to mount new antitrust investigations into tech companies as part of a broad crackdown. The Justice Department agreed to oversee inquiries into Apple and Google.
In October 2020, the government sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search. In its lawsuit, the government accused Google of hurting rivals like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo by employing agreements with Apple and other smartphone makers to become the default search engine on their web browsers or be preinstalled on their devices.
"Two decades ago, Google became the darling of Silicon Valley as a scrappy start-up with an innovative way to search the emerging internet," the Justice Department said in its lawsuit. "That Google is long gone."
Google's actions had harmed consumers and stifled competition, the agency said, and could affect the future technological landscape as the company positioned itself to control "emerging channels" for search distribution. The agency added that Google had behaved similarly to Microsoft in the 1990s, when the software giant made its own web browser the default on the Windows operating system, crushing competitors.
A group of 35 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia also filed a lawsuit in 2020 accusing Google of abusing its monopoly in search and search advertising to illegally wedge out competitors. That case will be tried alongside the Justice Department lawsuit, though Judge Mehta threw out many of the states' key arguments in a ruling last month.
In January, the Justice Department filed a separate antitrust suit against Google, accusing it of abusing its monopoly power in advertising technology. The company faces two other lawsuits from states that accused it of abusing monopolies in ad tech and for blocking competition in its Google Play app store. Google and the states said in a Tuesday night court filing that they had reached an "agreement in principle" to settle the case.
For decades, judges have generally ruled against companies in antitrust cases only when their conduct hurts consumers, particularly if they have raised prices. Critics have said that lets companies like Google -- which provides internet search for free -- off the hook.
Google's Mr. Walker said the case was a moment for the court to double down on that standard.
"American law should be about promoting benefits for consumers," he said, adding: "If we move away from that and make it harder for companies to provide great goods and services for consumers, that's going to be bad for everyone."
Monopoly trials can change the direction of industries. In 1984, under pressure from the Justice Department, AT&T split itself into seven regional telecom companies. The breakup transformed the telecommunications industry by making it more competitive at the dawn of the mobile phone era.
But the effects of the government's antitrust battle with Microsoft in the early 2000s were less clear cut. The two sides eventually settled after Microsoft agreed to end certain contracts with PC makers that blocked rival software makers.
Some tech executives said the Justice Department's actions made Microsoft more cautious, clearing the way for start-ups like Google to compete in the next era of computing. Bill Gates, a Microsoft founder, has blamed the hangover from the antitrust suit for the company's slow entry into mobile technology and the failure of its Windows phone. But others have argued that the settlement did little to increase competition.
Ultimately, the Google trial will test whether antitrust laws written in 1890 to break up sugar, steel and railroad monopolies can still work in today's economy, said Rebecca Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt University's law school.
"The Google trial is a big test for the government's entire antitrust agenda because its theory of monopolization is very much in play with many big tech companies," she said.

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has spent three years over two presidential administrations building the case that Google illegally abused its power over online search to throttle competition.

On Tuesday, a judge in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will begin considering their arguments at a trial that cuts to the heart of a long-simmering question: Did today’s tech giants become dominant by breaking the law?

Bringing Back the Sounds of 'Kids': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Lou Barlow and John Davis made tracks for the 1995 cultural flashpoint. They split after a 1999 LP, but reunited during the pandemic, and made plans to release more songs.
By the early 1990s, Lou Barlow was used to getting some weird fan mail. The lyrics he wrote for his band Sebadoh seemed to excavate the loneliest and weirdest secrets of his inner world -- subject matter that invited Barlow's listeners to form an unusually close relationship to its singer. He didn't think much of it when one of those fans, a teenager named Harmony Korine, sent him the full-length script for a pretty out-there movie he'd written called "Kids."
"It seemed kind of extreme, but I was used to it," Barlow recalled in a video interview. He began corresponding with Korine, who wanted Barlow to write the music for his film, which was not some pipe dream but actually in an early state of production. Korine, he said, had a clear vision: "He obviously knew what he was talking about."
Directed by the photographer Larry Clark, "Kids" would indeed become a cultural flashpoint upon its 1995 release for its colorful, and arguably exploitative, depiction of wayward New York City teenagers caught up in drugs and sex. It would serve as a launching pad for Korine's own directorial ambitions, and the careers of the actresses Chloë Sevigny and Rosario Dawson. And for many viewers, the "Kids" soundtrack was an introduction to some of the stranger artists in then-contemporary American independent music: the outsider singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston; the mysterious post-rock practitioners Slint; and the Folk Implosion, Barlow's eclectic band with John Davis, who ended up scoring a good chunk of the movie.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An incomplete version of that soundtrack is available on some streaming platforms, but it cannot be heard as it was initially presented. (Multiple songs -- different ones -- are missing on Apple Music and Spotify; the LP isn't on Tidal or Amazon Music.) A Domino publicist said in an email that Universal -- the parent company of London Records, which first released the "Kids" soundtrack -- no longer held the rights to any of the music, and that "a partial selection had become available erroneously."
But now, the Folk Implosion's contributions to that soundtrack will be reissued on Sept. 8 via Domino Records as "Music for Kids." It contains all the original compositions the band made for the movie, many of which have never been available on streaming, as well as a grab bag of sonically similar Folk Implosion recordings from subsequent albums. "Music for Kids" also doubles as a flagship release for the duo's reunion. Davis left the band in 1999 on unfavorable terms; today, they're working on new Folk Implosion recordings, and making plans to perform together.
"There's a core spark to it that feels almost genetic," Davis said in a separate video interview.
Their collaboration as the Folk Implosion was, in fact, inspired by a fan letter that a teenage Davis wrote to Barlow in the late '80s, when Barlow was living in Westfield, Mass. At the time, Barlow was beginning to gain attention for his work in Sebadoh, following his stint as the bassist in the alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr. His experience with the indie music scene had made him acutely aware of its limitations, and in Davis, he found a cerebral collaborator who wasn't afraid to talk freely about the creative process.
"John, he's an actual intellectual," Barlow said. "Him being a fan of my work really made me feel safe -- that I could just start talking."
Their mutual openness led the Folk Implosion in a very different direction. Contrary to Dinosaur Jr.'s grungy guitar heroics, or Sebadoh's homespun singer-songwriter recordings, Davis was more comfortable pushing Barlow to experiment with rap and R&B production methods. Most of their songs originated as drum and bass compositions before they layered in samples, loops and nontraditional instrumentation.
"We were trying to poke fun at the pieties of this very white indie-rock world, and be open to other influences," Davis said. He described a dynamic in the underground scene where white musicians, fearing accusations of cultural appropriation, stayed away from historically Black genres altogether. The Folk Implosion was inspired by groups like Devo and Public Image Ltd., who freely combined disparate styles into their own creations. As Barlow put it, "we really felt like everything should be melded together."
Following a whirlwind trip to New York City, where Barlow got a firsthand look at the particular method of Korine and Clark's madness, he and Davis convened at Boston's Fort Apache Studios to work on the soundtrack. As the movie was being completed, they were mailed VHS tapes of scenes. The percussively frantic "Nasa Theme" was written for when Sevigny's character, Jenny, ventures to N.A.S.A., an all-ages dance party at the once-thriving Club Shelter. The jaunty "Cabride" was meant to accompany Jenny as she rides in a taxi cab after learning she has tested positive for H.I.V.
Not all of these compositions made it into the film: "Cabride" was cut in favor of a jazz song that Clark preferred. Others, like the haunting "Raise the Bells," which plays over a lonesome montage of early morning New York City, were pulled right from Barlow's existing discography. "A lot of things they chose to actually put in the movie, we recorded on a four-track at my house," Davis noted, including the melancholy yet ascendant "Jenny's Theme," which appeared multiple times in the film.
But the two never seemed to encounter much resistance as they worked on the soundtrack, which they made without a restrictive budget. (They were paid a flat fee: "I know our lawyer thought it was low, whatever it was," the band wrote in an email.) The lack of guardrails led to its biggest single, "Natural One." Conceived for a scene where a group of teenage girls talk frankly about their sex lives, the song was ultimately left out of the final cut. (In its place, Korine inserted a Beastie Boys track.) Nonetheless, the Folk Implosion refused to consign it to the archives.
"We didn't know it would be popular, but we knew that we'd done something very good," Davis said. After the movie was finished, they received some extra money from London Records that allowed them to add vocals and complete the song. Upon its release and promotion, "Natural One" reached an unlikely position of No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100.
The surprise hit invited plenty of attention from curious labels, appropriate in a post-Nirvana era when plenty of big-money contracts were handed out to underground acts. The Folk Implosion signed with Interscope, but the ride wouldn't last long. Barlow found himself in the untenable position of having to reassure his Sebadoh bandmates that his attentions weren't divided, which became increasingly difficult.
"For all the success I was having, I still had a pretty remarkable lack of confidence," he said. And Davis became conflicted about participating in mainstream entertainment, which exacerbated his own anxiety about becoming a public figure.
Slowly, their relationship started to fray. Davis ended up quitting the band after the release of "One Part Lullaby" in 1999, their only record for Interscope. They would not speak for over 20 years. But near the start of the pandemic, they became Facebook friends. "I started thinking to myself, 'What if Lou died, and we never talked to each other again?"' Davis said. After a handful of online interactions, they reconnected over the phone, where they hashed out some of those longstanding issues. They raised the possibility of collaborating again, which led to the "Kids" reissue and their upcoming plans for the Folk Implosion.
In a joint interview, they displayed a lively and easygoing dynamic: lots of laughter, lots of smiles. Davis was a very deliberate and politically conscientious speaker on his own -- he made frequent reference to writers such as bell hooks and Imani Perry -- but he appeared lighter in Barlow's company. The two freely completed each other's thoughts, and made instant reference to what the other was more likely to remember about the past.
"It's virtually the same," Barlow said, of their resumed friendship. As Davis listened on, he explained he was "happy to change the ending" of what had been a sad conclusion to an otherwise fruitful experience.
"I don't think anything's actually finished until we're gone," he said. "I would like to think of us in terms of folk or jazz musicians -- people who keep playing music until they dropped dead." Working with Davis again, he said, had reminded him of the excitement of their initial collaboration. "I could never predict where those songs would end up," he said. Now, as their new songs have taken shape, "they always surprise me."

On the Hunt in a Mosquito Paradise: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a damp, dungeonlike cell beneath a crumbling military fortress in northeast Queens, Dr. Waheed Bajwa and his team were counting sleeping mosquitoes and trying to divine the future.
Soon the mosquitoes would awaken and secrete rafts of goo into puddles of standing water and lay hundreds of eggs onto them that would hatch into larvae that would feed and grow up and mate and lay eggs of their own -- until sometime in late summer one of their great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaughters would bite a sparrow infected with West Nile virus and then, perhaps, a human.
But that day was months off. On this balmy morning in mid-February, Dr. Bajwa, a mild-mannered, methodical, relentless medical entomologist who has spent 21 years heading the city Health Department's Office of Vector Surveillance and Control, was hoping to find signs that the coming summer would be merciful.
Last year saw the highest number of human West Nile cases since 1999, when the virus first appeared in the Western Hemisphere in Queens and killed four New Yorkers.
Now, in the city's 25th year living with the virus, Dr. Bajwa was chasing the goal he had never achieved: to make it through an entire New York summer without a single human case of West Nile.
Dr. Bajwa's war against mosquitoes and West Nile is waged by air and ground, from the swamps of Staten Island to the manholes of the Upper West Side. His weapons include dry ice and bacteria-impregnated corncob granules, fermented rabbit chow, copper BB pellets and a device called a Multi-Tube Vortexer.
In the dripping cell in Queens, Dr. Bajwa pointed a flashlight at the 300 mosquitoes clinging to the ceiling of Entrance 1, Room 3 of the city's official mosquito hibernaculum and pronounced the early results encouraging: "If we would have come last year, there would be thousands actually in one single room."
New York City, with its 5,600 acres of wetlands, 150,000 storm drains and miles of ancient sewer tunnel, is a sprawling mosquito paradise. It is home to 47 species of Culicidae, including two that were first recorded in the United States in Dr. Bajwa's 2018 study, "A Taxonomic Checklist and Relative Abundance of the Mosquitoes of New York City." The paper revealed that 21 new species had taken up residence here since the last survey in the 1930s.
There are bluish mosquitoes, golden mosquitoes, striped mosquitoes, spotted mosquitoes, mosquitoes with apt species names like Aedes excrucians and Aedes vexans. But none preoccupy Dr. Bajwa, 64, as much as the most common species, Culex pipiens, the northern house mosquito -- the biggest source of West Nile infection in New York.
West Nile is typically transmitted to humans this way: A bird that has the virus is bitten by a mosquito. Then the mosquito, now a carrier, bites a human.
In some parts of the country, house mosquitoes feed primarily on birds. But the New York City version is a hybrid between a subterranean strain, which developed a taste for mammalian blood from sewer rats, and the more common aboveground version that prefers birds. This makes it a perfect "bridge vector" -- an agent that spreads disease from one species to another.
Last year, Dr. Bajwa believes, a new strain of West Nile emerged that birds had not had time to build immunity to, so more birds contracted the virus. The infected birds passed the strain to city mosquitoes, who passed it on to 46 humans, more than double the typical number. Two people died.
West Nile has killed 59 people in New York City over the years. More than 400 people have contracted West Nile neuroinvasive disease; its symptoms include brain inflammation, paralysis and permanent nerve damage. The city estimates that there have been 12,000 undiagnosed cases of West Nile fever.
The mosquito campaign begins each winter in the Queens hibernaculum, a warren of nine dismal rooms beneath a 120-year-old gun battery at Fort Totten Park that disuse has transformed into a laboratory: Each room has different light, temperature and humidity conditions, making the fortress an ideal place to observe and model winter survivorship rates and allowing the city to get a jump on forecasting the coming season. Some hibernating mosquitoes turn out to have West Nile hibernating inside them.
The battle reaches its fiercest stage in late August, when the infection rate in mosquitoes peaks and the most human cases develop. Trucks sweep through residential neighborhoods spraying pesticide.
There has never been a year with fewer than three human cases. If the city lets up the pressure, Dr. Bajwa said, "the number of cases is going to go very high."
'They look beautiful'
Dr. Bajwa discovered the joys of entomology growing up in Pakistan, where his father, the agriculture director in the mountainous province of Azad Kashmir, took him to the lab and on nature walks. His first insect loves were dragonflies and butterflies, but he has grown to admire mosquitoes, even though his job requires that he slaughter them by the millions.
"If you look at them under the microscope, oh, they look beautiful -- I will show you!" Dr. Bajwa said. "Their antennas. Their eyes, their compound eyes, their mouthparts."
Some are particularly striking. Under a microscope, Psorophora ferox, the white-footed woods mosquito, found occasionally on Staten Island, is a riot of iridescent color, purple and green and gold, as if it had been showered with pixie dust.
Dr. Bajwa is particularly fond of the elephant mosquito, Toxorhynchites rutilus, one of the largest species in the United States, half an inch long, with dapper, blue-speckled legs. "Those are a favorite because they feed on other mosquitoes," he said.
In late spring, the city starts bombing breeding grounds with larvicide -- ground-up corncobs saturated with naturally occurring soil bacteria that are deadly to baby mosquitoes but generally harmless to other life.
Dr. Bajwa oversaw the operation at Freshkills Park on Staten Island, a savannah of gentle hills laid atop what was once the world's largest landfill. It was June 8. A helicopter roared in, refilled with pesticide, took off again. The pilot, John Sondgeroth, a Vietnam combat vet, flew low over Fresh Kills creek, strafing the waterline, targeting the roots of marsh grass where another species that carries West Nile shelters and feeds.
'Just like mowing the lawn'
"Just like mowing the lawn," Mr. Sondgeroth said. "You go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
The Health Department conducts larviciding citywide near the start of the season to cut the overall population. It limits its spraying for adult mosquitoes, which involves less environmentally benign chemicals, to neighborhoods where virus activity is high, later in summer. Mosquitoes grow up fast, progressing from larva to expectant mom hungry for blood in a couple of weeks.
Near Freshkills, Dr. Bajwa led a brief side expedition to a marshy thicket across from an Amazon warehouse, one of more than 400 spots where the Health Department sets mosquito traps. His assistant director for vector surveillance, Kamesan Kanapathipillai, ducked behind a tree and emerged with an apparatus that looked like a homemade lamp attached to a tray of slimy liquid.
This was a trap for pregnant mosquitoes. The lure was a slosh of water into which rabbit-food pellets are dissolved and left to rot, simulating the puddles and ponds rich in decaying plant matter where mosquitoes lay their eggs.
A fan mounted above the water sucked the mosquitoes -- there were hundreds -- into a mesh cage. Mr. Kanapathipillai transferred them to a cooler of dry ice, killing the mosquitoes while keeping any virus inside them alive.
The mosquitoes would be tested in the city's public health lab, in groups of 50, known as pools. In a typical year, about 700 mosquito pools test positive for West Nile, out of about 5,000. Last year the city found 1,555 positive pools, the most it has ever recorded.
Your chances of getting West Nile depend on where you live, because different species dominate different neighborhoods. The common house mosquito is found in a crescent stretching from eastern Queens to southern Brooklyn to the east tip of Staten Island. Staten Island is also thick with unbanded salt marsh mosquitoes.
Then there is Dubos Point Wildlife Sanctuary, a mosquito playground in Far Rockaway, jutting into Jamaica Bay, where the Health Department is not allowed to spray. It is the domain of the black salt marsh mosquito. They do not carry West Nile but are terrifying nonetheless. At Dubos Point, Dr. Bajwa's vector surveillers set their traps and run.
"You can't get away," Mr. Kanapathipillai said. "Your face, up your nose, your mouth, your ears." A single trap set in Dubos can capture 5,000 mosquitoes in 24 hours.
A field trip to the sanctuary confirmed that life there is wild indeed. On the trail that skirts the marsh grass, a dense cloud of bloodlust envelops the visitor. Hundreds of tiny needles penetrate all exposed flesh.
'Weak fliers'
I had let Dr. Bajwa know that I planned to head out to Dubos Point. He emailed me that afternoon: "I just wanted to reach out and inquire about your experience in the Dubos Point marshland. While I trust that your time in the marshland was enjoyable, I wanted to take a moment to address any potential challenges or unexpected situations that may have arisen during your trip."
I mentioned that I got bit dozens of times in a matter of minutes. Dr. Bajwa, whose personal mosquito control plan includes wearing long sleeves even on the hottest days of midsummer, sent a link to the CDC's mosquito bite symptom and treatment page. "Thank you once again for sharing your experience," he wrote. "If you have any further questions or need additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out."
He has his own method of dealing with mosquitoes. "When I find myself relaxing in my backyard, I always set up a pedestal fan," he wrote. "Mosquitoes happen to be weak fliers, unable to contend with even a gentle breeze." When he does get bitten, he added, "I make a conscious effort not to give in to the temptation of scratching."
The Office of Vector Surveillance and Control is quartered on the 11th floor of the city's Public Health Laboratory, a drab bastion of bureaucracy on First Avenue in Manhattan.
Each weekday in the summer, the contents of dozens of traps around the city are brought in to the office and processed. During a two-day period in July, Mr. Kanapathipillai and a colleague, Hazel Paul, sitting at their microscopes, identified and logged 26,000 individual mosquitoes.
After the species that carry West Nile are sorted into tubes of 50, two BB-gun pellets are placed in each tube. The tubes are sent down to the testing lab on the ninth floor where they are agitated in the Vortexer, a high-speed mixer, until the mosquitoes are pulverized. Then they are centrifuged to extract any West Nile RNA.
The office, which has an annual budget of $ 4 million, was created in 2001 as part of the city's response to West Nile. The disease was first identified here after an 80-year-old man in northern Queens died in late August of 1999 of what was initially misdiagnosed as St. Louis encephalitis.
Within two months, 44 people had been hospitalized, and three more were dead. The city's mosquito control apparatus, which Dr. Bajwa said had been largely dormant since the 1970s, was resurrected. There was considerable public alarm. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani held frequent news conferences to announce setbacks and advances in the fight. When Central Park closed overnight for spraying after the virus was found there, it was front-page news.
'A lethal disease'
A large-scale epidemic never happened, which Dr. Bajwa attributes to the city's aggressive tactics and speedy testing operation.
"Within 24 hours, we are able to figure out where the virus is circulating in the city of New York, and we immediately we go there and we start doing larviciding," he said.
Dr. Bajwa urged against complacency at all costs. "West Nile virus is a lethal disease," he said.
On Aug. 3, Dr. Bajwa stood in the parking lot of Baisley Pond Park in southeast Queens, a mile from Kennedy Airport. No human case had been recorded in the city, but it was early, and the results from the mosquito traps were concerning.
"We have a very high level of West Nile virus in this area," he said gravely.
It was just before sunset. The park was emptying out, but the parking lot was filling up with Health Department pickup trucks. Mounted in the bed of each was a Grizzly Ultra Low Volume Fogger Sprayer.
The city sprays residential neighborhoods with Anvil pesticide, which can irritate people's respiratory systems and harm aquatic life, only as a last resort, Dr. Bajwa said. But the park and the area around it met the threshold: positive pools at numerous locations and several weeks of "persistent positivity." (A city environmental impact study in 2001 found the effect of pesticide minimal compared with the risk from West Nile.)
As the trucks set out, loudspeakers mounted on escort cars blared a warning: "To minimize exposure to the pesticide, please go indoors immediately until the trucks have passed."
Luke Howell, a veteran exterminator, flipped a switch by the dashboard of his truck.
"OK, I'm flowing," he said. A plume of fog issued from the sprayer. Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The truck crept past silent lawns and driveways. Up 121st Avenue. Down 217th Street. As Mr. Howell approached a couple standing by their car, he turned off the sprayer. The couple pulled their T-shirts up over their noses. Mr. Howell passed by and turned the spray back on.
The trucks would be out until 2 or 4 a.m. Dr. Bajwa went home to sit at his computer and wait for a possible call. "I'm home, but I don't sleep," he said. The next day would be busy: "I have been told by our public health laboratory that we have 78 new positive reports."
The streak continued: more positive pools -- the count passed 500 -- but no human cases.
In the fourth week of August, bad news trickled in.
Two people in Queens had contracted West Nile. So had someone in Manhattan. By Aug. 28 there were half a dozen cases.
Dr. Bajwa had known a year without any human cases was an elusive goal. "The chances for that to happen are very low," he said.
In his office on First Avenue, Dr. Bajwa studied maps and sifted data. There were more traps to set, more neighborhoods to spray. The distant descendants of February's mosquitoes were thick in the air, and the season still had two months to go.

Why a Swift Coup Caught Gabon's Leader Off-Guard: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hailed as a climate visionary, Gabon's president, Ali Bongo Ondimba, was once welcomed to Buckingham Palace but was blindsided by this week's coup.
As the all-powerful ruler of oil-rich Gabon, Ali Bongo Ondimba had two passions, music and forests, that forged powerful ties across the world.
An accomplished musician, Mr. Bongo recorded a disco-funk album and lured James Brown and Michael Jackson to Gabon. As president, he built a music studio at his seaside palace and played improv jazz to foreign diplomats at state dinners.
More recently, Mr. Bongo allied with Western scientists and conservationists, entranced by both the paradisiacal beauty of Gabon, an Arizona-sized country covered in lush rainforest and teeming with wildlife, and by his commitment to protecting it.
But to his own people, Mr. Bongo, 64, embodied a family dynasty, founded by his father, which had dominated Gabon for 56 years -- until this week, when it came crashing down.
Military officers seized power on Wednesday, hours after election officials declared Mr. Bongo the winner of a disputed election last weekend. Few saw it coming, not least the president. When his own guards came for him, Mr. Bongo seemed genuinely bewildered.
"I don't know what's going on," Mr. Bongo, speaking from his home, said in a video that was authenticated and circulated by some of his many Western advisers. "I'm calling on you to make noise."
It was the latest in a blaze of military takeovers of African countries, toppling weak governments. ("Déjà coup," said one analyst from Sudan, which had its own coup in 2021.) But while other takeovers were prompted by violent upheaval, in peaceful Gabon it was something else: A sign that the Bongo rule, which held fast for a half-century, had run its course.
There was no sign of Mr. Bongo on Thursday, a day after his plaintive cry for help. The coup leader Gen. Brice Oligui Nguema -- a cousin of Mr. Bongo -- announced he would be sworn in as "transitional president" next Monday.
Other African leaders, fearing they might be next, took precautions. In neighboring Cameroon, President Paul Biya -- in office for 40 years and, at age 90, the world's oldest serving leader -- announced a sudden reshuffle of his country's military leadership. So, too, did Rwanda, which like Gabon has for decades been ruled by one man.
As Mr. Bongo's fate hung in the balance, reactions differed. Foreign conservationists expressed worries about what comes next for a country that worked so hard to preserve its pristine forests and seas. Recently, Gabon negotiated a landmark $ 500 million debt refinancing deal that freed $ 163 million for marine protection.
"A power vacuum could lead to a free-for-all where poaching, illegal logging and deforestation increase," said Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London, who has advised Gabon on climate policy. "The prospect of the Gabonese people gaining major income from their forests could evaporate."
In Libreville, Gabon's crowded seaside capital, the verdict was more mixed. "I am free!" cried Alaphine, a young woman in a crowd of coup supporters who declined to give a surname. But Christopher Ngondjet, a 25-year-old law student, said he felt torn.
He welcomed a change from the Bongos, he said, but worried about military rule. "The president did a lot of good things, especially with the environment," he said. "I don't know if the generals will have the same interest."
In many ways, Gabon has more in common with some Persian Gulf states than with its African neighbors. It has a tiny population of 2.3 million people, huge oil wealth and a country that is sparsely inhabited; 88 percent of the land is forest and roads are few.
As oil prices soared in the last quarter of the 20th century, the Bongo family reigned like an undeclared monarchy. President Omar Bongo took power in 1967 and became a close ally of France, Gabon's former colonial ruler. By most estimates, he fathered at least 53 children with different women, a means of cementing political alliances.
After Omar Bongo died in 2009, the torch passed to Ali, one of his seven "official" sons, who won the presidential election that year.
The Bongos loved the baubles of super wealth -- the Bentleys, the Parisian villas, the vacations on the Côte d'Azur. Ali Bongo frequently rode around Libreville in a Rolls-Royce and socialized with King Mohammed of Morocco, an old friend who has a private palace in Gabon.
French investigators accused Mr. Bongo and his family of corruption. But what distinguished their country from nearby oil-rich kleptocracies, like Equatorial Guinea, was that some wealth also flowed down.
Education and health care levels are significantly higher in Gabon than elsewhere in the region. Gifted students are sent to France on government scholarships. Its timber industry provides 30,000 jobs, largely thanks to Mr. Bongo's insistence that value be added in Gabon, not abroad.
With its orderly markets and palm-lined corniche, Libreville lacks the constant chaos of neighboring capitals. The U.S. Agency for International Development classifies Gabon as a middle-income country.
Certainly, poverty is rife: a report by McKinsey in 2013 estimated that 30 percent of Gabonese lived on $ 140 a month. Yet even in the poorest parts of Libreville living conditions are better than in much of the region.
Mr. Bongo's kitchen cabinet is filled with Western advisers who stroll through government offices and in one case was appointed a minister: Lee White, a British-born scientist, who since 2019 has been minister of water, forests, the sea and environment.
About 15 years ago, Mr. Bongo began focusing on the country's forests -- home to western lowland gorillas, forest elephants, chimps and mandrills, and part of the Congo Basin, one of the world's most important carbon sinks.
Omar Bongo, created 13 national parks covering 10 percent of Gabon's landmass, and Ali Bongo continued that passion. He flew by helicopter to his private reserve, where he kept lions, tigers, cheetahs, cougars and leopards.
He became a regular at international climate conferences, and courted powerful, wealthy allies. Last year King Charles, who has praised Mr. Bongo's policies, welcomed him to Buckingham Palace. On a visit to Gabon, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, pledged $ 35 million for forest preservation.
Mr. Bongo's advocacy was partly driven by self-interest. It burnished his foreign image and opened doors to a potential fortune in carbon credits -- billions of dollars that Mr. Bongo has urged the West to pay Gabon to help preserve its rainforests.
But foreign officials who met Mr. Bongo said his soft-spoken, genteel manner could vanish as he enthused about nature. In a 2016 interview with the Times, Mr. Bongo reminisced about growing up with a pet Siberian tiger and gushed over his current pets in the presidential reserve. "There are so many," he said, ticking off the names of some of his lions, Goliath and Greta, and a cheetah called Sahara.
But Mr. Bongo's system began to show cracks. After the financial crash of 2008, a fall in oil prices hit Gabon hard. As the economy slumped, inequality grew more pronounced.
The fleets of Mercedes and Rolls-Royce cars that rolled through the small streets of the capital, parking at fancy seafood restaurants or outside the president's palace, began to jar more than usual.
In forest communities, farmers complained that growing numbers of hungry elephants -- a direct result of Mr. Bongo's anti-poaching efforts -- were eating their crops. Despite oil revenues, they complained, passable roads barely existed outside the capital. "Let the elephants vote for him," was a slogan of critics during the 2016 election.
In that vote, Mr. Bongo bared his knuckles to stay in power. In his strongholds, voter turnout was an improbable 99 percent. Security forces encircled the opposition party headquarters and at least one person was killed.
Daniel Mengara, founder of the exiled opposition group Bongo Must Go, said oil revenues did help Gabon's people, but the Bongos skimmed off too much. "We deserve better than what we've got and what we've got is misery," he said.
In 2019 Mr. Bongo suffered a stroke and disappeared for 10 months, re-emerging with a cane. His relationship with France faltered: He welcomed Chinese and other investment, and last year Gabon joined the British Commonwealth.
Since 2020, a series of coups has shaken West Africa: first in Mali, then Burkina Faso, Guinea, Sudan and, last month, Niger. Despite threats and sanctions from African and Western powers, none was reversed.
President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria warned of a "contagion of autocracy," with emboldened soldiers in other countries deciding they should take over, too.
Few imagined Mr. Bongo was in immediate danger. But then he pushed ahead with a contentious election, and the coup makers, led by his own cousin, brought contagion to his door.

Full text: Many of the birds that spend their summers in the United States are preparing to fly south. Here's where they're headed -- and why it matters.
Many of the birds that spend their summers in the United States are preparing to fly south. Here's where they're headed -- and why it matters.
America's birds are in trouble. Since 1970, nearly 3 billion birds have vanished from the skies over North America.
Most of those losses have been in migratory species, which may breed in the United States or Canada in the summer before heading elsewhere for the winter. Many spend more time living on Caribbean beaches or in Costa Rican forests than they do in American backyards. "They're really visitors to North America," said Viviana Ruiz-Gutierrez, co-director of the Center for Avian Population Studies at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.
Protecting these birds will require working across international borders and safeguarding all of their habitats, many of which are under threat. If migrating birds lose their winter refuges, the consequences will ripple across the hemisphere.
"If we lose Central America's forests, we can lose North America's birds," said Jeremy Radachowsky, the director for Mesoamerica and the western Caribbean at the Wildlife Conservation Society.
To illuminate these connections, scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology developed "shared stewardship" maps in collaboration with Partners in Flight, an international bird conservation network. Each map displays the key wintering grounds for the migratory species that have a significant summer presence in a particular U.S. state or region. The maps are based on data from eBird, a database of observations from bird watchers around the world.
Here are some of those connections.
The New York City Metro Area
Many of New York City's avian tourists summer on the shore and then migrate to winter habitats along the coasts of the southern United States or the Caribbean. Numerous shorebird populations have declined steeply in recent years, and they face threats throughout the entire migratory cycle.
"There's very little land along coasts that is free of disturbance or pollution of one kind or another," said Ken Rosenberg, a conservation scientist who recently retired from the Cornell lab and helped create Partners in Flight. "Shorebirds are very vulnerable to that kind of disturbance."
The petite, plump piping plover has been the focus of conservation efforts along its East Coast breeding grounds, including in New York City. But about one-third of the Atlantic population spends the winter in the Bahamas, where many of the birds tend to congregate in just a few locations, scientists have found. "What that means is by doing work in those areas, you can make a large difference on the conservation of that species," said Deb Hahn, the international relations director at the Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies.
The association coordinates Southern Wings, which helps state fish and wildlife agencies connect with conservation groups working in the places where their bird populations winter. Through Southern Wings, 41 state agencies have donated nearly $ 3.6 million to projects in 11 countries, including to piping plover projects in the Bahamas, according to the association.
The New York metro area is also home to many forest-dwelling songbirds. The wood thrush, whose heralded song is often said to sound like a flute, breeds throughout the eastern United States, but its population has plummeted over the last half century. In the fall, many wood thrushes head to the Maya Forest, which spans Mexico, Guatemala and Belize and is one of five major swaths of intact forest remaining in Central America.
"Some migratory species, including some that are in pretty steep decline, are hugely dependent on only these 'five great forests,"' said Anna Lello-Smith, the avian conservation coordinator for Mesoamerica and the western Caribbean at the Wildlife Conservation Society.
But cattle ranching, much of it illegal, has resulted in significant deforestation, she said. The Wildlife Conservation Society is now working with a coalition of Central American governments and other organizations, such as the Mesoamerican Alliance for People and Forests, to protect these habitats as part of the Five Great Forests Initiative.
Missouri
Missouri provides breeding habitats for many grassland bird species, which have been faring especially poorly in recent decades. Many spend the winter in the southeastern United States, but others find their way to South America.
The dickcissel, a yellow-breasted songbird, winters in Venezuela, while the striking bobolink -- males sport black and white feathers during the breeding season -- journeys as far as Argentina, one of the longest migrations for a songbird. Both species, which sometimes feed on crops, have been targeted for being pests. Human development and the expansion of farming also pose risks to grassland species, as does the mowing of fields, where many birds build their nests.
Missouri also hosts many forest birds, which may migrate to Cuba, Central America's five great forests or the slopes of South America's Andes Mountains. The cerulean warbler, which can be found breeding in the Appalachian Mountains or the Ozarks, relies on forests in the Andes, which have also been threatened by agriculture and other human activities.
"We can't ignore the threats that these birds are facing when they're beyond our borders," said Sarah Kendrick, a migratory bird biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a former state ornithologist for the Missouri Department of Conservation.
SELVA, a conservation nonprofit based in Colombia, has been working to learn more about the cerulean warbler's movements and survival during its time in South America; several Missouri birding groups donated funds to these recent tracking efforts. Through the Neotropical Flyways Project, SELVA and its partners have also identified a site in the Caribbean foothills of Costa Rica that serves as an important refueling site for migrating cerulean warblers. Tree planting and landowner engagement efforts are now underway there. "We have been able to implement conservation recommendations almost immediately," said Nick Bayly, SELVA's director of migratory ecology. "That's been really exciting."
Colorado
Colorado hosts breeding populations of many Great Plains and Western species, such as the Swainson's hawk, whose migration is something of a natural spectacle. The raptors travel to the grasslands of Argentina, soaring on currents of warm air in flocks that can contain thousands of birds.
But many Colorado species make much shorter trips, hopping down to Mexico for the winter. That includes the mountain plover, a grassland bird whose tawny-colored coat provides such good camouflage that it has been called the "prairie ghost." Some of the birds, which are listed as near threatened, winter in the arid grasslands of Northern Mexico. (Others stay stateside, waiting out winter in Texas or California.)
Climate change, overgrazing by local livestock and the expansion of farming all threaten these grasslands, which provide winter habitats for many Great Plains birds. A variety of Mexican nonprofits, community groups and universities are working to monitor, restore and protect these grasslands, often in partnership with U.S.-based groups, such as the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.
Colorado's cliffs and caves also provide homes for one of the most mysterious migrating birds: the black swift, which sometimes breeds behind waterfalls. In the fall, some of the birds seem to fly, nonstop, to the Amazon. But black swifts are spotted so rarely in their wintering grounds that the Cornell team cannot include the birds on its stewardship maps. "There's no birders that see them there," said Andrew Stillman, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. "It's very likely that they just don't land during the winter."
California
Hundreds of West Coast species migrate along what is known as the Pacific Flyway, which stretches from Alaska to the tip of South America. Many venture no farther than Mexico, where they tend to stay closer to the Pacific Coast than many of Colorado's bird species do, said Archie Jiang, a research technician at the Cornell lab.
For instance, the mangrove swamps of the Marismas Nacionales, where conservation efforts are underway, are a popular destination for shorebirds and waterfowl. And many hermit warblers, which breed in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains, spend winter in Mexico's pine-oak forests. "This is a classic Pacific Northwest to west Mexico species," Mr. Jiang said.
But some elegant terns -- anchovy-loving seabirds that nest in large colonies -- fly all the way down to Chile.
Then there is Wilson's phalarope, an unusual shorebird that often lives inland, despite a predilection for salt water. The birds breed at marshes and wetlands across the Western United States and Canada. Then, many of them assemble at Utah's Great Salt Lake before flying off to the salt lakes of the high Andes.
How to Help
These maps are just a snapshot of the migratory connections that exist across the hemisphere, and experts highlighted many more species, habitats and conservation projects worthy of attention. There is no single pattern that describes the migratory behavior of birds in California or New York, and protecting these birds will require efforts that are as diverse and far-flung as their habitats.
"All these birds have figured out different ways of doing this big thing called migration," Dr. Stillman said. "It reflects many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. And it's neat to see how different birds have arrived at different answers."
The Cornell lab is making the shared stewardship maps available to state agencies in hopes of helping them determine where they might want to invest in research and conservation. But the scientists also hope that the maps will help the public understand that our migratory birds are shared -- as is the responsibility for protecting them.
American bird-lovers can help by supporting conservation efforts abroad, through donations, responsible bird-watching tours or the purchase of "bird-friendly" coffee, which is grown without pesticides on farms that maintain healthy habitats for birds. "It's critical for the general public to be aware of the choices that they make and how they can actually have a positive impact somewhere else," said Camila Gómez, director of education and training at SELVA.
We can also become better hosts of these birds while they are in our own backyards. Simple but helpful steps include treating windows to prevent birds from colliding with buildings, keeping cats indoors and planting native greenery, experts said.
"None of us alone can do it," Dr. Ruiz-Gutierrez said. It is the local, on-the-ground conservation efforts in Central and South America that results in many Americans seeing birds in their backyards in the spring, she added. "And then whatever you do that summer results in them seeing birds returned back in the fall," she said." And it's really that connection that's important."

Infusing Louisville With the Distinct Flavor of Havana: [Correction]

Full text: The New Little Havana: Why Cuban Migrants Are Moving to Kentucky
We're exploring how America defines itself one place at a time. In Louisville, Ky., an influx of Cuban immigrants is offsetting a local population decline and bringing new rhythms to the city.
At the first beats of "La Vida es un Carnaval" on a recent morning, several octogenarians in a senior center abandoned their dominoes, coloring books and crossword puzzles, and showed off their salsa moves. Arthritis be damned. The hypnotic music of their homeland still made life a carnival.
Nearby, at a ballet studio, little girls and boys in T-shirts inscribed with, "Que Siga La Tradicion," or "Keep the Tradition Alive," clapped as they shuffled forward and back to a pulsating Afro-Cuban rhythm. "Uno, dos, tres," said their instructor, Selen Wilson Guerra, as she warmed them up for class.
This was not Havana, or even Little Havana in Miami.
It was Louisville, a city best known for bourbon, the Kentucky Derby and Muhammad Ali. Now it is home to the fastest growing Cuban community in the United States.
"Salsa is part of our essence, and dancing is a fun way for our kids to learn about their heritage," said Ms. Wilson Guerra, 41, a mother of two who moved to the city in 2015.
Here, she added, "we're keeping Cuban culture alive."
In a landlocked state with cold, gray winters, Louisville may seem an unlikely destination for refugees from a tropical island. But its plentiful jobs, relatively low cost of living and nonprofit agencies that support newcomers are powerful magnets. Not to mention word of mouth from longtime Cuban residents.
According to independent estimates, at least 30,000 Cubans call Louisville's Jefferson County home, with much of the influx having arrived in the last two years as conditions deteriorated in their country. They now represent the largest single immigrant group in Louisville, and their numbers, which continue to swell, have helped offset population decline in the county of 770,000, according to the Census, as young Americans decamp to bigger cities. Many work at General Electric, Amazon and United Parcel Service, which have large operations in the area. The entrepreneurs among them have revitalized strip malls with new small businesses.
"The numbers have been huge, and people keep coming," said Danny Adam, a case worker at Kentucky Refugee Ministries, where Cuban newcomers receive assistance.
They have transformed the city's dining and entertainment scenes. At La Bodeguita de Mima, in the trendy NuLu neighborhood, foodies savor Cuban specialties such as ropa vieja, a juicy shredded beef dish, and indulge in a cigar-shaped dessert served in a Cuban cigar box at a luxurious ambience evocative of 1950s Havana. Opportunities abound to hear live music and gyrate to salsa grooves, virtually every night of the week.
"The Cuban community has enriched my life and brought pizazz to the city," said Debra Wright, a speech therapist, born and raised in Louisville, who attends Ms. Wilson Guerra's adult dance class.
Cubans began trickling into Jefferson County in 1995, after the Clinton administration and the Castro government signed an accord to allow 20,000 Cubans annually into the United States through a lottery. Some of the winners, who did not have family to receive them in places like Miami, were funneled to smaller cities -- Buffalo, N.Y., Lancaster, Pa., and Louisville.
"When I arrived 23 years ago, there weren't even 500 of us," said Luis David Fuentes, 52, founder of "El Kentubano," a free Spanish-language ad-packed monthly magazine.
By 2010, there were nearly 6,000 Cubans in Jefferson County. By 2021, the Cuban population had doubled.
Then came the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in Cuba. Shortages of food, medicine and electricity, as well as protests met with crackdowns on dissent, driving thousands more Cubans to seek entry into the United States.
Because of the Cold War legacy, Cubans who reach the United States, even illegally, are afforded special treatment by the government, unlike migrants from most countries. They receive public benefits, including cash assistance, job placement and other services. Cubans are also eligible to apply for permanent residency after a year.
Inundated with Cuban arrivals, Jefferson County's school district has had to register new students on Saturdays and Sundays. "We had never seen this before; nobody was ready," said Berta Weyenberg, coordinator for new multilingual students in the district that tallied 15,000 English language learners last year, a record.
In response to the influx, the district in July named an assistant superintendent to oversee the immigrant students. Every school in Jefferson County as of last year offered ESL classes.
Nonprofits have struggled to meet demand for adult English classes.
All told, more than 14,000 new Cuban immigrants have settled in the metropolitan area in the last two years, and an unknown number have relocated from Florida and other states where they had been living. Those interviewed by The New York Times said they have not felt any hostility from Kentuckians, though newcomers tend to live in immigrant-populated enclaves.
"I had never dreamed of coming to this country, but it became impossible to survive on our salaries in Cuba, even with a university education," said Yisel Buron Casas, 41, a television producer. She said that only people with ties to the regime, or with family members in the United States, could manage, and that it was less expensive to live in Louisville than in Miami.
The new "Kentubanos" have brought prosperity to old-timers, like Sandra Amador, whose small business caters to followers of Santeria, a religion that blends Afro-Cuban spiritual elements with Catholicism.
Business is brisk at her Poplar Level Road shop, which is jammed with prayer candles, special ointments and statues of orishas, deities worshiped by their devotees.
At Cash Saver, a supermarket where shelves are stacked with Cuban bread and coffee, three varieties of a root vegetable called malanga, and other items that Cubans crave, sales have tripled and the staff has grown to 15 from three in the last three years.
The line stretches out the door on weekends at Sweet Havana, where Carmen Coro, a Cuban transplant from Las Vegas, prepares flaky pastries filled with guava, coconut and dulce de leche, and staples like overstuffed pork sandwiches.
After arriving in 2016, Roberto Quintana, 34, worked at a carwash until he saved enough money to open a barbershop two years ago. He has since bought a three-bedroom house for his young family. "I realized my dreams in Louisville," said Mr. Quintana, trimming a customer's sideburns.
Since Cubans began settling here in significant numbers, new needs have emerged. Yarima Hernandez started Buena Vida -- the senior center where residents were salsa dancing -- three years ago to serve older immigrants with memory loss, limited mobility and other age-related health issues. On a recent day, after a welter of activities to sharpen their minds and bodies, they dug into a lunch of tamales, black beans and picadillo, or minced meat.
In a quiet back room, Martin Guzmán, 83, a retired engineer, talked about his life's path. He decided it was time to leave Cuba after he was forced to line up at 4 a.m. in Havana if he wanted medication for his heart condition and diabetes.
After journeying 54 days last year, he reached the Mexico-U.S. border. "If I had stayed in Cuba, I'd be dead," said Mr. Guzmán, adding, "it's magnificent here."

Full text: Mocktails and sunscreen, masking and mindfulness -- for those of us who strive to be upright, responsible citizens, the constant reminders of various ways we ought to be good are all around us. They're almost enough to make you forget the pleasures of being a little bit bad. We asked 13 writers -- most of them respectable adults -- about the irresponsible, immoral, indulgent things they do. Transgression has the power to teach us something about how we ought to live. But it's also just . . . fun? I'm a responsible middle-aged adult. I wear sunscreen. I hydrate. I've been cutting down on caffeine and alcohol. I don't have many vices left. But from time to time, I go to concerts with my friends and drop acid. If psychedelics have therapeutic value, I don't want to know. They've already ruined weed -- they, the people who ruin things -- by adding the word "medicinal." I don't need another medication. I'm not searching for enlightenment. Concerts are just better with a little nudge. I do drugs because it's fun. Lauren Hough, author who drinks only decaf after 3 p.m. I was 7 when I performed my first fatality. Commanded to finish my opponent, whom I had punched, kicked and smashed into a pulp, I shot lightning into the dazed body until the head burst like a water balloon. A geyser of neon red blood erupted from where the neck used to be, the drops audibly splashing onto the ground. This is to say that the early-'90s moral panic instigated by the graphic violence of Mortal Kombat was not entirely misguided. Three decades and countless technological leaps later -- photo-realistic C.G.I., sophisticated fluid dynamics and incredibly detailed anatomical models -- the only way to describe Mortal Kombat's fatalities now is "baroque." In a trailer for the forthcoming Mortal Kombat 1, a character punches through her foe's chest, rips out the long intestine, lights it like a fuse, then kicks the head into the air just in time for it to explode in a shower of pink fireworks. The blood is viscous, the viscera is wet, the faces twist and screw in horror -- yet it's never been more fun to watch. The joy of a Mortal Kombat game lies almost entirely in seeing what extravagant new ways its creators have devised to mutilate their meat puppets. I don't care for meanspirited, degrading torture porn, à la Hostel or Saw, am unnerved by Cronenbergesque body horror and abhor actual violence. But overthe-top ultraviolence, imagineered to push the boundaries of good taste with an impish sense of humor and tons of blood? I'll bathe in that. Matt Buchanan, journalist, author and pacifist in real life. I'm not a drunk. And I'm not a liar. But I am, unequivocally, a drunk liar. After a few tequila shots and an audience of strangers (usually men), I've become: a Harvard graduate, an up-and-coming model, an athlete, a virgin, a Kennedy. It's adult make-believe. It's free entertainment. There is something irresistible about telling a big, wet, flapping, booze-induced lie to people (men) that you almost certainly will never see again. Almost. When I was 19, I convinced a man that I was British and kept the lie going for three dates. Years later, we bumped into each other in public, in my pitiful American form, resulting in a humiliating exposition that left everyone questioning my sanity. But who was the real idiot there? Delaney Rowe,actress, comedy writer and could actually be a Kennedy someday, who knows? Gossiping is a habit I inherited from my mother, who is the biggest gossip I know. It is a pleasure I now share with my husband. If you're reading this and are among our loved ones, know that your personal life is a regular topic of discussion in our house: your marriage, your divorce, your childhood, your parenthood, your transgression that one time in college. It mostly comes from a place of sincere interest and care: Loving you makes me want to tell stories about you. But I admit that as far as love languages go, it's an unconventional one, neglecting as it does the whole question of your feelings about it all. They say you should treat others as you want to be treated. I've been told what makes my love of gossip unusual is that I also love being gossiped about. I have a friend -- let's call her X -- who once accidentally sent me a text message about how dumb she thought my novel was. (It was meant for a different friend.) Part of me was mortified and hurt. Another part thought: X was thinking of me! Later, of course, my husband and I dissected it all: X's shortcomings and travails, the insecurities that might have compelled her to send such a message. Also, her transgression that one time in college. Vauhini Vara, journalist, author and mostly a very good friend. I sleep with my friends, and I befriend the people I sleep with. As a result, my social life mostly consists of a sort of merry traveling band of fellows with whom I have happily porous and shifting relationships. This is what we all used to do when we were young and then grew out of when we moved into the serious part of life. Except I just didn't. I know this sounds like hell to most people -- the lack of boundaries and the mess and the logistics -- and it certainly can be. I've been hurt and I have hurt people. It's icky and embarrassing and kind of a pain in the ass. When it works, though, it feels like a vindication that the worth men and women can hold for one another is beyond sexual and romantic and also that it can continuously change, like everything else. When it doesn't, it's still pretty hot. Megan Nolan, novelist, journalist and friend. My grandfather owned a music store that went out of business after a Best Buy moved into town. As a teenager, I judged and resented every person who shuffled past my grandfather's store and into the air-conditioned glory of Best Buy. I promised myself that I would never support our evil franchise overlords. But the passing years have worn down my resolve. Today, I shop at a corporation that threatens more than music stores -- the all-consuming monster that is Amazon, destroyer of local retail. Why? Because it's easy. I can go to my clothing drawer, get frustrated by how few decent socks I have left and place an order that might arrive later that same day. Whatever I type into the search bar is guaranteed to appear: shoes, books, electronics and nibbles for the dog. We have access to a universal store that never closes. I chide myself for selling out, until I need a new pair of sweats fast. Esau McCaulley, contributing Opinion writer, author and usually an ethical consumer.
As a menswear writer who makes a living encouraging others to "buy less, buy better," I have an embarrassing confession. Sandwiched in my closet between my trousers from bespoke tailoring shops and indie designers are not one but two pairs of plastic pants. They're Wrangler Wranchers, high-rise, flared-leg, pure-polyester pants made with Sta-Prest creases. They make 1970s soundtrack noises when I walk down the street and would melt in a fire. Since I live in a small apartment, they're never far from me when I smugly post about why people should consider the environment when building a wardrobe. They say we most harshly judge others for the characteristics we recognize in ourselves, and that may be true. I purchased these three years ago after reading about them in New York magazine. The trousers were a bit popular back then, slotting in nicely with the 1970s sleaze comeback we've seen in both men's and women's fashion. When I put them on, I feel like the older Henry Hill in "Goodfellas" or the nomadic criminal Bob Hughes in "Drugstore Cowboy." In reality, I'm just a guy who lives alone with a loud cat. But that's the seductiveness of fashion -- the notion that we can escape ourselves and live a more interesting life through a pair of $ 30 pants, even if it means that some unfortunate fish somewhere will eventually ingest these plastic fibers.

Full text: After a fierce rally largely propelled by a handful of tech stocks, the market's rapid climb stalled in August. That setback could ultimately be a good thing, our columnist says.
The stock market's monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.
I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market's summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.
Don't misunderstand. It's not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I'd prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.
But that's a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur.
That's why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.
The Stock Market's Movements
That is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. In that period, the S&P 500 has returned 552.31 percent, or 7.8 percent, annualized, but to garner those handsome returns, an investor would have had to sit tight through countless downturns.
While August has so far been a negative month for the stock market, there have been no major downturns this year. Through July, the S&P 500 rose for five consecutive months. Just seven big tech stocks -- Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (Google) -- accounted for more than two-thirds of the S&P 500's gains.
This year, through July, the S&P 500 rose 19.5 percent, for a total return, including dividends, of 20.7 percent. Those were splendid numbers, but the market had been rising so rapidly on such a narrow base that it seemed to me that it was setting itself up for a fall.
What's more, from a market bottom on Oct. 11, 2022, through July, the S&P 500 gained 27.9 percent, for a total return of 29.6 percent including dividends. In June, when the market had gained 20 percent from its October low, many commentators declared that the bear market that started on Jan. 3, 2022, was over, and that a new bull market had begun.
Mr. Silverblatt did not agree, because the market had not returned to its peak of Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 stood at 4,796.56, almost 9 percent above its current level. By his definition, it won't be clear that the S&P 500 is in a bull market until it climbs back to that level. Categorizing the market this way, as either bull or bear, is a straightforward retrospective judgment, not an assertion of the market's future direction, which no one can forecast accurately.
This cautious way of thinking about the market is one I favor.
I'm not sure what the rally that started in October will amount to, but based on history, the summer swoon could be a good thing.
The stock market's problems in August stem, at least partly, from shifts in the fixed-income markets: a sharp rise in short-term interest rates underway since the start of 2022, and a surge in long-term rates since June.
The Lure of Fixed Income
Thanks to the rise in short-term rates, it's possible to get a great return on cash. Money market funds provide yields well above 5 percent.
Bond yields have risen this summer, and they are now high enough to make bonds, with their safer profiles, an attractive alternative to stocks. And many factors driving up yields are negative for stocks, too.
Briefly put, short-term rates -- those embodied in money-market funds as well as credit cards -- are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve's campaign to reduce inflation. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy, mainly by raising the short-term rates it controls, the best known being the federal funds rate.
On Friday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said that until there is conclusive evidence that inflation has been tamed, the central bank will maintain these rate levels or take them higher.
Longer-term interest rates -- those for bonds and mortgages -- have been rising, too. But these rates are complicated. They are set in the vast bond market.
By bidding down bond prices and raising yields (prices and yields move in opposite directions, as a matter of basic bond-market math), traders have indicated that they consider the economy to be stronger and inflation to be more persistent than had been expected a few months ago. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency also contributed to the run-up in rates on Treasury securities. And because Treasuries serve as benchmarks for virtually every other bond and, indeed, for every other investment in the global economy, higher rates have made stocks less appealing in comparison.
In addition, the balance of supply and demand in the bond market has been tilting in a way that is contributing to higher rates. The Treasury has been auctioning an unusually large amount of debt, bulking up its resources after the brinkmanship of the debt ceiling crisis this spring. That increase in the supply of Treasuries coincides with a reduction in demand from several important sources: The Federal Reserve is no longer purchasing bonds, while the appetite for Treasuries from Japan and China has begun to flag, too.
All these factors have contributed to the run-up in yields, and they are weighing on stocks.
Reading the Economy
Furthermore, one core issue assessed by bond buyers -- the prospects for economic growth or recession in the United States and elsewhere around the world -- has obsessed stock traders, too. But, at the moment, the U.S. economy is extraordinarily difficult to decipher.
Higher interest rates might have been expected to slow down the economy by now, or throw it into recession. A waning of economic growth in China might also be expected to be a drag on the U.S. economy.
But the U.S. economy and the job market, in particular, have been remarkably resilient, and consumer spending remains strong. As a consequence, corporate earnings in many sectors have exceeded Wall Street's muted expectations. If a recession were to develop, however, the outlook would be much worse.
All that said, there are many reasons for optimism. In July, the market rally broadened substantially, with the stocks of smaller companies outperforming the giants, and every domestic sector posting gains. It was just what a stock investor would want to see in a market with sustainable upward momentum.
Even the surge in interest rates could turn out to be innocuous. After all, it has returned rates to a level deemed healthy in previous economic cycles. Since January 1962, 10-year Treasury yields have averaged 4.2 percent -- not far from where they are now. The appropriate level for interest rates for the rest of this decade is being debated at the Fed and among a broad range of economists.
In short, uncertainty about inflation and the Fed's response to it are well-founded. The paths of the markets and the economy may meander inconclusively for a while, thwarting anyone who wants to place a decisive bet one way or another.
But it's a complicated world. Binary distinctions like bull market and bear market reduce complexity to simple notions that investors can grab onto. But I think these, in particular, are the wrong notions.
The bull and bear market labels imply future action.
In a bull market, stocks, for the most part, rise. In a bear market, more often than not, they fall. You might assume that you should avoid bear markets and welcome bull markets. But that's not a wise course for long-term investors, who are better off buying when prices are low and selling only at moments of their own choosing.
I'm bullish about the stock market for the long haul. But that's very different from believing that we are in a bull market or a bear right now. I just don't know and don't really care.
Instead, I'm investing for the long run, without trying to time market movements or pick individual stocks or bonds. I hold a piece of the world's entire stock and bond markets -- not just the S&P 500 -- through low-cost, broadly diversified index funds, and have been hanging in for decades.
Market rallies are fun, and it's a letdown when they take a breather. But an August pause could be just the thing the stock market needs. I worry about lots of things, but not that. Enjoy the rest of the summer.

Protecting Competition Is a Vital Goal: [Editorial]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/protecting-competition-is-vital-goal/docview/2857512247/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Across the American economy, in industries ranging from air travel to veterinary medicine, big companies keep getting bigger and more powerful. Swallowing smaller rivals has become a widely accepted practice.
This concentration of corporate power, however, is neither inevitable nor desirable for the health of the American economy.
The Biden administration is embarking on a wide-ranging effort to check corporate power by promoting competition -- a stated goal of both parties -- and it needs Congress to support its effort with bipartisan legislation. It has proposed new rules, like a ban on noncompete agreements that prevent workers from changing jobs more freely. It is seeding competition, for example, by investing more than $ 1 billion to open and expand smaller meatpacking plants. And it has taken a tough line on mergers, blocking some big deals, dissuading companies from pursuing others and even suing to unwind Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram.
Last month, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, which are charged with enforcing antitrust laws, proposed new merger guidelines that would formalize this turn toward stringency, ending decades of acquiescence to corporations by both Democratic and Republican administrations. The document explains what the administration regards as illegal, creating a basis for consistent enforcement, putting companies on notice and preparing judges for the cases that may come before them.
This reassertion of an active government role in protecting competition has the potential to deliver significant benefits. Competition keeps pressure on prices. It encourages the development of better and more diverse products and services. It holds open the gates of opportunity so workers can pursue other jobs or start their own businesses. It helps to ensure that prosperity and political power are broadly distributed.
"In my view, it's the most important economic policy thing that the Biden administration will do this year," said Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor who served until earlier this year as President Biden's adviser on technology and competition policy. Mr. Wu, who was not involved in creating the proposed guidelines, said the document reflected a determination to end a "green light" era in which American antitrust enforcers largely declined to enforce antitrust laws.
But the shift comes with real risks, too. Tighter enforcement could inhibit the growth of companies that have prospered through innovation or through the delivery of goods and services at lower costs. Bigger companies may be better equipped to compete in the global marketplace.
For several decades, beginning under President Ronald Reagan, both Democratic and Republican administrations embraced the idea that corporate concentration was often economically beneficial -- and that companies engaged in harmful behavior would be disciplined by market forces. The merger guidelines issued by the Reagan administration in 1982 set the tone: "Although they sometimes harm competition, mergers generally play an important role in a free enterprise economy," the guidelines said. Under subsequent administrations, the government refined an approach that gave corporations the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't enough to show a merger would reduce competition; the government generally sought to block deals only when it could show a merger would result in higher prices for consumers or that it would clearly cause some other quantifiable harm -- a standard that was rarely met.
Under this E-ZPass approach to antitrust enforcement, industries rapidly consolidated until the United States was left with four major airlines, three major cellphone companies and two dominant makers of coffins. A 2018 analysis concluded that concentration had increased in three-quarters of domestic industries, giving companies more power to raise prices, squeeze suppliers, suppress wages and influence policymakers.
Americans have been living as subjects in a large-scale experiment in letting big companies do as they please, and the consequences are increasingly apparent in daily life. Compare the United States with Europe, where authorities have more successfully resisted the consolidation of major industries. Airfares in the United States are now significantly more expensive; North American airlines pocketed more than twice as much in profits from each passenger in 2022 as their European counterparts did. The internet costs more, too: Americans pay more than twice as much for broadband, and the cost of cellular service is also, on average, more than twice as high in the United States as the average in other developed nations. The economist Thomas Philippon wrote in a 2019 book about the decline of competition in the United States that the American economy would be roughly $ 1 trillion larger than it is today if the United States had simply maintained the level of competition that prevailed in 2000.
The turn toward stringency reflects some of what has been learned in recent years about the effects of corporate concentration, for example, in a new emphasis on protecting workers. Economic circumstances also have changed. The rise of online business models in particular has created challenges not fully anticipated by earlier generations of policymakers, such as the ways that user data can be used to limit competition. In December, Amazon settled an antitrust complaint brought by European Union regulators by agreeing to stop using data gathered from third-party sellers on its site to calibrate its own retail business decisions.
The most important change, however, is a reconsideration of the role of economics in making policy. The guidelines treat the economic analysis of corporate concentration as a valuable source of information, rather than the measuring stick by which decisions are made. Antitrust authorities have failed in their responsibility to the American people by assigning to themselves the burden of trying to figure out which mergers may be harmful, rather than taking seriously their marching orders from Congress to prevent concentration.
Some harms are difficult to quantify. Some are difficult to anticipate. And sometimes the damage is cumulative. In separate interviews, Jonathan Kanter, the assistant attorney general who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division, and Lina Khan, the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued that the changes should be seen as a restoration of the plain meaning of the nation's antitrust laws, which place limits on corporate concentration even when it isn't possible to show negative economic effects in advance. Mr. Kanter said his department is focused on protecting competition because that is the goal that Congress enshrined in law and he is in the law enforcement business. "We're going back to enforcing the law to its fullest extent," he said.
To achieve this goal, the administration will need to overcome the skepticism of federal judges, many of whom are steeped in the minimalist approach to antitrust enforcement. The regulatory agencies have lost several cases in which they sought to enforce antitrust laws more stringently, including decisions allowing the tech giant Meta to buy Within, a maker of virtual reality apps, and to let Microsoft proceed with its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which makes video games.
A key element of the Reagan administration's antitrust revolution was to put on the bench legal scholars who had played leading roles in developing what might be called the anti-antitrust movement. The Biden administration so far has not emulated that strategy. Through the guidelines, however, it is at least seeking to change minds. The document can be understood as an open letter to the judiciary, encrusted in footnotes and references, pressing the argument that a shift is not just good policy but also good law.
Congress can help. Prominent politicians in both parties regularly express concern about the effects of concentration and the power of corporations, but Congress has not passed a significant law addressing antitrust enforcement in more than 70 years. The proposed guidelines seek to apply those old laws to the modern economy, but it's an imperfect fit. The United States needs to update its antitrust laws to place stronger limits on corporate concentration and specifically to curb the power of tech companies. Bridging differences between the two political parties won't be easy, but enduring changes in antitrust policy have always required bipartisan support.

The City's Plan to Limit E-Bike Battery Fires: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Next month, a new city law will ban the sale of e-bikes and e-scooters that have not been certified for safety.
Electric bikes and scooters are an increasingly popular and convenient way to move around New York City, but the lithium-ion batteries that power these micro-mobility devices have become a leading cause of deadly fires.
Now, New York will become the first city in the United States to regulate the safety of e-bikes and e-scooters, but confusion around the new law has led some to ask if the city is banning them.
Here's what to know about e-bikes in New York City.
What classifies as an e-bike in New York?
The city currently allows three classes of e-bikes, all of which must have operable pedals and top out at 25 miles per hour.
E-bikes that have been modified to go faster are not legal.
E-scooters, which can be stand-on or have a seat, are legal if they weigh less than 100 pounds and only go up to 15 m.p.h. Electric mopeds -- like those rented through Revel -- are also legal, but they must be registered with the state and require a driver's license to operate.
Most e-bikes and e-scooters only became legal on New York streets in 2020, though in reality they were already in use. There is no official tally of their numbers since, unlike cars, these devices are not registered.
Some other kinds of e-mobility devices remain illegal on city streets, including skateboards, unicycles, hoverboards and Segways.
E-bikes and e-scooters are allowed in bike lanes and on streets where the speed limit is no greater than 30 m.p.h. Mopeds (electric and gas) are not allowed in bike lanes.
Why are e-bike fires deadly?
Lithium battery fires have killed 14 people and injured 93 others in New York this year, including a blaze at an e-bike shop near Chinatown that caused four deaths in June. There have been 154 fires this year as of Aug. 14.
The batteries, which are also used in laptops and smartphones, can overheat or malfunction -- and not only when they are charging. If that happens, they can spark explosive, fast-moving fires with little or no warning, leaving just seconds to escape. Batteries have burst into flames while parked near a door or window, trapping people inside their apartments.
New York's leaders have tried to battle the fires on multiple fronts, including targeting unsafe battery conditions at e-bike stores, running public service announcements about e-mobility hazards, and lobbying for greater state and federal oversight over e-mobility devices.
What will the new law do?
Local Law 39, which takes effect on Sept. 16, will prohibit the sale, lease or rental of e-bikes and e-scooters -- along with their batteries -- that fail to meet recognized industry safety standards.
Inspectors for the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, which will enforce the new law, will begin issuing violations to stores and retailers on Amazon and other online sites that sell, lease or rent uncertified devices, and to manufacturers that sell directly in the city.
Inspectors will also issue violations to resellers of used e-bikes and other e-mobility devices in marketplaces like Craigslist.
Individuals using the uncertified devices will not receive violations.
Violations can result in fines of up to $ 1,000 for each type of uncertified device that is found.
But the new law does not cover uncertified personal devices that are already in homes. It also does not apply to devices that are bought or leased outside the city -- in New Jersey or Connecticut, for instance -- and then used in the city.
New York's law is part of a growing national effort to make e-bikes and other e-mobility devices safer, and the state's lawmakers have proposed a federal safety standard for the lithium-ion batteries used in those devices.
What are the safety standards?
New York will require e-bikes to be tested and certified to a specific safety standard, known as UL 2849, which was developed by UL Standards & Engagement, a nonprofit organization, with input from the e-bike industry.
E-scooters will have to meet a similar safety standard, UL 2272. And lithium batteries that are sold separately for use in e-bikes and other e-mobility devices will be held to a third standard, UL 2271.
The e-bike standard specifically assesses the electrical system of an e-bike, including putting its lithium battery through a series of "torture tests" to see how it reacts when overcharged, dropped, punctured with a nail, and exposed to vibrations, water and extreme temperatures.
UL Solutions, a separate for-profit organization affiliated with UL Standards & Engagement that tests and certifies e-bikes, is not aware of any UL-tested and certified e-bikes that have caught fire. But a spokesman, Steven Brewster, cautioned that there were other factors that could cause e-bike batteries to fail, including using a charger that was not compatible with a UL-certified battery.
Until now, these safety standards have been voluntary. Only a small fraction of e-bike manufacturers have opted to test and certify their e-bike designs, in part because it can cost between $ 30,000 and $ 100,000, according to industry experts.
But since New York's law was approved in March, more manufacturers have gotten their e-bikes certified through UL Solutions or another authorized laboratory.
Currently, UL Solutions maintains a list of more than 20 companies that have certified e-bikes, and more than 40 companies that have certified e-scooters and personal e-mobility devices.
Is New York banning e-bikes and e-scooters?
Mayor Eric Adams and city officials have repeatedly emphasized that they are not banning e-bikes and e-scooters from New York streets. Indeed, they say that they recognize many commuters and delivery workers rely on e-mobility devices as a greener and more economical alternative to cars.
"Legal electric micromobility is a critical part of a safe, equitable and sustainable transportation landscape," Ydanis Rodriguez, the city's transportation commissioner, said when the new law was approved in March along with other safety measures for e-bikes. "These devices can make moving around the city easier for New Yorkers and are critical tools used by thousands of delivery workers to support our economy."
But there has been confusion around the new law because building owners and landlords have increasingly chosen to ban all e-bikes and e-scooters from their premises, regardless of whether they have been certified for safety.
How do I use my e-bike safely?
The safest place to store and charge an e-bike or e-scooter is outdoors, according to battery and fire safety experts, but that is not an option for many city dwellers. In New York, the majority of lithium battery fires have been in residential buildings.
Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh has urged anyone with an e-bike or e-mobility device at home to essentially do their own safety inspection.
To see if your bike has been tested and certified to the accepted safety standard, look for a label with a holographic UL mark on the bike frame or permanently affixed to its electronic case. The label will show "UL" inside a circle and "Certified" along with a safety number. Type the number into an online site to verify that the mark is authentic; watch out for counterfeits.
Do not use uncertified or refurbished batteries, which the city has also banned, or mix and match batteries and chargers that were not made to go together. Check if they are hot or have any sign of physical damage.
Do not keep e-bikes and e-scooters by an exit, including doors or windows, where a fire could block people from getting out. Do not overcharge batteries or leave devices plugged in to charge unattended.
"I do think that -- like most consumer devices -- these can and will be regulated," Commissioner Kavanagh said. "But it's getting to that point you know while battling these fires now."

Insecurity's Insidious And Overwhelming Power Over All of Us: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Since 2020, the richest 1 percent has captured nearly two-thirds of all new wealth globally -- almost twice as much money as the rest of the world's population. At the beginning of last year, it was estimated that 10 billionaire men possessed six times as much wealth as the poorest three billion people on Earth. In the United States, the richest 10 percent of households own more than 70 percent of the country's assets.
Such statistics are appalling. They have also become familiar. Since it was catapulted onto the national stage more than a decade ago by Occupy Wall Street, "inequality" has been a frequent topic of conversation in American political life. It helped animate Bernie Sanders's influential campaigns, reshaped academic scholarship, shifted public policy, and continues to galvanize protest. And yet, however important focusing on the inequality crisis has been, it has also proven insufficient.
If we want to understand contemporary economic life, we need a more expansive framework. We need to think about insecurity. Where inequality encourages us to look up and down, to note extremes of indigence and opulence, insecurity encourages us to look sideways and recognize potentially powerful commonalities.
If inequality can be captured in statistics, insecurity requires talking about feelings: It is, to borrow a phrase from feminism, personal as well as political. Economic issues, I've come to realize, are also emotional ones: the spike of shame when a bill collector calls, the adrenaline when the rent or mortgage is due, the foreboding when you think about retirement.
And unlike inequality, insecurity is more than a binary of haves and have-nots. Its universality reveals the degree to which unnecessary suffering is widespread -- even among those who appear to be doing well. We are all, to varying degrees, overwhelmed and apprehensive, fearful of what the future might have in store. We are on guard, anxious, incomplete and exposed to risk. To cope, we scramble and strive, shoring ourselves up against potential threats. We work hard, shop hard, hustle, get credentialed, scrimp and save, invest, diet, self-medicate, meditate, exercise, exfoliate.
And yet security, for the most part, eludes us. That's because the main mechanisms by which we are told to gain security for ourselves -- making money, buying property, earning degrees, saving for retirement -- often involve being invested in systems that rarely provide the stability we crave. The stock in our 401(k), if we are lucky enough to have one, all too often supports industries that poison the planet; the tech company we work for undermines democracy; the rising price of the home we own makes it harder for others to stay housed.
Of course, living with uncertainty and risk is nothing new. How should mortal creatures who have spent our long evolution struggling to survive feel but insecure? The precarious and unpredictable nature of life is what helped inspire the ancient Stoics to counsel equanimity and Buddhist thinkers to develop the concept of Zen. A kind of existential insecurity is indelible to being human. It stems from being dependent on others for survival; from being vulnerable to physical and psychological illness and wounding and the looming fact of death. It is a kind of insecurity we can never wholly escape or armor ourselves against, try as we might.
But existential insecurity is not my focus here. The ways we structure our societies could make us more secure; the way we structure it now makes us less so. I call this "manufactured insecurity." Where existential insecurity is an inherent feature of our being -- and something I believe we need to accept and learn from -- manufactured insecurity facilitates exploitation and profit by waging a near constant assault on our self-esteem and well-being. In different ways, political philosophers, economists and advertising executives have pointed out how our economic system capitalizes on the insecurities it produces, which it then prods and perpetuates, making us all insecure by design. Only by reckoning with how deep manufactured insecurity runs will it become possible to envision something different.
Manufactured insecurity is far from inevitable, and yet it is intensifying. The same developments that have supercharged inequality in recent decades -- including the deregulation of finance and business and the decline of the welfare state -- have heightened insecurity and left no one, wealthy or working class, unscathed. While the relatively privileged seek ways to shield themselves from risk -- and even turn periodic shocks to their advantage -- the fact is they've rigged a game that can't be won, one that keeps them stressed and scrambling, and breathing the same smoke-tinged air as the rest of us. Which means they, too, have much to gain from rewriting its rules, including reimagining what new forms of security might entail.
For most of my life, it had never occurred to me to fret over the fat in my cheeks. I'd hardly heard the words "buccal fat," much less thought of it as something that I could or should worry about, until I saw buccal fat described in The Guardian as a "fresh source of insecurity to carry into the new year." Maybe you read the same article -- or maybe you discovered that you were supposed to be insecure about something else: the way you part your hair; the fit of your jeans; the make of your car; the size of your home or the way it is decorated.
As the British political theorist Mark Neocleous has noted, the modern word "insecurity" entered the English lexicon in the 17th century, just as our market-driven society was coming into being. Capitalism thrives on bad feelings. Discontented people buy more stuff -- an insight the old American trade magazine "Printers' Ink" stated bluntly in 1930: "Satisfied customers are not as profitable as discontented ones." It's hard to imagine any advertising or marketing department telling us that we're actually OK, and that it is the world, not us, that needs changing. All the while, manufactured insecurity encourages us to amass money and objects as surrogates for the kinds of security that cannot actually be commodified -- connection, meaning, purpose, contentment, safety, self-esteem, dignity and respect -- but which can only truly be found in community with others.
Part of the insidious and overwhelming power of insecurity is that, unlike inequality, it is subjective. Sentiments, or how real people actually feel, rarely map rationally onto statistics; you do not have to be at rock bottom to feel insecure, because insecurity results as much from expectation as from deprivation. Unlike inequality, which offers a snapshot of the distribution of wealth at a certain moment in time, insecurity spans the present and future, anticipating what may come next.
This is why insecurity affects people on every rung of the economic ladder, even if its harshest edge is predictably reserved for those at the bottom. Recent years have produced an abundance of scholarship demonstrating the negative effects of inequality on health and happiness across the board. Rising inequality, and the insecurity it causes, correlates with higher rates of physical illness, depression, anxiety, drug abuse and addiction. Living in a highly competitive, consumerist society makes everyone more status-conscious, stressed out and sick.
The philosopher Jeremy Bentham wrote about the "fear of losing" and how wealth itself becomes a source of worry. Assets must be guarded and grown, after all, lest fortunes be diminished or lost. "When insecurity reaches a certain point, the fear of losing prevents us from enjoying what we possess already. The care of preserving condemns us to a thousand sad and painful precautions, which yet are always liable to fail of their end," he wrote in "Theory of Legislation," published in 1802.
Bentham was referring to money and objects, which can be ported away by thieves, but he could also have been talking about status, which is impossible to steal yet is never secure. In a world of economic extremes, even the most prosperous are afraid of losing rank, of falling in both net worth and self-worth. It is this insecurity that keeps them grasping ever upward.
These people are suffering from what economists call "fractal inequality." But to those trapped inside the fractal's vertiginous snare, the overwhelming sensation is one of insecurity. The person who is in debt looks to the person with zero dollars, who looks to the person who has $ 50,000, who looks to the person who has six figures, who looks to the person who has half a million dollars, who looks to the person who has a million dollars in the bank, who looks to the person with twice as many assets. And on and on.
The dysphoria of feeling you don't have enough, even when you objectively have a lot, is not simply a spontaneous reaction to seeing others with more, a kind of lizard-brained lust, but rather the consequence of living in an insecure and risk-filled world in which there are no upper or lower limits on wealth and poverty. Left unchecked -- or, rather, untaxed -- the fractal's spiral never ends, as Silicon Valley's parade of billionaires jockeying for fame and dominance makes clear.
A few years ago, my sister was working at a hip Brooklyn cafe. The place has a vintage and vaguely Parisian aesthetic, retro and low-tech. There were, of course, regulars, including a medievalist who liked to chat. On a slow day, a barista on duty was exchanging pleasantries with the medievalist when her phone rang: The owner was watching the security camera from his laptop and told her to stop being so talkative. When I asked my sister how many cameras were installed in the small space, she identified at least eight, and said there might be more. The charming cafe was, in fact, a panopticon -- the boss able to tune in any time from anywhere and see from nearly every angle. Even when all they wanted to do was show a bit of kindness and community to a local eccentric, the workers were perpetually worried about being fired. The security cameras hadn't been installed to make the staff safer; they were there to make them feel insecure about holding on to their jobs.
It's not just baristas. From "pickers" at Amazon warehouses to grocery store clerks to radiologists to well-paid software engineers, workers are increasingly surveilled, tracked and ranked -- and made to feel like the rug could be pulled out from under them at any moment.
This manufactured insecurity reflects a cynical theory of human motivation, one that says people will work only under the threat of duress, not from an intrinsic desire to create, collaborate and care for one another. What the economist John Kenneth Galbraith called "the nerve-racking problem of insecurity" is, he argued, a feature inherent to our competitive economic system, one that takes the form of "episodic unemployment for the worker" on the one side, and "occasional insolvency for the farmer or businessman" on the other. "Along with the carrot of pecuniary reward," he wrote, "must go the stick of personal economic disaster."
The mere fear of job loss causes ill health, and losing your job or experiencing unwanted unemployment, scholars have shown, increases the risk of death. Here the problem is not necessarily poverty in absolute terms, but the insecurity that comes from instability and the threat of downward mobility and loss of status, a threat now omnipresent.
Today, people might have the same blue- or white-collar jobs their parents or grandparents had before them -- academic, office clerk, factory worker, janitor, driver, delivery person -- but they are so often now adjuncts, gig workers or temps employed by a private contractor, with few prospects for promotion or improvement in their job benefits, should they have any.
But even if you manage to ascend the professional ranks, you cannot afford to rest. In the United States today, all it takes is a devastating enough crisis to reduce the once fortunate to a state of precarity or poverty: Business could suddenly drop; a job could be automated or offshored; the stock in a retirement account could crash; home values could plummet; a family member could be diagnosed with a serious illness (something that, in the United States, can eviscerate the economic security of a middle-class household overnight); a storm could wreak havoc; another, more deadly pandemic could hit. The writer Barbara Ehrenreich, in her 1989 study of the psychology of the middle class, dubbed the condition "fear of falling." But today, the middle feels more precarious than ever, and everyone is afraid of what lies below.
These stresses don't excuse behavior like spying on employees, but they can help us understand what propels it. Constant insecurity helps keep us in line, while the conventional methods of achieving security fail us.
History, including recent history, shows that hard times, or even the mere anticipation of them -- the feeling of being economically insecure and anticipating the worst, whether or not those fears are objectively justified -- can increase the appeal of racism and xenophobia.
Across the world, the far right has gained ground by speaking directly to atomized and isolated people's anxieties, and by offering scapegoats: immigrants, Muslims, Jews, Black people, trans people, women seeking abortions. Too often, insecurity fuels the embrace of social hierarchy and domination. What more tempting solution to a discomfiting sense of insecurity than donning a mask of superiority and invincibility? Thus some people denounce "snowflakes" who need "safe spaces" while taking shelter behind bigotry, puffing themselves up by mocking fragility and denying their own vulnerability. In these cases, it's not enough to point out that such individuals are often more privileged or better off than others -- to emphasize inequality. Insecurity is about feelings as much as facts.
Instead we need to seek to channel insecurity in constructive ways. Indignation at the way our current system manufactures and exploits our fears and anxieties can help strengthen existing movements and coalesce new ones, uniting powerful -- and expanding -- coalitions that can fight for collective forms of security based in care and concern rather than desperation and distress.
My own experience as a co-founder of the Debt Collective, a union of debtors, showed me how economic insecurity can inspire people to organize for redistributive policies and an expanded welfare state. Inspired by the feminist consciousness-raising circles of the 1970s, we often host what we call debtors' assemblies: forums where people share their financial woes. Without fail, some people cry. They also find life-changing strength and camaraderie. In these sessions, insecurity becomes a gateway, how participants understand themselves and the wider world.
Under such conditions, economic insecurity can become a motor for renewing and improving our society. That's what happened in the wake of the Great Depression, when trade unionists, unemployed people, socialists, liberal reformers and visionary politicians highlighted insecurity as a central component of laissez-faire capitalism and mobilized to remedy it. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt denounced insecurity as "one of the most fearsome evils of our economic system" and invoked "security" as the justification for the New Deal that would form the foundation of the American welfare state.
For the last 50 years, this web of security-enhancing social policies has been shrinking. Then came Covid-19. As a result of a sudden increase in federal income support, millions of people -- my sister among them -- were materially secure enough to leave jobs where they had felt disrespected, abused, unhappy, bored, underpaid or unable to advance, leading to a historic "quit rate." For a time, the insecurity induced by the threat of job loss was greatly diminished. Some central banks stepped in to raise interest rates, which weakened the bargaining position of labor, ostensibly so the banks could target inflation, while politicians shut down the pandemic assistance programs -- some cited cost, but it seemed the real reason was that the programs gave workers too much power. The material security they provided was a threat to our insecurity-dependent status quo.
Rather than something to pathologize, I want us to see insecurity as an opportunity. We all need protection from life's hazards, natural or human-made. The simple acceptance of our mutual vulnerability -- of the fact that we all need and deserve care throughout our lives -- has potentially transformative implications. When we spur people on with insecurity because we expect the worst from them, we create a vicious cycle that stokes desperation and division while facilitating the kind of cutthroat competition and consumption that has brought our fragile planet to a catastrophic brink. When we extend trust and support to others, we improve everyone's security -- including our own.
Not only would reweaving the social safety net go a long way toward reducing the stress and strain that ails so many of us today, but also, a baseline of material security might enable us to face our existential insecurity with compassion and even curiosity.
Insecurity, after all, is what makes us human, and it is also what allows us to connect and change. "Nothing in Nature 'becomes itself' without being vulnerable," writes the physician Gabor Maté in "The Myth of Normal." "The mightiest tree's growth requires soft and supple shoots, just as the hardest-shelled crustacean must first molt and become soft." There is no growth, he observes, without emotional vulnerability.
The same also applies to societies. Recognizing our shared existential insecurity, and understanding how it is currently used against us, can be a first step toward forging solidarity. Solidarity, in the end, is one of the most important forms of security we can possess -- the security of confronting our shared predicament as humans on this planet in crisis, together.

The A.I. Industry's Desperate Hunt for Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To power artificial-intelligence products, start-ups and investors are taking extraordinary measures to obtain critical chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs.
For the past year, Jean Paoli, chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up Docugami, has been scrounging for what has become the hottest commodity in tech: computer chips.
In particular, Mr. Paoli needs a type of chip known as a graphics processing unit, or GPU, because it is the fastest and most efficient way to run the calculations that allow cutting-edge A.I. companies to analyze enormous amounts of data.
So he's called everyone he knows in the industry who can help. He's applied for a government grant that allows access to the chips. He's tried making Docugami's A.I. technology more efficient so it requires fewer GPUs. Two of his scientists have even repurposed old video gaming chips to help.
"I think about it as a rare earth metal at this point," Mr. Paoli said of the chips.
More than money, engineering talent, hype or even profits, tech companies this year are desperate for GPUs. The hunt for the essential component was kicked off last year when online chatbots like ChatGPT set off a wave of excitement over A.I., leading the entire tech industry to pile on and creating a shortage of the chips. In response, start-ups and their investors are now going to great lengths to get their hands on the tiny bits of silicon and the crucial "compute power" they provide.
The dearth of A.I. chips has been exacerbated because Nvidia, a longtime provider of the chips, has a virtual lock on the market. Inundated with demand, the Silicon Valley company -- which has surged to a $ 1 trillion valuation -- is expected to report record financial results next week.
Tech companies typically buy access to A.I. chips and their compute power through cloud computing services from the likes of Google, Microsoft and Amazon. That way, they do not have to build and operate their own data centers full of computer servers connected with specialized networking gear.
But the A.I. explosion has meant that there are long wait lists -- stretching to almost a year in some cases -- to access these chips at cloud computing companies, creating an unusual roadblock at a time when the tech industry sees nothing but opportunity and boundless growth for businesses building generative A.I., which can create its own images, text and video.
The largest tech firms can generally get their hands on GPUs more easily because of their size, deep pockets and market positions. That has left start-ups and researchers, which typically do not have the relationships or spending power, scrambling.
Their desperation is palpable. On social media, blog posts and conference panels, start-up founders and investors have started sharing highly technical tips for navigating the shortage. Some are gaming out how long they think it will take Nvidia's wait-list to clear. There's even a groan-worthy YouTube song, set to the tune of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire," in which an artist known as Weird A.I. Yankochip sings "GPUs are fire, we can never find 'em but we wanna buy 'em."
Some venture capital firms, including Index Ventures, are now using their connections to buy chips and then offering them to their portfolio companies. Entrepreneurs are rallying start-ups and research groups together to buy and share a cluster of GPUs.
At Docugami, Mr. Paoli weighed the possibility of diverting GPU resources from research and development to his product, an A.I. service that analyzes documents. Two weeks ago, he struck gold: Docugami secured access to the computing power it needed through a government program called Access, which is run by the National Science Foundation, a federal agency that funds science and engineering. Docugami had previously won a grant from NSF.
"That's the life of a start-up when you need GPUs," he said.
The lack of A.I. chips has been most acute for companies that are just starting out. In June, Eric Jonas left a job teaching computer science at the University of Chicago to raise money to start an A.I. drug discovery company. The scarce access to GPUs for university research projects had already been frustrating, but Mr. Jonas was shocked to discover it was just as hard for a start-up, he said.
"It's the Wild West," he said. "There is literally no capacity."
Mr. Jonas said he considered a range of undesirable options, including using older, less powerful chips and setting up his own data center. He also toyed with using chips from a friend's Bitcoin mining rig -- a computer designed to do the calculations that produce the digital currency -- but figured that would create more work since those chips were not programmed for the kind of work required by A.I.
For now, Mr. Jonas is calling in favors from friends at large equipment vendors and people who work at quantitative stock trading firms that might have extra GPUs or test labs that have GPUs that he could use. He said he did not need much -- just 64 GPUs for six hours at a time.
The strain is what recently prompted two founders, Evan Conrad and Alex Gajewski, to start the San Francisco Compute Group, a project that plans to let entrepreneurs and researchers buy access to GPUs in small amounts. After hundreds of emails and a dozen phone calls to cloud companies, equipment makers and brokers, they announced last month that they had secured 512 of Nvidia's H100 chips and would rent them out to interested parties.
The announcement went "hilariously viral," Mr. Conrad said, and resulted in hundreds of messages from founders, graduate students and other research organizations.
Mr. Conrad and Mr. Gajewski now plan to raise $ 25 million in a specialized kind of debt that uses the computer chips as collateral. Their vendor, whom the founders declined to name for fear that someone would swoop in and buy the GPUs out from under them, has promised access in around a month.
The duo said they hoped to help start-ups save money by buying only the computing power they need to experiment, rather than making large, yearslong commitments.
"Otherwise, the incumbents all win," Mr. Conrad said.
Venture capital investors have a similar goal. This month, Index Ventures struck a partnership with Oracle to provide a mix of Nvidia's H100 chips and an older version, called A100, to its very young portfolio companies at no cost.
Erin Price Wright, an Index Ventures investor, said the firm had seen its start-ups struggle to navigate the complicated process of getting computing power and landing in wait lists that were as long as nine months. Two companies are set to use the firm's new program, with others expressing interest.
Before the shortage, George Sivulka, chief executive of Hebbia, an A.I. productivity software maker, simply asked his cloud provider for more "instances," or virtual servers full of GPUs, as the company expanded. Now, he said, his contacts at the cloud companies either don't respond to his requests or add him to a four-month wait list. He has resorted to using customers and other connections to help make his case to the cloud companies. And he's constantly on the lookout for more.
"It's almost like talking about drugs: 'I know a guy who has H100s,"' he said.
Several months ago, some Hebbia engineers set up a server with some less-efficient GPUs in the company's Manhattan office, parked the machine in a closet and used it to work on smaller projects. Liquid cooling units keep the server from overheating, Mr. Sivulka said, but it's noisy.
"We shut the door," he said. "No one sits next to it."
The scarcity has created a stark contrast between the haves and have-nots. In June, Inflection AI, an A.I. start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., announced it had acquired 22,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips. It also said it raised $ 1.3 billion from Microsoft, Nvidia and others. Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection's chief executive, said in an interview that the company planned to spend at least 95 percent of the funds on GPUs.
"It's a seismic amount of compute," he said. "It's just eye-watering."
Other start-ups have asked him to share, he said, but the company is already at full capacity.

Beyoncé and Taylor Swift Make the Nation Shimmer: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Make the Whole Place Shimmer: America Spends Big for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift
Beyoncé told us that girls run the world. This summer, she and Taylor Swift seemed to prove it.
Both Beyoncé's "Renaissance" and Ms. Swift's "Eras" tours have become cultural phenomena that have swept across social media and are poised to shatter real-world records. "Eras" could top $ 1 billion in sales, making it the first concert in history to cross that mark. Some estimates suggest that Beyoncé's world tour could gross even more than that by the time it wraps in October.
It is the latest -- and some economists think final -- iteration of the "revenge spending" trend that took hold after the pandemic, in which people shifted their spending away from goods and toward experiences. Taylor Swift and Beyoncé fans have been shelling out on everything from secondhand tickets that cost more than a flight to Europe to fancy fingernails to match the singers' wardrobe.
While event spending overall is still just recovering to prepandemic levels, the marquee concerts this summer are spurring a lot of consumption.
The survey company QuestionPro estimates that Ms. Swift's concert could generate some $ 4.6 billion in economic activity in North America alone, taking into account both stadium capacity and people's reported spending plans on things like tickets, merchandise and travel. That would be roughly on par with the revenues the Beijing Olympics generated in 2008, after adjusting for inflation. Beyoncé's shows are expected to spur $ 4.5 billion in spending, based on a separate QuestionPro survey.
Cosmeticians, Cruises and Cocktails
It isn't just tickets that have motivated people to open their wallets. They are staying in hotel rooms, buying elaborate outfits, spending on flashy manicures and attending sideline parties that are generating business and boosting spending in host cities.
Shade Hotel, in Manhattan Beach, Calif., held a Taylor Swift pre-party where guests sported costumes, wore Swift-themed temporary tattoos and sipped on a signature "Lavender Haze" cocktail, a reference to one of the most popular songs on her latest album. Both the hotel and its neighbors reported surging demand that pushed up room rates and sold out many properties.
Boxie Studio in Los Angeles, which offers small photo studios of carefully curated backdrops for social media, was selling tickets that allowed visitors to film TikToks or snap Instagram shots in rooms that mirrored Taylor Swift music video sets. Props included the red scarf made famous by the song "All Too Well" and an "I love you" sign like the one that a lovelorn Ms. Swift flashed at her next-door neighbor in one 2009 music video.
Knock-on effects from the concerts have drawn the attention of national economic authorities: Sweden's statistics agency said that Beyoncé's tour helped to fuel inflation there, and a Federal Reserve survey of business contacts reported that Swifties had bolstered hotel revenues in the Philadelphia region.
While concert-related spending has not been concentrated enough to show up clearly in national data in the United States, some think it could help to slightly improve the odds of a gentle cool-down instead of an abrupt stop to economic activity. The events are keeping consumers active during a summer when shrinking savings might have otherwise slowed their spending.
"I think Taylor Swift is great for the soft landing," said Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School.
"The Beyoncé tour, the Eras tour, are the latest instance of that phenomenon," he said -- and possibly the tail end, as consumers exhaust pandemic savings and return to more normal patterns. "It might be that Taylor Swift and Beyoncé timed their tours perfectly."
The concerts have become a big boost for local tourism, as the Fed report hinted. Airbnb reported that Cincinnati was the platform's top trending destination for July 4 weekend travel -- beating out places like Mykonos island in Greece and the Amalfi Coast in Italy. The Ohio city hosted Ms. Swift that weekend.
The shows have also driven broader consumer spending in cities like New York, where searches for lounges, aestheticians and nail technicians in the week leading up to Beyoncé's performance in East Rutherford, N.J., saw triple-digit percentage increases compared to the year before, according to an analysis by Yelp. Concertgoers were also booking their hair and nail appointments weeks out.
Raven Voorhees, the owner of Free Edge Beauty Studio in Brooklyn, said she spent the month of July doing nails for clients attending Beyoncé concerts in cities like Philadelphia, Nashville and East Rutherford. Her clients requested nails that aligned with the theme of the Renaissance tour: lots of silver, metallic, gold and sparkle.
"It's boosting business," Ms. Voorhees said. "We're talking about someone who's paying about $ 60 max for her service to now $ 150 because she's doing a new set, she's getting the works, all of the nail art and then, even after that, having to come back and having to do it again."
Tara Lewis, who analyzes Yelp's data around the "Beyoncé bump," said she had seen "pops in every city" which gives her confidence that Beyoncé is the reason behind the lift.
America's hot concert summer has been enabled, in large part, by a hot job market. Unemployment is low and wages are rising, which is helping people afford big purchases like tickets and pricey hotel rooms.
In a survey fielded for The New York Times, QuestionPro found that about 50 percent of Taylor Swift fans used regular income to buy tickets and outfits, while 9 percent used savings built up during the pandemic. A bigger share used savings amassed before or after the public health crisis or relied on family help. Just a small share -- 4 percent -- borrowed money to afford the tickets.
Beyoncé fans also funded tickets heavily out of their income, and spent $ 1,800 on average for the concert.
Many companies have figured out how to capitalize on the hype. Ahead of Beyoncé's New Jersey appearance, Circle Line Cruise -- a New York staple known for ferrying tourists around Manhattan -- transformed into a dance floor where boat riders learned the Renaissance concert choreography. The 78-year-old cruise line has been trying to find ways to attract new customers and give locals a reason to step on board, said Alexis Melendez, Circle Line's marketing director.
The event, which took place the Thursday before Beyoncé's MetLife performances, sold out. The three-level cruise ship held about 300 people who had paid $ 25 for the two-hour ride where attendees grooved to a D.J. playing Beyoncé's thirty-year discography and followed directions from the dance instructor Byron Freeman.
Circle Line doubled the amount of bartenders, who were making $ 16 Beyoncé themed cocktails with names like "Alien Supermarg" and "Rum the World."
In Los Angeles, companies also seized on Taylor Swift's concerts to host branded activities. Truly LA, a venue showcasing the hard seltzer brand, hosted a friendship-bracelet making event on the sidelines of Taylor Swift concerts.
Swifties wear and trade the jewelry as a reference to a lyric in a song from Ms. Swift's latest album, in which she instructs listeners to "make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it." The events, which took place on Aug. 2 and Aug. 3, also encouraged attendees to trade their bracelets while listening to Ms. Swift and consuming specialty seltzer drinks.
"We are the visual."
Tara Vasquez, 39, stood outside of the Beyoncé show in late July in sparkling bejeweled eye make up, explaining that she has "a credit card for Beyoncé." She has gone to shows in each Beyoncé tour dating back to Destiny's Child, she said.
"Beyoncé is a splurge because she understands me; We grew up together," she said.
"Beyoncé says show up, and we show up," she said. The artist has not released a visual album with Renaissance like she had for her previous albums, but Ms. Vasquez said: "We are the visual."
"Beyoncé got a lot of money out of me: At this point, I'm going to claim her as a dependent on my taxes," Kalen Allen, 27, said outside of the MetLife stadium as he prepared to see Renaissance for the second night in a row. Professionally styled in a red and black ensemble, he estimated that he was spending $ 15,000 across multiple shows in multiple cities.
Bibi Peterson, 16, was attending Taylor Swift's concerts in Los Angeles three times -- including on Aug. 4 with her grandmother, brother and other family members. Her outfit cost her only about $ 25 in materials from Amazon, she estimated, because her grandmother sewed it. It was meant to look like the outfit Ms. Swift wore while singing "How You Get the Girl" during a previous tour, complete with glow lights.
"As a young woman, she really inspires me," Ms. Peterson said. "I love just watching her go out there and shimmer."
Public Transit and Party Buses
With thousands of people descending on stadiums across the country, transportation to the summer's big concerts also became an enterprise.
The founders of Foolonia, a New York-based event company founded in 2019 that focuses on providing inclusive spaces and unique outings, decided to offer group transit to Beyoncé's New Jersey concert. The entry fee was $ 100 and included Beyoncé trivia, giveaways like official tour merchandise and enough space to practice dance moves.
"Have we done a party bus before? No! But that's what we do," said Riley Wilson, a co-founder of the company. "We do divergent experiences."
And in Los Angeles, public transit stayed open late to ferry concertgoers. "We're enchanted that Taylor Swift fans have given a big boost to public transit across the United States this year -- and we're looking forward to spending our midnights with many of you very soon," the city's metro system punned on its website -- referencing Ms. Swift's song "Enchanted" and her recent album "Midnights."
Spending on the concerts may partly be taking the place of other events, vacations and consumption in general this summer: About half of respondents in both the Taylor Swift and the Beyoncé QuestionPro surveys said they would cut back elsewhere to afford the experiences, with many reporting that they were eating out less or skipping unnecessary entertainment.
Many attendees made it clear that having fun at the tours would be their priority.
"People are looking to experience a fun and groundbreaking way to celebrate their identity, to celebrate music," said Ozzie Henderson, a co-founder of Foolonia and a Beyoncé fan who started putting together his concert outfit since she announced her tour. "They're investing their money in a great experience."

Warming to West's Rivals, Emiratis Test Ties With U.S.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Arab Emirates, which has translated its wealth into outsize global influence, is diverging from U.S. foreign policy -- particularly when it comes to isolating Russia and limiting ties with China.
The ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, is a key American ally who counts on the United States to defend his country.
But he has traveled twice to Russia over the past year to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin, and in June, his country was celebrated as the guest of honor at the Russian leader's flagship investment forum. Later this month, the Emirati and Chinese air forces plan to train together for the first time, a notable shift for an oil-rich Gulf nation that has long relied on American fighter jets, weapons and protection.
These deepening relationships show how a Middle Eastern leader viewed by the U.S. government as an important partner is increasingly striking out on his own path. American officials have had limited success in persuading Sheikh Mohammed to align with U.S. foreign policy -- particularly when it comes to limiting Chinese military ties and isolating Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.
Instead, the Emirates has thrived on inflows of Russian money, oil and gold, fueling a feeding frenzy in real estate in the glittering metropolis of Dubai. The growing ties with both American rivals and expanding economies like India are all in preparation for a world that may someday be no longer dominated by the United States.
"What we're seeing in the international order is not necessarily a multipolar world, but we're seeing a more fluid world where things are changing," Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, told The New York Times recently. In a lecture in Arabic last year, he was much blunter, declaring that Western hegemony was "in its final days."
Over the past decade, Emirati leaders have grown concerned about Washington's long-term commitment to the Middle East, which still hosts tens of thousands of American military personnel. They fear a decline in American interest in the region -- and the military defense that comes with it -- and argue that Washington has not done enough to deter threats from Iran.
But at the same time, they continue to seek greater protection from the United States.
"I think it's a hard moment," Dana Stroul, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told The New York Times's editorial board in June when asked about the Emirati misgivings. The United States is still present in the region, but is "asking our partners to step up and do more, and that is a shift," she added.
A federation of seven sheikhdoms perched on the Persian Gulf, the Emirates is roughly the size of South Carolina. Though small, it is one of the world's leading oil exporters, and its sovereign wealth funds control an estimated $ 1.5 trillion in assets -- more than the market capitalization of Amazon.
As its authoritarian rulers test the boundaries of their relationship with Washington, they are relying on the outsize international influence that they have built through wealth.
Emirati rulers wrote the playbook that other Gulf governments -- notably Saudi Arabia -- are borrowing from as they try to diversify their economies away from dependence on oil and expand their sway overseas, including through sports.
The Emirates moved earlier than its neighbors to pursue a more independent foreign policy and deal more assertively with the United States -- a strategy that Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has since adopted.
It was a shift that developed partly out of a sense of vulnerability.
Until they united in the 1970s, the disparate territories that formed the Emirates had been British protectorates with a combined population of a few hundred thousand people. The new state was sandwiched between larger neighbors -- Iran and Saudi Arabia -- and some early observers expected it to be subsumed by them.
Instead, the Emirates turned into a regional power center. Today, Dubai is home to one of the world's busiest airports, the world's tallest skyscraper and a port company that operates facilities far beyond the Middle East.
Over the past few years, the Emirati leaders have seized opportunities presented by various calamities -- including the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine -- to cement their nation's status as a triumphant entrepôt, where British multimillionaires mingle with Russian oligarchs and Indian tycoons.
"The whole world knows us now," Mohammed Al Gergawi, an Emirati government minister, said in a rare appearance on a Saudi podcast last year. "They know our importance, and they know our influence on the world."
The country's bolder foreign policy began to emerge a decade ago, when the Arab Spring revolutions toppled regional strongmen around the same time that President Barack Obama declared a pivot to Asia. As the uprisings rearranged the Middle East's power structure, the Emirates sent soldiers and weapons into the multiple regional wars that ensued.
In 2014, the country launched airstrikes in Libya without notifying the United States, American officials said at the time. And in 2015, after an Iran-backed militia seized control of Yemen's capital, Emirati forces joined a Saudi-led military coalition to intervene. That war is still continuing, and it has plunged Yemen into one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
In 2019, the Emirates declared a withdrawal of their forces in Yemen. That marked the beginning of a period in which the government shifted its rhetoric -- if not always its actions -- to a softer, economically driven diplomacy and preached peacemaking across a region exhausted by conflict.
The country emphasized de-escalating tensions, particularly with Iran -- an approach that Saudi Arabia also embraced when it restored diplomatic relations with Tehran in a deal brokered by China this year.
Emirati frustrations with the United States have continued to simmer, though.
Sheikh Mohammed has not visited the United States since 2017. A deal to buy American F-35 fighter jets stalled in 2021, and the Emirates has sealed a number of agreements to obtain weaponry from other countries since then, including light attack aircraft from China.
"You really want a firm commitment to your security in a very difficult area," said Mr. Gargash, the adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, calling this an "existential issue."
The Emirates' status as a hub for business and tourism hinges on its relative safety in a volatile region.
But in January 2022, the capital, Abu Dhabi, came under drone and missile attacks claimed by the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen. One attack was thwarted with U.S. help -- the Americans deployed Patriot missile defenses from an air base. But another attack killed three people, and Emirati officials argued that the American response had been insufficient, with reassurance taking too long.
"Can the American system actually provide you with what you want?" Mr. Gargash said, signaling that he foresees a longer-term problem. "It's not about Biden. It's not about Trump. It's not about whoever comes later."
At a conference in the Gulf nation of Bahrain in November, Brett McGurk, a senior White House official handling Middle East policy, said he heard constant concerns about the American commitment to the region.
"We unquestionably are here to stay," he said.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year brought these tensions to the forefront.
The Emirates, along with many other countries, has made clear that it will not be forced to take sides. And Emirati officials argue they must keep dialogue open with Russia to pursue peace efforts and mediation.
When the Emirates abstained from a U.N. Security Council vote condemning Russia shortly after it invaded Ukraine, critics "came up with this phrase of 'fence-sitting,"' said Mohammed Baharoon, head of B'huth, a Dubai research center.
"It presumes there is a good side and a bad side -- you have to choose one, our way or the highway," he said.
Nevertheless, the top priority of Emirati leaders is still "to ensure that the U.S. has a greater stake in the region, not a lesser stake," said Dina Esfandiary, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group for the Middle East and North Africa.
Indeed, some of the Emirati foreign-policy shifts have been firmly in line with the interests of the White House. The Emirates was the Gulf's earliest proponent of normalizing relations with Israel, which it did in 2020 in a deal brokered by Donald J. Trump.
At the same time, a gradual decline in American soft power is palpable across the Middle East, local scholars and businesspeople say.
A recent survey sponsored by a Dubai-based public relations firm asked Arab youth which country had the most influence over their region. About a third of respondents said it was still the United States. But the second-most-common answer was not China or Russia -- it was the Emirates.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, is a key American ally who counts on the United States to defend his country.

Full text: When Michelle Reininger went to bed on Thursday, June 15, she wasn't worried about the weather. The last time she checked, the forecast had called for scattered showers. But in the middle of the night, an emergency alert blared on her phone: a severe thunderstorm warning. Winds were expected to reach 80 miles per hour. People should take cover in their homes. "I thought, Is this a joke?" she recalled.
Ten minutes later, she lost power as the storm tore through.
By 5 a.m., the worst had passed. Ms. Reininger dressed quickly in the dark. She needed to go check on her charges: the more than 300 residents of Chimp Haven, the chimpanzee sanctuary nearby, where she served as the colony director.
As soon as she left her home, the storm's toll became clear to her. "Everywhere I went, there was a tree across the road or power lines down," Ms. Reininger said. She and her colleagues, who were also making their way to work, soon discovered that a tree was blocking the main road to the sanctuary.
The group gathered at a nearby convenience store. As they formulated a plan, Ms. Reininger received a text message from the maintenance supervisor, who had found an alternate route into Chimp Haven. Trees were down not only on local roads, the supervisor said, but a large pine tree had also fallen in one of the chimpanzee habitats. The upper branches were resting atop the 18-foot wall surrounding the enclosure, creating a ramp that the chimps could use to escape.
For their own safety, and the safety of others, the chimpanzees needed to be secured inside immediately. "It had to be done now," Ms. Reininger said. "There was no time."
Safe and sound
Chimp Haven is a retirement home for research chimpanzees, including many owned or supported by the National Institutes of Health. Before arriving in Keithville, La., many were used in research on H.I.V. or hepatitis; others were involved in studies that focused on cognition or behavior. The sanctuary, which sits on 200 forested acres, aims to provide the chimps with a tranquil place to live out their days.
But extreme weather poses an increasing threat to that peace. "It's been so weird the last few years," Ms. Reininger said. "The weather just -- it'll come at you."
In recent years the area has been hit by torrential rains and hurricane-force winds. Tornadoes have spun through with disconcerting frequency; in December, two people died after one touched down in Keithville. And the danger is expected to grow as climate change supercharges storms, making hurricanes more intense and heavy downpours more frequent. Droughts, floods, wildfires and heat waves are all increasing threats.
So Chimp Haven is now running extreme-weather practice drills to teach the chimps to take shelter inside, quickly, when employees sound the alarm. Being able to recall the chimps on command will help the sanctuary to secure the chimps inside before a storm hits, keeping them safe -- and keeping them from escaping, if new opportunities suddenly appear.
During one recent winter storm, for instance, the moats that serve as natural barriers began to freeze. "We could have an escape situation if chimps walked over," said Rana Smith, the president and chief executive of Chimp Haven. "Or the ice breaks and they fall into the water, which would be an unfortunate situation."
The sanctuary has 30 social groups each living in its own designated space, and some emergencies might require only some groups to be secured indoors. So Chimp Haven has assigned a unique auditory cue to each group being trained. "Which has led to us searching far and wide on Amazon for a lot of different types of sounds," said Jordan Garbarino, the training program supervisor. A ringing cowbell means that Flora's group needs to hustle inside, for example, while a blaring bicycle alarm means the chimps in Daisy's group should take shelter.
Trainers begin by desensitizing the chimps to the sound, doling out bananas, Cheerios or other treats as it plays. Then, they move the snacks inside. Chimps who come indoors when they hear the alarm will find "forage" -- a snack mix containing popcorn, peanuts and sunflower seeds -- and receive another special treat, such as a Popsicle. Once the animals are reliably coming inside on cue, employees begin closing and locking the doors. Then, they train the chimps to complete the process faster and faster.
Five groups, which include a total of 65 chimps, are currently in different stages of training. The 19 members of Flora's group were the first to become fully trained, but they still regularly practice the recall to keep their skills sharp.
During a routine drill a few days before the June thunderstorm, the chimps showed what they could do. Clara Loesche, an animal care specialist, climbed onto the roof of a low-slung, concrete building. From this rooftop perch, the five-acre, tree-filled habitat that Flora's group called home looked nearly empty.
Then, Ms. Loesche began ringing the cowbell. Suddenly, chimps emerged from the woods, gamboling across the grassy lawn and clambering into the adjoining buildings. Ms. Loesche descended the stairs, looked at her watch, and brought a walkie-talkie to her mouth. "10 seconds until doors close," she said. Precisely 10 seconds later, she slid a big metal bolt shut.
"That's wonderful!" she exclaimed, in a singsong voice. Less than two minutes had passed since she had begun ringing the bell, and 18 of the 19 chimps were secured. The only holdout was the eponymous Flora, a timid 41-year-old who had been slow to take to the training. She had been performing well in recent months, Ms. Loesche said, but today she had dawdled by the door, hesitant to step inside.
Cheeky chimps
If the weather can be unpredictable, so can the chimpanzees. Like their human cousins, chimps are intelligent and idiosyncratic, and the recall training requires juggling many personalities, preferences and needs.
Sometimes this means accommodating dietary quirks -- the vegetable-loving Betsy turns up her nose at some fruit rewards -- and keeping tabs on shifting preferences. "Like, 'Who likes blue juice today? Who likes grape juice?"' said Rebekah Lewis, Chimp Haven's director of behavior. "I have three children, so for me it's very similar."
Some of the chimps are more food-motivated than others. A few have been known to try taking shelter in two buildings, running into one and then back outside and into another, in order to receive two treats. Others are more difficult to entice. Arden, a particularly outdoorsy adolescent who is starting to assert her independence, sometimes declines to come inside. "They all understand what we're asking, but they don't necessarily choose to come in every time," Ms. Loesche said.
Some chimps require an individualized training approach. Thirty-five-year-old Sheena is deaf and cannot hear auditory cues, so trainers are teaching her to come inside when they display a bright orange Frisbee. But a visual cue doesn't travel the way that sound does. So before they can recall Sheena, who lives in a sprawling outdoor habitat, employees have to find her.
"And she could be anywhere," Mrs. Garbarino said. "One day we had to drive down to the moat, and she was really at kind of the furthest point." But as soon as they flashed the Frisbee, she high-tailed it back to the bedrooms. "I could have wept," Mrs. Garbarino recalled.
Employees must also keep tabs on the animals' complex and ever-evolving social dynamics. Sometimes they can harness these relationships, deploying a cooperative chimp to encourage a more reluctant friend. "Sometimes we'll send out another chimp to go get that chimp to come in, like, 'No, no, no, you're making unwise decisions, let's go inside,"' Ms. Reininger said.
But often, these dynamics pose real challenges. Tensions can run high when valuable resources (say, Popsicles) are being distributed. Lower-ranking chimps are sometimes wary of coming inside with more dominant chimps, who might steal or pick a fight over the rewards.
That may have been why low-ranking Flora did not come inside during the June practice drill. "She doesn't have super high-ranked friends," Ms. Loesche said. "So that can make her feel a little unsure sometimes."
On that particular afternoon, they decided to let Flora linger outside. But had there been a real threat, they might have coaxed her in by offering a safe, private room or even better treats. "In an actual emergency," Mrs. Garbarino said, "we would go to great lengths to get them inside."
A sudden storm
Three days later, the thunderstorm, and the damage it left behind, became that emergency. With news of the fallen tree, a potential escape route for the chimps, several employees set off for the sanctuary, climbing through the tree that was blocking the road.
Chimp Haven had been hit hard. The forested walkway at the entrance was damaged. Trees had been snapped in half and branches littered the ground. The power was out and would remain so for six sweltering days.
Employees rushed to the habitat, unsure whether the 15 chimps who lived there, all members of Daisy's group, were still safely inside after "not knowing where they had been all night," Ms. Loesche said, "if they were lost, if they had been struck by lightning." Staff members had dart guns at the ready just in case they spotted a chimpanzee that had escaped.
They did a quick head count. After a brief scare -- at first they had trouble locating Betsy -- they were relieved to find all animals accounted for. "And then came the next round of adrenaline," Ms. Loesche said.
The tree was an ongoing hazard, and the chimps needed to be secured inside until it was removed. It was exactly the kind of situation that the recall training had been designed for, but it would not be a textbook recall.
Daisy's group was still acclimating to the wailing alarm that served as their auditory cue. Trainers had not yet laid out the full recall procedure for the chimps or run them through a complete drill. Today was not the day to try. "We didn't want to waste time making the noise when that isn't as established yet," Ms. Loesche said. "And it was such an unknown situation."
Fortunately, most of the chimps had gathered near the building, so staff members decided to lure them in with food. They began scattering forage and chimp chow, which drew some chimps inside. One caregiver dashed off to grab frozen grapes and strawberries, which attracted more animals. Popsicles won over the remaining stragglers.
Except for two: Destiny and Jeff Lebowski. Both chimps were known for being reluctant to come inside and had been utterly unmoved by the treats. So the team switched tactics.
The buildings and enclosures at Chimp Haven are connected by a network of elevated mesh-enclosed passageways, or chutes, which are used to move chimps to different locations. Most chimps love using the chutes, which are typically left closed and locked. "When you give them access to an area they're typically denied access to, that becomes very exciting to them," Ms. Reininger said.
Perhaps Destiny and Jeff Lebowski would be willing to scamper into a chute? They showed little interest in the first two that employees opened for them. But the third chute, which led to a yard inhabited by another chimp group, proved irresistible.
"They went in immediately," Ms. Loesche said. Employees closed the chute door, temporarily locking them inside. Finally, all 15 chimps had been secured.
But it had taken considerable improvisation -- and about an hour of effort. The recall training is designed to make the process quicker and easier the next time the weather wreaks havoc. "That would definitely be the goal and the hope," Ms. Loesche said.
And so, the drills continue. Since the storm, Destiny and Jeff Lebowski have been more reliable in training sessions, regularly abandoning their outdoor playgrounds, however begrudgingly, and hauling themselves indoors. "They would rather not," Ms. Loesche said. "But sometimes we need them to."

A Major Trucker, Yellow, Is Bankrupt While Rivals Prosper: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Yellow, which was lent $ 700 million in U.S. pandemic relief, failed after being a laggard for years in a part of the industry where rivals are doing well.
Yellow, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States, is now in bankruptcy, three years after it got a $ 700 million federal loan meant to help it weather the pandemic's upheaval. So why are rivals of the 99-year-old freight hauler doing just fine?
Yellow, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, had for years been an industry laggard. Analysts say that most trucking companies are strong enough to keep operating -- even after a steep fall in business following the pandemic boom in purchases of goods -- and that freight is unlikely to be much disrupted by Yellow's demise.
Investors are even betting on the industry's future, sending many trucking stocks sharply higher in recent weeks. "I don't look at Yellow's failure as much of a canary in the coal mine for the broader market," said Avery Vise, vice president of trucking at FTR, a forecasting firm that focuses on the freight industry.
The trucking industry has a variety of tiers. FedEx and UPS handle mostly retail packages. Walmart, Amazon and Target have big private fleets. For-hire truckload companies, hauling goods from a single shipper over long distances, include big enterprises and others with only one to five trucks, a segment that mushroomed in response to demand early in the pandemic.
Yellow, which had 30,000 employees and nearly 12,000 trucks, fell into another group -- the less-than-truckload sector, in which truckers fill containers with goods from more than one shipper and operate a hub-and-spoke system that moves goods in and out of terminals. The less-than-truckload business has emerged from the pandemic's supply-chain chaos in better shape than the much larger truckload segment.
In the five years through 2022, a period in which trucking boomed, Yellow racked up over $ 200 million in losses, while Old Dominion Freight Line, also a less-than-truckload company with revenues similar to Yellow's, reported over $ 4 billion in profit over the same period.
Some analysts said that Yellow's elevated costs were partly a result of the wage demands of its unionized work force. And Darren Hawkins, the company's chief executive, blamed the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the main union at Yellow, for obstructing management's efforts to make the company more competitive.
"A company has the right to manage its own operations," he said in a news release, "but as we have experienced, I.B.T. leadership was able to halt our business plan, literally driving our company out of business, despite every effort to work with them."
The Teamsters said Monday that the company's employees had made financial sacrifices to try to save Yellow from its troubles. "They shamelessly pin their corporate incompetence on working people," Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters' general president, said in a news release.
Some analysts also point the finger at Yellow's senior executives.
Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting Group, which advises transport and logistical companies, said that Yellow's efforts to absorb big acquisitions over the last two decades had largely backfired and that the company took in less revenue per shipment than its rivals. Mr. Jindel said one cause was Yellow's apparent inability to determine when to charge more.
He noted that ArcBest, a less-than-truckload company that is also unionized, had remained an important hauler in recent years partly because it had higher-paying customers. ArcBest, he said, took in $ 529 per shipment in the first quarter, versus $ 339 at Yellow. Mr. Jindel said Yellow was a laggard "largely because of mismanagement."
Yellow did not respond on Monday to a request to speak about its management record.
One company hoping to pick up business from Yellow is Saia, a less-than-truckload company near Atlanta. The company's stock has more than doubled this year, and is up 25 percent just since the end of June. The S&P 500 stock index, by comparison, is up nearly 18 percent this year.
"We did well through the pandemic disruption, and this may be another opportunity for us to move through a disrupted market and continue to gain share and grow the profitability of the company," Frederick Holzgrefe, chief executive of Saia, said in an interview, referring to Yellow's collapse.
The trucking industry plays a critical role in the U.S. economy, transporting nearly three-fourths of all freight tonnage in the United States, according to the American Trucking Associations, a trade group. It is also prone to boom-and-bust cycles.
Strong demand for goods like patio furniture and home appliances during the pandemic turbocharged the industry. Shipping volumes and rates ballooned, and drivers left companies to set up their own businesses, sometimes buying trucks at wildly inflated prices.
The number of trucking firms surged by more than 50 percent from March 2020 to June 2023, and the number of trucks by nearly 20 percent, according to estimates by FTR, based on the most recently available data. But nearly all that growth took place at companies with one to five trucks, according to FTR.
"Unprecedented is almost not even strong enough a word," Mr. Vise said. "It was almost an unfathomable surge in the number of new carriers coming into the market."
As services supplanted goods in driving consumer spending, the small truckers' revenues declined, but many of their costs -- including wages and debt -- did not. That crimped profit margins and left some with big losses. Now, tens of thousands of the smaller operators are shutting down, according to FTR, though in many cases the truckers may go to work for larger companies.
"Trucking has been in a recession, all of trucking," said Bob Costello, chief economist for the American Trucking Associations. "Even though the macro economy has not."
Still, there is less pain for less-than-truckload companies, which, for the most part, have not suffered steep declines in shipping rates. That's because a small number of companies account for most of the shipments in the less-than-truckload business, analysts said.
"It's amazing how all these carriers have actually been very disciplined about holding the line on pricing," said Ari Rosa, an analyst at Credit Suisse who covers trucking companies.
The stress has been concentrated among truckload companies. Entering the truckload business is easier because it requires having just a truck, rather than a network of terminals. As a result, the business is also more volatile and prone to suffer when a boom ends. Leading truckload companies like Knight-Swift and J.B. Hunt have reported big declines in earnings, but their stocks have rallied in recent weeks.
It is not yet clear how drivers will fare as the industry seeks to find a new balance.
Many received raises during the pandemic after years of relatively sluggish pay gains. Weekly wages in long-distance trucking -- a good proxy for truck driver pay, according to economists -- were $ 1,283 in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. That works out to nearly $ 67,000 a year, about 25 percent higher than in June 2019, not adjusted for inflation.
Industry analysts say companies have been loath to let go of drivers because of how hard it was to attract and keep them during the boom. But that can push up costs for companies when revenues are sagging.
"In terms of driver retention, we're performing pretty well," said Mr. Holzgrefe, the Saia chief executive. "Of course, we're going to make sure we pay very competitively."

As Weather Threats Loom, Even Chimps Learn to Shelter in Place

KEITHVILLE, La. — When Michelle Reininger went to bed on June 15, she wasn’t worried about the weather. The last time she checked, the forecast had called for scattered showers. But in the middle of the night, an emergency alert blared on her phone: a severe thunderstorm warning. Winds were expected to reach 80 mph. People should take cover in their homes. “I thought: Is this a joke?” she recalled.
Ten minutes later, she lost power as the storm tore through.
By 5 a.m., the worst had passed. Reininger dressed quickly in the dark. She needed to go check on her charges: the more than 300 residents of Chimp Haven, the chimpanzee sanctuary nearby, where she served as the colony director.
As soon as she left her home, the storm’s toll became clear to her. “Everywhere I went, there was a tree across the road or power lines down,” Reininger said. She and her colleagues, who were also making their way to work, soon discovered that a tree was blocking the main road to the sanctuary.
The group gathered at a convenience store. As they formulated a plan, Reininger received a text message from the maintenance supervisor, who had found an alternate route into Chimp Haven. Trees were down not only on roads, the supervisor said, but a large pine tree had fallen in one of the chimpanzee habitats. The upper branches were resting atop the 18-foot wall surrounding the enclosure, creating a ramp that the chimps could use to escape.
For their own safety, and the safety of others, the chimpanzees needed to be secured inside immediately. “It had to be done now,” Reininger said. “There was no time.”
Sounding the Alarm
Chimp Haven is a retirement home for research chimpanzees, including many owned or supported by the National Institutes of Health. Before arriving in Keithville, many were used in research on HIV or hepatitis; others were involved in studies that focused on cognition or behavior. The sanctuary, which sits on 200 forested acres, aims to provide the chimps with a tranquil place to live out their days.
But extreme weather poses an increasing threat to that peace. “It’s been so weird the last few years,” Reininger said. “The weather just — it’ll come at you.”
In recent years, the area has been hit by torrential rains and hurricane-force winds. Tornadoes have spun through with disconcerting frequency; in December, two people died after one touched down in Keithville. The danger is expected to grow as climate change supercharges storms, making hurricanes more intense and heavy downpours more frequent. Droughts, floods, wildfires and heat waves are increasing threats.
So, Chimp Haven is now running extreme-weather practice drills to teach the chimps to take shelter inside, quickly, when employees sound the alarm. Being able to recall the chimps on command will help the sanctuary to secure them inside before a storm hits, keeping them safe — and keeping them from escaping, if new opportunities suddenly appear.

If the weather can be unpredictable, so can the chimpanzees. Like their human cousins, chimps are intelligent and idiosyncratic, and the recall training requires juggling many personalities, preferences and needs.

And so, the drills continue. Since the storm, Destiny and Jeff Lebowski have been more reliable in training sessions, regularly abandoning their outdoor playgrounds, however begrudgingly, and hauling themselves indoors. “They would rather not,” Loesche said. “But sometimes, we need them to.”

Full text: From Belgium to the Bahamas, Mayor Eric Adams has raised the flags of at least 31 countries since taking office, a civic gesture with political benefits.
On any given weekday, there is a statistically significant chance that Eric Adams, the mayor of America's largest city, will be conducting official New York City business next to the upturned tail of the famed "Charging Bull" sculpture, engaging in what appears to be one of his favorite activities: raising flags.
He does it with such frequency that it borders on obsession: Since taking office in January 2022, Mr. Adams has raised flags for at least 31 countries representing 16 percent of the United Nations' member states. He has honored some places twice: Haiti, Ireland, Ukraine and the Philippines.
His flag-raisings are not limited to countries. He has also raised the flags for one U.S. territory, two transnational organizations and one holiday, Juneteenth.
If he keeps his current pace, Mr. Adams is on track to raise flags for roughly 80 percent of the world's countries by the end of 2029, should he win a second term in 2025 and serve it to completion.
At these ceremonies, Mr. Adams often extols certain characteristics that he attributes to the nation whose flag he is raising, characteristics that happen to be strikingly similar to each other, and to the mayor's politically moderate, law-and-order brand.
To Filipino Americans, the mayor said: "You believe in families. You believe in business. You believe in public safety."
To Croatian Americans, he said, "You believe in family, you believe in business, and you believe in public safety."
And to Kazakh Americans: "You understand the power of education, you believe in public safety."
Several top aides to Mr. Adams's predecessor, Bill de Blasio, could not recall him leading a flag-raising ceremony to honor a foreign country; Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Michael R. Bloomberg, who served three terms as mayor, said the same.
For Mr. Adams, flag-raisings are a proven audience-pleasing tactic, one that he honed over two terms as Brooklyn borough president, a largely ceremonial position. He has embraced the practice as mayor, with an even broader political purpose in mind.
By honoring as many ethnic groups as possible in this city of immigrants with a flag-raising in the city's oldest park -- by the haunches of the nation's most famous bronze bovine -- Mr. Adams can woo voters in advance of his 2025 re-election bid. In 2021, he won the Democratic primary by just 7,200 votes.
"When you do an analysis of how close our election was," the mayor said at a February flag-raising for Saint Lucia, the birthplace of 10,500 New Yorkers, "you begin to really benefit and understand how 10,000 people unified together can send a powerful message."
That Mr. Adams's office devotes so much effort to this sort of thing has become the subject of bemusement among New York's political class. They acknowledge that the implicit political rationale makes sense, and that it is always fun to attend events where people say nice things about you and honor New York City's diversity. But they argue that the mayor's time is limited, and he is facing no shortage of problems: rampant homelessness, an influx of migrants, an affordable housing crisis, the erosion of the city's tax base.
Indeed, a flag-raising for Belgium was scheduled for an hour after the mayor announced new restrictions on how long asylum seekers could stay in city shelters amid a record-breaking homelessness crisis. A flag-raising for Guyana came the same day the city's first female police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, abruptly resigned because she felt the mayor had undermined her authority.
"As someone who represents a very diverse district, I understand the desire to make every New Yorker feel like their heritage is valued," said Jessica Ramos, a state senator who attended a flag-raising for Colombia last year. "However, at some point it starts to feel like an empty gesture when taken in the context of other things the city should be doing -- filling potholes, picking up trash, funding education."
The flag-raisings persist because, the mayor says, symbolism matters. And what are flags, if not rectangular pieces of cloth embroidered with symbolic and emotional meaning for sizable portions of New York City's electorate.
"He micro-targets," said Richard David, a district leader from Queens who attended the mayor's Guyana flag-raising. "Little things like this for some folks might seem superficial, might feel performative, but if you're a part of this and being seen for the first time, it does mean a lot. And the mayor knows that."
In a statement, Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the mayor, cited the city's multiculturalism and Mr. Adams's career-long dedication to honoring "these different immigrant communities that make up this city." Mr. Levy said that participation by members of the mayor's staff in the flag-raisings was voluntary, and that Mr. Adams took pains to highlight the communities' shared values.
The mayor's flag-raising routine has an identifiable rhythm.
His team cordons off the area where the ceremony will take place, just 13 blocks south of City Hall. The events are often underway by the time the mayor's motorcade arrives. They have something of a pep rally feel.
Typically, a mayoral staff member or close ally steps forward to praise the mayor to a crowd of onlookers with ties to the country whose flag the mayor will hoist. That staff member or ally often has ties to the same country.
When he hoisted the flag for the Philippines in June, Maria Torres-Springer, his Filipina-American deputy mayor for economic development, vouched for the mayor. He "has always been and will always be a true champion of the Filipino community," she said.
When Mr. Adams raised the Bangladeshi flag, his Bangladeshi American chief administrative officer, Mir Bashar, also vouched for the mayor, publicly thanking his boss for "his support and tireless efforts and his commitment to improve the lives of all New Yorkers."
Generally, a consul general attends, alongside representatives from the local community. They often give the mayor gifts: a bracelet, a scarf, a framed painting, socks. He sometimes gives them a mayoral proclamation. Then he repairs to a set of two flag poles, and as the national anthem rings out, he raises the so-called Betsy Ross flag, its circle of 13 stars representing the original U.S. colonies. The foreign national anthem follows, followed by the flag-raising for that nation.
The two flags are each identical in size -- 12 by eight feet. To have flags of different sizes would be a breach of protocol, according to John Hartvigsen, a flag historian and former president of the North American Vexillological Association.
To fly another nation's flag next to the American flag signifies an alliance and honors New York City's diversity, Mr. Hartvigsen said. But putting one on top of the other on the same pole would be bad, he added, signifying one nation conquering the other.
On a blazing hot day in June, Tara Seetaram, a Guyanese American who immigrated to the United States 35 years ago, said the mayor's hoisting of the red-green-and-gold Guyanese flag, known as the Golden Arrowhead, gave her goose bumps.
"It's beautiful," said Ms. Seetaram, who was wearing a flag-themed dress her daughter had bought her on Amazon. "It makes me feel that, you know what, we have representation in New York City."
It was one of the mayor's eight flag-raising ceremonies in June and July. (The others were for Belgium, the Bahamas, Kenya, the Philippines and Italy, as well as in honor of Juneteenth and The Caribbean Community, a organization of 20 member states.)
On Friday, Mr. Adams raised the Bolivian flag; three more flag-raisings were scheduled for the following week, according to Arthur Piccolo, the chairman of the Bowling Green Association. In his comments on Friday, the mayor seemed eager to defend his presence. He said the events carried a symbolic message to people who left their countries for New York. "I appreciate what you bring to the city," he said.
Mr. Piccolo said he has been raising flags at the two flag poles since the second flagpole was installed in 1996 -- a gift, he said, from the Greek community.
Since then, Mr. Adams has been the only mayor to participate in a flag-raising ceremony at the Bowling Green site, Mr. Piccolo said, asserting that it "was too inconsequential for any previous mayor to care about this."
After The New York Times contacted Mr. Piccolo, he sent an email to the mayor and his chief adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, praising Mr. Adams for establishing a new tradition he believed future mayors will uphold. Then he forwarded the email to The Times.
"Your dedication and commitment to this simple yet powerful symbolism have not gone unnoticed, and I believe it exemplifies a very, very good use of your time as the mayor of our great city," Mr. Piccolo wrote.

For Some Birders, Listening Is Everything: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For some blind birders, avian soundscapes are a way to map the world around them. Increasing noise pollution is imperiling that navigation.
On an average morning, Susan Glass can sit on the patio at her condominium complex in Saratoga, Calif., and identify as many as 15 different bird species by ear: a steller's jay, an acorn woodpecker, an oak titmouse.
For her, birding is more than a hobby. "Birds are my eyesight," said Ms. Glass, a poet and a professor of English at West Valley Community College who has been blind since birth. "When I check into a hotel in Pittsburgh, I might remember the rock dove and the house finch in the parking lot, rather than the architecture."
Ms. Glass, 67, was a child when she first noticed the birds twittering outside her family's home on the Lake Erie coast of Michigan. "My mother told me they were a swallow called the purple martin," she said. "I was paying attention to where they were flying, and I could actually start to hear the dimensions of our little cabin, the screen porch, the front yard."
She has mapped her surroundings by bird song ever since.
Birding got a significant boost with the pandemic: With so many people doing less, they tuned in to the sounds of nature more; and with lockdowns came a reduction in noise pollution, which made the bird calls all the more pronounced.
Dr. Sarah Courchesne, a Massachusetts Audubon program ornithologist in Newburyport, attributes the increased interest in birding partly to the fact that it's a way for people of all abilities to tap into nature -- whether by eye, by ear or both.
As the birding community grows larger and more diverse, Dr. Courchesne said, birding clubs and conservation organizations are thinking more about accessibility, and this is changing the way they talk about birding and think about it.
For one thing, the terminology is evolving. According to Freya McGregor, a 35-year-old birder and occupational therapist specializing in blindness and low vision, the term "birder" was once reserved for those who were more serious than the hobbyist "bird watcher." But increasingly, "birder" is becoming a catchall, thanks to a growing awareness that some hobbyists identify birds not by watching, but exclusively by listening.
Spaces are evolving too. Nature trails from Cape Cod to the Colombian Andes are being reimagined, with features like wheelchair-accessible terrain and guardrails to guide guests with low vision. The Audubon Society in Massachusetts recently introduced a series of All Person's Trails, which are designed for accessibility.
Public programming is also expanding. Birding organizations across the country are introducing a new kind of bird "walk" -- one called a "big sit," where you just stay put. These stationary birding events, popularized by the New Haven Birding Club in the early 1990s, is a type of competitive event, sometimes hosted as a fund-raiser, in which teams of birders stay within their own 17-foot-diameter circles for a 24-hour period and identify as many birds as possible.
In May, Dr. Courchesne hosted a big sit alongside Jerry Berrier, a blind birder, on an All Person's Trail near Ipswich, Mass. Mr. Berrier, who lives in Malden, Mass., said he wanted his event to be less competitive and more meditative than a traditional bird sit.
While some studies have shown that simply hearing bird song may alleviate anxiety and boost feelings of well-being, Mr. Berrier, 70, said the benefits go beyond that for him. "Birding gives me a connection with a world I can't see," he said, including when the world outside is waking up in the morning and winding down at dusk.
He doesn't even need to step outside to listen. Mr. Berrier's home is surrounded by an audio mixer and sound recording equipment -- parabolic microphones and devices he has custom-made -- piping in bird sounds from the outdoors in real time, and recording bird song in quieter environments.
At the Ipswich bird sit, Mr. Berrier pointed people to the resonant song of an ovenbird; the buzzy trills of various warblers and the flutelike notes of a Baltimore oriole, which sometimes sounds like it's saying: "Here; here; come right here, dear."
When teaching newcomers how to distinguish birds by ear, Mr. Berrier often shares mnemonics. For the eastern towhee, he said, listen for a bird that tweets: "Drink yer teeeeea." The American robin sounds like it's singing, "Cheer up, cheerily." The Northern cardinal might be saying, 'Watch here, watch here."' American goldfinches call "potato chip" in flight, while olive-sided flycatchers chirp, "Quick! Three beers!"
Mr. Berrier has been birding since the 1970s, when he was in college at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania. There, a professor gave him a special assignment to replace the dissection-based portion of his biology course.
"He ended up giving me probably one of the greatest gifts that's ever been given to me by recommending that I listen to his record albums from Cornell University that had bird sounds on them," Mr. Berrier said. "He said, 'I want you to listen to these during the semester, and at the end, your lab portion of the grade is going to be based on a walk in the woods with me, and I will ask you to identify some of the sounds you hear."'
At first, Mr. Berrier found it daunting to distinguish bird species in the wild just by their sounds. "I just thought, 'Man, these birds all sound the same,"' he said. "But by the end of the semester, I was hooked, and I've been doing it ever since."
During these early outings, Mr. Berrier identified cardinals, with their laserlike trills; robins with their cheery twittering; and red-winged blackbirds, whose call he still thinks of as "a harbinger of spring."
'A Bird Heard'
For birders looking to build out their "life list" of every bird they've ever spotted, knowing these calls can be indispensable: The American Birding Association's rules for identifying a bird species make no qualitative distinction between "a bird heard" and "a bird seen."
Trevor Attenberg, a scientist and writer who is blind and lives in Portland, Ore., pointed out there are plenty of birds you have far less chance of seeing than hearing. "Something like 60 to 70 percent of the birds that you will encounter, you will only be able to encounter by ear," Mr. Attenberg said.
"I'm always listening to what kind of birds I can hear in any given environment, whenever I step outside, and it tells me so much," he said. "It tells me about the weather, and the seasons. It tells me about this specific landscape that I'm in. Even when I'm in urban environments, it can tell me about the quality of habitat."
Learning the percentage of birds that one might only ever have a chance to identify by ear gave Mr. Attenberg, 40, more confidence. "It's indicating to me -- as the blind birder, uncertain as to my place in science -- that I actually can compete with other ornithologists that can spot birds through binoculars and so forth, which I can't really do," he said. "Learning that, in fact, such a large share of possible bird detections are only going to come through the ear, tells me that, well, there is room for blind people -- and people that just enjoy using their ears for listening or collecting information -- to learn about birds in this way."
Birders don't need to memorize every call: Birding apps like BirdNET or the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Merlin Bird ID can record bird sounds in the wild and help a listener identify the species.
But the notion of "a bird heard" is becoming increasingly imperiled as noise pollution brings about fundamental changes in the way nature sounds. Ornithologists have reported birds changing the tenor of their calls as they strain to be audible over the din of human-made noise -- whether it's crypto mining or just the everyday sounds of leaf blowers or car traffic.
Ms. Glass, the poet in California, said she has noticed that, over time, there are fewer bird sounds altogether. "There is no longer, in my part of the world, what you would call a dawn chorus -- an overwhelming bird chorus that drowns out everything else," she said. Bird song ebbs and flows with the seasons, peaking during migrations. But studies indicate that as bird populations decline, bird song is declining, too.
5,400 Birds
Michael Hurben, 56, is on a mission to document what he can, while he can. Because of a degenerative retina disease, his field of view has narrowed over time, from 180 degrees to, he estimates, less than one-tenth of that.
So Mr. Hurben, a retired engineer who lives in Bloomington, Minn., has doubled down on his love of birding, and is well on his way to identifying 5,400 different birds -- a little more than half of all bird species in the world. "I just want to be able to say that I've identified the majority," he said.
He and his wife, Claire Strohmeyer, who is also 56 and a clinical researcher, have visited dozens of international destinations to check rare species off the list. But a narrow scope makes searching for a bird in a tree, or spotting it through binoculars, especially challenging.
This makes his ability to identify birds by ear indispensable. He has brushed up on his skills online, but also by birding with other birders by ear, including Mr. Berrier, who joined Mr. Hurben on a birding trip to Cape May, N.J., last year.
Mr. Hurben finds it increasingly difficult to hear certain bird song, like the very high-pitched calls of the colorful cedar waxwing.
"Before we go on a trip, I will try to really study the calls ahead of time," he said. While some calls do require a mnemonic to remember, others are very distinctive.
He cited for example, the screaming piha, a plain-looking gray bird he and his wife trekked into the Amazon to identify. Its unique call is a go-to for sound designers when making films set in jungles, he said. (Listen for it in Werner Herzog's 1972 film, "Aguirre, Wrath of God.") Likewise, another South American bird, the sharpbill, has a call that sounds "like a falling bomb," Mr. Hurben said. "I hear that song once, and I'll never forget it the rest of my life."

A.I.'s Inroads in Publishing Touch Off Fear, and Creativity: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The technology has the potential to affect nearly every aspect of how books are produced -- even the act of writing itself.
The arrival of Amazon reshaped the retail landscape for books. The rise of e-books threatened the printed word. And the boom in self publishing gave writers a path to success that left out traditional publishing houses. Each time, the book business was able to adapt.
Now, publishing is facing a new disruption that is likely to be far more wide-ranging and transformative: the rise of artificial intelligence.
Some in the publishing world are already experimenting with artificial intelligence programs in areas such as marketing, advertising, audiobook production and even writing, weighing their promise of supporting work done by humans against the threat that the machines may take over some of those jobs entirely.
For others in the industry, the threat is already here. Writers have joined other artists, coders and content creators in suing A.I. companies, accusing them of using their work to train A.I. systems. The writers don't want their work used without permission -- especially since the technology can power chatbots such as ChatGPT, which can generate surprisingly evocative text, mimic well-known authors or even spit out whole novels after following prompts from a skilled human.
"It's urgent for writers to engage with the issue of A.I.," said the novelist Hari Kunzru, who recently signed a contract with Knopf for his next two books and specified in the agreement that the works could not be used to train A.I. "Right now, literary writers are less at risk than some, but there's nothing to say that won't change with the release of the next generation of models."
Over the past few months, the technology made rapid inroads seemingly everywhere -- in classrooms, hospitals, courtrooms and even in Hollywood, where screenwriters walked out on strike demanding better pay, but also protections against the rise of A.I.
In publishing, too, the technology has the potential to reshape nearly every aspect of the work that goes into producing a book -- even the act of writing itself.
"The entire marketplace is going to be affected," said Mary Rasenberger, the chief executive of the Authors Guild. "I wouldn't be surprised if A.I. got pretty good at some kinds of genre fiction in the not too distant future."
Many in publishing are taking action to protect their work. The Authors Guild recently organized a petition signed by thousands of writers demanding that companies seek their approval before using their work to train A.I. programs. Agencies representing illustrators have also revised their contracts to keep their work from being used to feed A.I. programs. Penguin Random House, the country's largest book publisher, said it considers the "unauthorized ingestion" of content to train A.I. models to be a copyright infringement.
At the same time, there's already been a boom in publishing start-ups that are tapping artificial intelligence to create, package, edit and market books, said Thad McIlroy, an industry analyst who has studied the impact of A.I., and tracked nearly 50 such companies.
Among the start-ups are Stockimg, which can produce book covers; Storywizard, a program that creates children's stories; Subtxt, which acts as a writing coach by helping authors expand on a concept or develop characters; and Laika, an A.I. program that claims to mimic the prose of writers like Jane Austen and Edgar Allan Poe.
Large publishing companies are experimenting with the technology too, though in less overt ways, McIlroy said. "People are being quite secretive about it," he said. "Big publishers are very worried from a legal perspective, and worried about author relations if they admit that they're using these tools."
The author and journalist Stephen Marche worked with three A.I. programs to produce a book called "Death of an Author," which was published this year. He ran a plot outline and extensive plot points through one program. Next, he changed the tone, length and style of the writing with another. Then he used another program to elevate the language in individual sentences.
"To me, it's the most fascinating, creative tool around," Marche said.
Some authors are using A.I. as a writing and editing assistant that can help them brainstorm, organize material, develop characters or create an outline.
"Every writer I know is exploring how A.I. can help them," said Josh Bernoff, a business writer who uses ChatGPT to summarize information and suggest ways to rephrase passages. But he would never use it to generate text, he said, for a simple reason: "The resulting prose is boring."
Amit Gupta, a founder of Sudowrite, which harnesses A.I. to write texts based on user prompts, said that traditionally published authors have access to teams who help them produce their best work. The company, which has 10,000 paying users, aims to offer that kind of help to more writers, he said.
"Other artists, whether it's photographers, videographers or musicians," he said, "have these really powerful tools on their computers to help them make the art that they make."
Some of the resistance among publishers to works generated by A.I. comes from its legal standing: Machine-written text can't be copyrighted. If it was then modified by humans, it may be eligible, but that would be decided on a case-by-case basis, according to the U.S. Copyright Office.
That makes A.I. generated work much less appealing to publishers, which don't generally want to buy a book they can't exclusively license and sell, publishing executives said.
But finding writers -- even writers willing to work for very little or for free -- has never been a problem for publishers. The industry's most pressing challenge is making readers aware of the books it does publish, a task that has gotten much more difficult in recent years.
News media outlets that cover books have dwindled, and more readers are shopping for books online, where they're less likely to encounter a title they've heard nothing about. Many in the industry said they fear that a flood of A.I.-generated content could make it harder for traditionally written books to be discovered.
"The challenge for publishers is not generating more content, it's solving the discovery problem," said Madeline McIntosh, the former chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S. "That's really where the gold mine is."
A.I.-powered programs are already being used to try to solve that problem, helping readers find a greater array of books. Open Road Integrated Media, which provides marketing services to publishers, announced recently that it will use the technology to continually optimize the metadata behind individual titles, so they appear more prominently in search engines and on retail websites.
And A.I. is transforming the production of audiobooks, a rapidly growing and lucrative format for publishers.
Apple and Google both have programs that turn e-books into audiobooks for free using text-to-voice technology. Newer companies, including DeepZen and Speechki, are producing thousands of audiobooks with synthetic narration.
Judy Chang, the director of product for Google Play Books, said they are targeting titles that otherwise would not be made into audiobooks, including those that are self published or published by academic presses.
"This is trying to create a catalog for all those books that get left behind," she said. That includes titles in other languages: Google now offers synthetic narration in Spanish, French, German and Brazilian Portuguese.
The biggest publishing companies still use human narrators. Audible, a leading audiobook producer and retailer, doesn't use A.I. narration or sell synthetic audiobooks on its platform, the company said. But while it plans to continue to rely on professionals -- Audible has worked with more than 600,000 authors and narrators -- it also sees the potential for human performances and text-to-speech generated content to coexist.
Some worry that inevitably, audiobook narrators, like workers across the industry, will be at risk of being replaced by machines.
"The pitfalls are that people will lose work," said Michele Cobb, the executive director of the Audio Publishers Association. "Technology is not going to stop."
Photograph Stephen Marche, who used A.I. to allow "Aidan Marchine" to write a book, said it is a "fascinating, creative tool." This article appeared in print on page BU7.

‘Birds Are My Eyesight’

On an average morning, Susan Glass can sit on the patio at her condominium complex in Saratoga, California, and identify as many as 15 different bird species by ear: a Steller’s jay, an acorn woodpecker, an oak titmouse.
For her, birding is more than a hobby. “Birds are my eyesight,” said Glass, a poet and an English professor at West Valley Community College who has been blind since birth. “When I check into a hotel in Pittsburgh, I might remember the rock dove and the house finch in the parking lot, rather than the architecture.”
Glass, 67, was a child when she first noticed the birds twittering outside her family’s home on the Lake Erie coast of Michigan. “My mother told me they were a swallow called the purple martin,” she said. “I was paying attention to where they were flying, and I could actually start to hear the dimensions of our little cabin, the screen porch, the front yard.”
She has mapped her surroundings by bird song ever since.
Birding got a significant boost with the pandemic: With so many people doing less, they tuned in to the sounds of nature more; and with lockdowns came a reduction in noise pollution, which made the bird calls all the more pronounced.
Sarah Courchesne, a Massachusetts Audubon Society program ornithologist in Newburyport, attributes the increased interest in birding partly to the fact that it’s a way for people of all abilities to tap into nature — whether by eye, by ear or by both.
As the birding community grows larger and more diverse, Courchesne said, birding clubs and conservation organizations are thinking more about accessibility, and this is changing the way they talk about birding and think about it.
For one thing, the terminology is evolving. According to Freya McGregor, a 35-year-old birder and occupational therapist specializing in blindness and low vision, the term “birder” was once reserved for those who were more serious than the hobbyist “bird watcher.” But increasingly, “birder” is becoming a catchall, thanks to a growing awareness that some hobbyists identify birds exclusively by listening.
All Persons Trails
Spaces are evolving too. Nature trails from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to the Colombian Andes are being re-imagined, with features such as wheelchair-accessible terrain and guardrails to guide guests with low vision. The Massachusetts Audubon Society recently introduced a series of All Persons Trails, which are designed for accessibility.
Public programming is also expanding. Birding organizations across the country are introducing a new kind of bird “walk” — one called a “big sit,” where you just stay put. These stationary birding events, made popular by the New Haven Birding Club in the early 1990s, is a type of competitive event, sometimes hosted as a fundraiser, in which teams of birders stay within their own 17-foot-diameter circles for 24 hours and identify as many birds as possible.
In May, Courchesne hosted a big sit alongside Jerry Berrier, a blind birder, on an All Persons Trail near Ipswich, Massachusetts. Berrier, who lives in Malden, Massachusetts, said he wanted his event to be less competitive and more meditative than a traditional bird sit.
Although some studies have shown that simply hearing bird song may alleviate anxiety and boost feelings of well-being, Berrier, 70, said the benefits went beyond that for him. “Birding gives me a connection with a world I can’t see,” he said, including when the world outside is waking up in the morning and winding down at dusk.
He doesn’t even need to step outside to listen. Berrier’s home is surrounded by an audio mixer and sound recording equipment — parabolic microphones and devices he has custom-made — piping in bird sounds from the outdoors in real time, and recording bird song in quieter environments.
At the Ipswich bird sit, Berrier pointed people to the resonant song of an ovenbird; the buzzy trills of warblers; and the flutelike notes of a Baltimore oriole, which sometimes sounds like it’s saying, “Here; here; come right here, dear.”
When teaching newcomers how to distinguish birds by ear, Berrier often shares mnemonics. For the eastern towhee, he said, listen for a bird that tweets: “Drink yer teeeeea.” The American robin sounds like it’s singing, “Cheer up, cheerily.” The Northern cardinal might be saying, “Watch here, watch here.” In flight, American goldfinches call, “Potato chip,” while olive-sided flycatchers chirp, “Quick! Three beers!”
Berrier has been birding since the 1970s, when he was in college at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania. There, a professor gave him a special assignment to replace the dissection-based portion of his biology course.
“He ended up giving me probably one of the greatest gifts that’s ever been given to me by recommending that I listen to his record albums from Cornell University that had bird sounds on them,” Berrier said. “He said, ‘I want you to listen to these during the semester, and at the end, your lab portion of the grade is going to be based on a walk in the woods with me, and I will ask you to identify some of the sounds you hear.’”
At first, Berrier found it daunting to distinguish bird species in the wild just by their sounds. “I just thought, ‘Man, these birds all sound the same,’” he said. “But by the end of the semester, I was hooked, and I’ve been doing it ever since.”
During these early outings, Berrier identified cardinals, with their laserlike trills; robins, with their cheery twittering; and red-winged blackbirds, whose call he still thinks of as “a harbinger of spring.”
‘A Bird Heard’
For birders looking to expand their “life list” of every bird they’ve ever spotted, knowing these calls can be indispensable: The American Birding Association’s rules for identifying a bird species make no qualitative distinction between “a bird heard” and “a bird seen.”
Trevor Attenberg, a scientist and writer who is blind and lives in Portland, Oregon, pointed out there were plenty of birds you had far less chance of seeing than hearing. “Something like 60 to 70% of the birds that you will encounter, you will only be able to encounter by ear,” Attenberg said.
“I’m always listening to what kind of birds I can hear in any given environment, whenever I step outside, and it tells me so much,” he said. “It tells me about the weather, and the seasons. It tells me about this specific landscape that I’m in. Even when I’m in urban environments, it can tell me about the quality of habitat.”
Learning the percentage of birds that one might only ever have a chance to identify by ear gave Attenberg, 40, more confidence. “It’s indicating to me — as the blind birder, uncertain as to my place in science — that I actually can compete with other ornithologists that can spot birds through binoculars and so forth, which I can’t really do,” he said. “Learning that, in fact, such a large share of possible bird detections are only going to come through the ear, tells me that, well, there is room for blind people — and people that just enjoy using their ears for listening or collecting information — to learn about birds in this way.”
Birders don’t need to memorize every call: Birding apps such as BirdNET or the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s Merlin Bird ID can record bird sounds in the wild and help a listener identify the species.
But the notion of “a bird heard” is becoming increasingly imperiled as noise pollution brings about fundamental changes in the way nature sounds. Ornithologists have reported birds changing the tenor of their calls as they strain to be audible over the din of human-made noise — whether it’s crypto mining or just the everyday sounds of leaf blowers or car traffic.
Glass said she had noticed that, over time, there were fewer bird sounds altogether. “There is no longer, in my part of the world, what you would call a dawn chorus — an overwhelming bird chorus that drowns out everything else,” she said. Bird song ebbs and flows with the seasons, peaking during migrations. But studies indicate that as bird populations decline, bird song declines, too.
Identifying 5,400 Species
Michael Hurben, 56, hopes to document what he can while he can. Because of a degenerative retina disease, his field of view has narrowed over time, from 180 degrees to, he estimates, less than one-tenth of that.
So, Hurben, a retired engineer who lives in Bloomington, Minnesota, has doubled down and is on his way to identifying 5,400 different birds — about half of the world’s bird species. “I just want to be able to say that I’ve identified the majority,” he said.

The Images Are Artificial. The Fear of the Actors Is Real.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The technology for morphing flesh-and-blood performers into virtual avatars has been improving for years. Now it has become an issue in the actors' strike.
To pack three seasons' worth of English soccer stadiums with exasperated or exhilarated crowds, the Apple TV+ comedy "Ted Lasso" turned to dozens of background actors and powerful visual effects technology.
Using a technique known as crowd tiling, the company Barnstorm VFX helped film groups of extras in one alignment before rearranging them and filming them again, and then cutting and pasting the various groupings to fill all the seats. The show's makers also used crowd sprites, in which actors were filmed individually on green screens and then arranged to appear as part of the crowd. There were even digital doubles: three-dimensional models whose movements were informed by a motion actor.
Innovations in digital technology and artificial intelligence have transformed the increasingly sophisticated world of visual effects, which can ever more convincingly draw from, replicate and morph flesh-and-blood performers into virtual avatars. Those advancements have thrust the issue toward the top of the grievances cited in the weekslong strike by the actors' union.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors, fears that a proposal from Hollywood studios calling for performers to consent to use of their digital replicas at "initial employment" could result in its members' voice intonations, likenesses and bodily movements being scanned and used in different contexts without extra compensation.
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's chief negotiator, said it would be impossible for actors to provide informed consent without knowing how their digital replicas would be used in a cinematic universe or, in some cases, unknown future projects.
"That's really abusive," he said, "and not an OK way for companies to deal with somebody's image, likeness or persona. It's like owning a person."
In an explanation on its website, the union says its counterproposals include guarantees for "informed consent and fair compensation when a 'digital replica' is made or our performance is changed using A.I."
A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that negotiates for the studios, disputed the union's characterization of its proposal. The alliance's position would "only permit a studio to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed," the spokesman, Scott Rowe, said in an emailed statement. "Any other use requires the background actor's consent and bargaining for the use, subject to a minimum payment."
There were 17,000 active members of the union who performed background work in the last year, and more than 80,000 who have done it at some point in their careers, according to union figures. Background actors receive a daily rate of $ 187 for an eight-hour day.
Jennifer E. Rothman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's law school who specializes in intellectual property, said that if limits on digital replicas were not hammered out at the bargaining table, lower-profile performers might not realistically be able to say no to studio demands.
"It's the up-and-comers and the extras who won't have any leverage," she said.
Lawson Deming, a visual effects supervisor and a co-founder of Barnstorm, echoed that view. Famous actors will be able to negotiate into their contracts that they own their likenesses, he said, but a vast majority of the SAG-AFTRA membership will not be so lucky.
"It's not a question of technology," he said. "It's a question of who has the power in the relationship."
That is partly because the technology is already here.
Such scenarios can sound like science fiction, but "performances" by the past selves of aged or even deceased actors have helped carry movies like 2016's "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story." Aided by motion capture recorded on a different actor, Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, reprised his role as Grand Moff Tarkin from the original 1977 "Star Wars" film. (His estate gave permission.)
"Digital humans have been part of the visual effects process for quite a while now -- about 20 years," said Paul Franklin, a visual effects supervisor at DNEG.
Initially they were created for what Franklin called "digital stunt doubles," replicas of actors for stunts that were so death-defying or impossible that real-life stunt doubles would not do them. In one case, he helped a digital replica of the actor Henry Cavill fly as Superman in 2013's "Man of Steel."
Doing such work often involves a practice known as photogrammetry, in which many photographs of something physically real -- like an actor's head -- can be used to digitally reconstruct it in three dimensions.
Technical wizardry is also used to build crowd scenes like the ones in "Ted Lasso." For 2012's "The Dark Knight Rises," Franklin used digital techniques to fill the nearly 70,000 seats at Pittsburgh's professional football stadium with just 11,000 extras.
Bob Wiatr, a visual effects compositor, was instrumental in filling out crowd scenes for "Daisy Jones & the Six," a limited series on Amazon that had its debut this year. In one scene in which the camera, angled behind the titular rock band, looks onto the crowd, real background actors occupy the front rows, while computer-generated avatars fill up the rest.
"Sometimes there are people that are recognizable in the front," Wiatr said, referring to other projects, "and they decide they want to do it from another angle later after they've already shot the scene, so they recreate the shot, and then usually you have 3-D-generated people -- a lot of software can make it."
That does not mean, however, that the task is simple or cheap. Deming of Barnstorm cautioned that concerns over reusing actors' digital scans might be overblown.
"It is very complex to digitally take a scan of someone and make it animatable, make it look realistic, make it functional," he said, though he allowed that "we're making very big leaps."
The biggest leaps are now being made in artificial intelligence. Last month the comedian Sarah Silverman joined class-action lawsuits against the companies OpenAI and Meta, accusing them of using her copyrighted written work to train their artificial intelligence models. SAG-AFTRA is concerned about something similar happening to actors' performances.
Linsay Rousseau, a voice actor and performance capture artist, said performers were fearful of a future in which artificial intelligence reduces or eliminates roles for humans.
"We're worried," she said, "that we go in and record a session, they then take it, synthesize that voice, and don't call us back. Or they process them to create new voices and thus do not call actors in to do that work."
One visual effects company, Digital Domain, said in a statement that in the past five years it had used A.I. to "greatly accelerate" and "increase the accuracy" of digital avatars based on background actors.
"Machine learning is used to create a library of all possible facial shapes of a given actor, or the possible deformations of a piece of clothing or a set of muscles," the statement said. "This library is then used to create a lifelike digital version of what was captured. We also have the technology now where we can create performances of historical figures based on existing footage."
Franklin, a two-time Oscar winner for his visual effects work on "Inception" and "Interstellar," said it was clear that technology had advanced beyond the scope of typical industry contracts.
"I think it is a valid concern," he said. "People think, 'Well, what's going to happen to this data? How's it going to be used in the future?"'

Full text: The popular Netflix legal thriller just released a batch of new episodes. In an interview, Ted Humphrey, one of the showrunners, discusses Season 2 and what every good lawyer show needs.
This interview includes spoilers for the second season of "The Lincoln Lawyer."
Ted Humphrey has learned a few things about what it takes to keep a successful series going. A former lawyer, Humphrey worked on 135 episodes of the critically acclaimed CBS show "The Good Wife," with writing credits on 19 of them and titles that included executive producer.
He's now trying to apply some of the same magic to "The Lincoln Lawyer," the legal thriller he created with David E. Kelley last year, based on the Michael Connelly book series.
The inaugural season, starring Manuel Garcia-Rulfo in the title role, was a hit for Netflix. "Higher expectations are a mixed bag," said Humphrey, 53, who shared showrunning duties in Season 2 with Dailyn Rodriguez. "I'm not always thrilled about them, to be honest," he continued, laughing.
He needn't worry. Season 2 -- which Netflix rolled out in two batches of five episodes each, with the second half premiering on Thursday -- confirmed that the streamer has a global hit on its hands. "The Lincoln Lawyer" has been among its most-watched shows worldwide since the first new episodes were released on July 6.
Each season is inspired by one of Connelly's books about Mickey Haller, a Los Angeles defense lawyer working out of his car -- hence his nickname. (Different Connelly novels have inspired the Amazon series "Bosch" and "Bosch: Legacy.") The new installment is based on "The Fifth Witness," published in 2011, and tracks Haller's efforts on behalf of a woman he'd just started seeing, Lisa Trammell (Lana Parilla), after she is accused of killing a developer whose plans were threatening her restaurant.
Devoted Connelly readers will have spotted four deviations from the book in the previous sentence alone: In the novel, Trammell's name is spelled differently, she doesn't have a relationship with Haller, and both she and the victim have other occupations. The author himself has embraced changes to his work.
"What I am most pleased and proud of with 'The Lincoln Lawyer' is that Ted has overseen the updating of 10-to-15-year-old novels to very contemporary stories without sacrificing one bit of the character of Mickey Haller and his cohorts," Connelly wrote in an email.
In a video chat from Los Angeles, where the series is set and shot, Humphrey discussed such divergences as well as the secrets to a good legal show. These are edited excerpts from the conversation and a follow-up email exchange.
Why did you make Lisa a restaurateur instead of teacher?
In "The Fifth Witness," the client is a woman who is having her home foreclosed upon by a mortgage banker in the wake of the 2008 mortgage crisis. We updated that to something that felt more relevant to Los Angeles in 2023, which was, first of all, the ongoing gentrification debates and then the world of foodie culture and celebrity chefs.
Is it also a good way to anchor the show in Los Angeles without the obligatory shots of the Hollywood sign?
We love to showcase different communities, different neighborhoods of L.A. The restaurant is in a neighborhood called Frogtown, where some of these gentrification concerns are being played out in real time. Mickey is a criminal defense lawyer who works out of his car so you just have a natural vehicle, no pun intended, for him to go anywhere in any neighborhood in the city.
But doesn't he work more out of an office in your version?
He still spends at least half his time in that car. For him to have an office was an important thing for the show: You need places to have scenes, places for other characters to be when he is not there.
The other thing is the car itself. While we love it and it is literally like a mobile set that goes around L.A., after a while it gets a bit claustrophobic to shoot in.
Mickey had just started sleeping with Lisa -- which he didn't do in the book -- when she is accused of murder, and yet he takes on her case. The nature of her guilt is also different in the show. Why make those changes?
In part because we did not want Season 2 to feel too much like Season 1 -- the ending felt a little too similar. The moral quandary of whether your client is guilty or not is a quandary that every defense lawyer faces, but at the same time every defense lawyer will tell you it doesn't matter -- you just have to defend to the best of your ability. That kind of goes out the window when it's somebody you have a relationship with. So it was all in the furtherance of thickening this stew and making this as juicy and as interesting as possible.
Season 2 introduces Mickey's mother, played by Angélica María. What does the character add to the show?
I saw a sign on the [Writers Guild of America] picket line the other day that said "A.I. didn't grow up with my mother. Good luck writing that story." I think difficult mothers are universal and relatable. The mother in the show is exactly the mother in the books, except that you never really meet her in the books. She was this actress from Mexico who met [Mickey's] father and it was kind of a May-September relationship that didn't go so well. We just decided to take that and run with it.
Angélica María is essentially this character in real life: She is the grande dame of telenovelas in Mexico, an icon. I think you do get the sense watching these two people that there is a lived history, and you understand the upbringing and what this person dealt with and what Mickey dealt with.
New this season is prosecutor Andrea Freeman, who has a smoking chemistry with Mickey. Can you please tell me that Yaya DaCosta will be back in future seasons?
She is if we're fortunate enough to keep doing it. Andrea as a character does not continue in the books, but we loved Yaya's performance so we just came up with ways to keep that character alive.
Between "The Good Wife" and "The Lincoln Lawyer," you know your way around a TV courtroom. What makes a good legal show?
One, there has to be a gray area where this lawyer is wrestling with moral choices. Robert King, who created "The Good Wife" with Michelle King, used to say that the show was about the education of Alicia Florrick [played by Julianna Margulies]. She got back to work later in life, so you were watching her grow up and realize all the different moral compromises she would have to make.
Two is authenticity: You have to take some liberties because your first job is to tell a dramatic, interesting story. But trials take a year to happen, and things are really fought out as much in motions, witness prep and depositions as they are in the court case.
The third thing is that lawyers are people who have jobs, and their day is consumed with the minor nonsense of day-to-day life. For Mickey, the life of the criminal defense lawyer is one long search for income.
If "The Good Wife" was about the education of Alicia Florrick, what's the overarching concept for "The Lincoln Lawyer"?
I think it's a redemption story. You meet Mickey Haller in Season 1 and he is a broken man who's lost everything, who has been humbled by a drug addiction. The show, to some extent, is about his journey not just back but beyond, and it's also about him coming to terms with who he is: this child of privilege on one side and an immigrant mother on the other side.
What's next for the show?
Right now it depends not only on how Season 2 does, but also on the resolution of the strikes. We had to shut down our writers' room for Season 3 when the Writers Guild contract expired. We've done Michael Connelly picket events where Michael and the staff from "The Lincoln Lawyer" and "Bosch" have picketed together. We're out there because the issues are real and have to be resolved, and the only way that's going to happen is by the companies sitting back down with us to make a fair deal. Hopefully that happens soon, and once it does, we will be back to work on a third season.

Digital Replicas, a Fear of Striking Actors, Already Fill Screens

To pack three seasons’ worth of English soccer stadiums with exasperated or exhilarated crowds, the Apple TV+ comedy “Ted Lasso” turned to dozens of background actors and powerful visual effects technology.
Using a technique known as crowd tiling, the company Barnstorm VFX helped film groups of extras in one alignment before rearranging them and filming them again, and then cutting and pasting the various groupings to fill all the seats. The show’s makers also used crowd sprites, in which actors were filmed individually on green screens and then arranged to appear as part of the crowd. There were even digital doubles: three-dimensional models whose movements were informed by a motion actor.
Innovations in digital technology and artificial intelligence have transformed the increasingly sophisticated world of visual effects, which can ever more convincingly draw from, replicate and morph flesh-and-blood performers into virtual avatars. Those advancements have thrust the issue toward the top of the grievances cited in the weekslong strike by the actors’ union.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors, fears that a proposal from Hollywood studios calling for performers to consent to use of their digital replicas at “initial employment” could result in its members’ voice intonations, likenesses and bodily movements being scanned and used in different contexts without extra compensation.
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA’s chief negotiator, said it would be impossible for actors to provide informed consent without knowing how their digital replicas would be used in a cinematic universe or, in some cases, unknown future projects.
“That’s really abusive,” he said, “and not an OK way for companies to deal with somebody’s image, likeness or persona. It’s like owning a person.”
In an explanation on its website, the union says its counterproposals include guarantees for “informed consent and fair compensation when a ‘digital replica’ is made or our performance is changed using AI.”
A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that negotiates for the studios, disputed the union’s characterization of its proposal. The alliance’s position would “only permit a studio to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed,” the spokesman, Scott Rowe, said in an emailed statement. “Any other use requires the background actor’s consent and bargaining for the use, subject to a minimum payment.”
There were 17,000 active members of the union who performed background work in the last year, and more than 80,000 who have done it at some point in their careers, according to union figures. Background actors receive a daily rate of $187 for an eight-hour day.
Jennifer E. Rothman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school who specializes in intellectual property, said that if limits on digital replicas were not hammered out at the bargaining table, lower-profile performers might not realistically be able to say no to studio demands.
“It’s the up-and-comers and the extras who won’t have any leverage,” she said.
Lawson Deming, a visual effects supervisor and a co-founder of Barnstorm, echoed that view. Famous actors will be able to negotiate into their contracts that they own their likenesses, he said, but a vast majority of the SAG-AFTRA membership will not be so lucky.
“It’s not a question of technology,” he said. “It’s a question of who has the power in the relationship.”
That is partly because the technology is already here.
Such scenarios can sound like science fiction, but “performances” by the past selves of aged or even deceased actors have helped carry movies like 2016’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Aided by motion capture recorded on a different actor, Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, reprised his role as Grand Moff Tarkin from the original 1977 “Star Wars” film. (His estate gave permission.)
“Digital humans have been part of the visual effects process for quite a while now — about 20 years,” said Paul Franklin, a visual effects supervisor at DNEG.
Initially they were created for what Franklin called “digital stunt doubles,” replicas of actors for stunts that were so death-defying or impossible that real-life stunt doubles would not do them. In one case, he helped a digital replica of actor Henry Cavill fly as Superman in 2013’s “Man of Steel.”
Doing such work often involves a practice known as photogrammetry, in which many photographs of something physically real — like an actor’s head — can be used to digitally reconstruct it in three dimensions.
Technical wizardry is also used to build crowd scenes like the ones in “Ted Lasso.” For 2012’s “The Dark Knight Rises,” Franklin used digital techniques to fill the nearly 70,000 seats at Pittsburgh’s professional football stadium with just 11,000 extras.
Bob Wiatr, a visual effects compositor, was instrumental in filling out crowd scenes for “Daisy Jones & the Six,” a limited series on Amazon that had its debut this year. In one scene in which the camera, angled behind the titular rock band, looks onto the crowd, real background actors occupy the front rows, while computer-generated avatars fill up the rest.
“Sometimes there are people that are recognizable in the front,” Wiatr said, referring to other projects, “and they decide they want to do it from another angle later after they’ve already shot the scene, so they recreate the shot, and then usually you have 3D-generated people — a lot of software can make it.”
That does not mean, however, that the task is simple or cheap. Deming of Barnstorm cautioned that concerns over reusing actors’ digital scans might be overblown.
“It is very complex to digitally take a scan of someone and make it animatable, make it look realistic, make it functional,” he said, though he allowed that “we’re making very big leaps.”
The biggest leaps are now being made in artificial intelligence. Last month comedian Sarah Silverman joined class-action lawsuits against the companies OpenAI and Meta, accusing them of using her copyrighted written work to train their artificial intelligence models. SAG-AFTRA is concerned about something similar happening to actors’ performances.
Linsay Rousseau, a voice actor and performance capture artist, said performers were fearful of a future in which artificial intelligence reduces or eliminates roles for humans.
“We’re worried,” she said, “that we go in and record a session, they then take it, synthesize that voice, and don’t call us back. Or they process them to create new voices and thus do not call actors in to do that work.”

Full text: Many eras coexist inside the studio of the Emmy-winning costume designer Donna Zakowska.
Clothes hold a visceral thrill for Donna Zakowska. "There's a sensuality and a tactile aspect to fashion," she said. "I'm always thinking about the quality of the garment, the fabric, the way it plays with light and air and movement -- about the emotional impact of color."
Ms. Zakowska won a 2019 Emmy for designing costumes for "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," and she has just received her fifth nomination for her work on the series. Her passion for her art is instantly palpable to anyone visiting her workshop at the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, where much of the show was filmed.
The space is a vast confectionery of the vibrant 1950s-style fashions she created for "Mrs. Maisel": hats bedecked with jewels or feathers; swing coats in tones of crimson, emerald and teal; racks of suits and blouses. A phalanx of limbless dress forms model some highlights: crinoline-d day dresses splashed with flowers or polka dots; a Tiffany blue suit with a maroon shawl collar; cocktail frocks in periwinkle and gold printed silk, black crepe and palest green satin, all sparingly accessorized with a single chiffon bow or a slim ribbon belt.
Petite, with a cascade of half-pinned-up auburn hair, Ms. Zakowska wore an all-black trouser ensemble by Rei Kawakubo, its artful jacket decomposing into long strips of trailing fabric, like a deconstructed 18th-century tailcoat.
"My go-to look is Japanese, Comme des Garçons or Yohji Yamamoto," she said. "I love the simplicity, the craft, the tailoring of Japanese clothing. It has influenced everything I do -- the formalism of a bow, the idea of a belt." A rope necklace strung with several small wooden objects hung around her neck. "African weaving tools," she explained, "they have very strong energy."
Ms. Zakowska's dedication to research was evident in the shelves lined with fashion history books and in the giant mood boards covered with vintage magazine clippings, fabric swatches and photographs. Some walls in the studio are papered to the ceiling with her costume sketches.
Her official profession is costume designer, but "world creator" may suit Ms. Zakowska better, given her talent for conjuring character, history, place and stories through vivid, meticulously imagined fashion. She herself seems to exist in a kind of liminal space, poised amid the present and the bygone eras she animates on stage and screen, amid the many characters she coaxes into existence, and amid the many art forms she has mastered. Her life has been steeped in nearly all aspects of performance and design.
After graduating from Barnard, she started her career as a professional dancer, having studied Martha Graham and Alvin Ailey technique in New York and Balinese dance in Indonesia. She went on to study painting and drawing at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and then, in the mid-1980s, attended the Yale School of Drama in costume, lighting and set design.
She was an assistant to Woody Allen. She costumed the Big Apple Circus for nine years. She has collaborated and toured with Roman Paska, the renowned puppet artist and director, whom she met in college and is her life partner. And she has worked steadily in theater and film, including many collaborations with John Turturro, her close friend and former Yale roommate. "Working with Donna always makes my performance better," Mr. Turturro said.
In 2008, Ms. Zakowska won an Emmy for her work on "John Adams," the HBO mini-series set in the 18th century. "I was completely awed by the 18th century in clothing," she said. "That was my obsession for a long time."
But she jumped ahead several centuries to costume all five seasons of "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," which became a fashion phenomenon. Vogue analyzed its looks and offered tutorials in recreating them. Bergdorf Goodman installed Midge Maisel-themed windows and an accompanying pop-up store, auctioning off some of Ms. Zakowska's coats to benefit the Fashion Manufacturing Initiative. The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History selected two of Ms. Zakowska's costumes for its collection.
In 2021, she published a thoughtful book about her work on the show. And thousands of "Mrs. Maisel" followers on social media -- both men and women -- devoted themselves to recreating and photographing themselves in favorite costumes, holding "Maisel festivals," a sartorial version of fan fiction. This ability to spur a fashion dialogue finds its roots in Ms. Zakowska's early life and how it informs her design process.
A Bonding Experience
Ms. Zakowska grew up steeped in the communicative pleasures of fashion. Brooklyn-born and raised (she still owns the house where she grew up, in Vinegar Hill), she came from a family of women who loved clothing. "They would shop on the Lower East Side, in these little stores that would have amazing things," she said. "I think of my grandmother and her two daughters going into those stores and buying clothing together."
Pleasure and camaraderie remain at the heart of Ms. Zakowska's work. Costume design is inherently interpersonal, and fittings are delicate in nature. "It's really a bonding experience," Ms. Zakowska said. "Someone is exposing themselves to you. You are half psychologist."
Rachel Brosnahan, who played Midge Maisel, described her relationship with Ms. Zakowska as "symbiotic." Tony Shalhoub, who played Abe Weissman, said, "There was real dialogue with Donna.". Out of these fitting-room experiences characters are born.
"An actor comes in for a fitting, they may have an idea. But if you are inspired and show them images, they suddenly find a root for the character," Ms. Zakowska said.
Beyond dressing them, Ms. Zakowska finds she somehow becomes the characters she helps create. "I have to feel the reality of the character," she said. "You live the characters as a costume designer. You're many people." And in living the characters, Ms. Zakowska may be better able to share them with her actors.
This shape-shifting ability may derive from Ms. Zakowska's background as a performer, but some of her colleagues see something more: a kind of supernatural quality.
Marin Hinkle, who played Rose Weissman on "Mrs. Maisel," felt nearly magically transformed by Ms. Zakowska's costumes and described changing from her costume back into street clothes to find that crew members no longer recognized her. "Something about Rose and Donna, and what it became -- it was a bit magical," she said. "Donna is a little otherworldly."
Caroline Aaron, who played Shirley Maisel on the series, put it succinctly: "Donna is a sorcerer!"
If there is magic in Ms. Zakowska's work, it may reside in the excitement and inspiration she has never stopped finding in color, history, artisanal crafts (she has studied 18th-century men's tailoring in London, silk flower making in Hungary, among other pursuits) and nature. "I love to look at flowers, at things in nature, at insects," she said. She finds clothes and fabric especially captivating: "When a garment is in your hands, you should be as excited as you are when you see it in the distance."
Beyond Mrs. Maisel
This year, the director and choreographer Susan Stroman invited Ms. Zakowska to costume "New York, New York," a Broadway dance musical set in the 1940s. "I first became aware of Donna by watching 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.' Right away, I recognized she was an extraordinary artist," Ms. Stroman said. "Donna understands movement -- how a dress needs to add to the choreography. Her fabrics move so beautifully, it's as if the dancer is flying." It was Ms. Zakowska's first Broadway musical, and it earned her a Tony nomination.
Another dance-related project lies in Ms. Zakowska's future: She will costume "Etoile," a new television series about contemporary French and American ballet dancers, set in Paris, to be produced by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, the creative team behind "Mrs. Maisel." (The writers' and actors' strikes have paused production for the time being.)
For this, Ms. Zakowska will set up shop in Atelier Caraco, a storied costume and haute couture studio tucked away in an old building in Paris, just behind the Folies Bergère. There, in her signature black trousers paired with an embroidered white tuxedo shirt from Mexico, she chatted with Caraco's director, Claudine Lachaud.
A multistory warren of connected studios, all arranged around a small courtyard enclosed by trees strung with lights, Caraco feels like an ideal space for intimate dialogue and collaboration. At the moment, the only other artist there is the couturier Christian Lacroix, who is designing costumes for a new opera. Some of Mr. Lacroix's costume "bibles" lay open on a table.
"I get to see things like Christian Lacroix's boards with all his swatches," Ms. Zakowska said. "Seeing his things is like seeing Dior's things. It's on that level."
Paris holds special meaning for Ms. Zakowska. "I have a long history here, having gone to the Beaux-Arts. She also has a connection to the Caraco studio, where some "Mrs. Maisel" costumes were built, and where her partner, Roman Paska, has had some of his puppet costumes made.
She has already started thinking about the nuances involved in costuming American and French ballet dancers. (Americans, she said, "concentrate on muscle," while French dancers have "more elongation, just a little bit of a more sensual edge.")
Ms. Zakowska would like to write "a costume designer's wellness book," about what she calls the "curative" experience that can occur when you "interpret the human situation with costume."
If there is a therapeutic aspect to what she does, it surely resides in part in how Ms. Zakowska's own pleasure, research and deep investment in her designs get transmitted to viewers and actors. Ms. Aaron said that her 20-something daughter is having some of her costumes resized for herself. "I know a lot of young girls who want to dress like Midge now," Ms. Aaron said.
Marin Hinkle said that she keeps photographs from her Paris costume fittings on her phone, "and when I'm feeling blue, I think, 'I got to go to that costume fitting!"' And Mr. Shalhoub said that he keeps some of his costumes from "Mrs. Maisel" in a special closet in his apartment. He likes "to just open the doors and comb the fabric with my hands. They are like treasures."
Ms. Zakowska understands perfectly the magnetic and transcendent allure that fashion can offer. "Clothes," she said, "can be like an exultation."

A Reassuring Voice on Tech In a World of Upheaval: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mike Masnick, who founded Techdirt in 1998, writes for an influential audience of lawmakers, C.E.O.s and activists. Somehow, he's still an optimist about the promise of technology.
How could they protect themselves from A.I.?
That was the question that Mike Masnick found himself fielding this summer in a WhatsApp chat with about 100 directors, actors and screenwriters. The group, including marquee talent, was worried about a grim possible future in which deepfake versions of actors perform screenplays written by ChatGPT.
Mr. Masnick, a professional tech wonk, told his Hollywood listeners to work with what they had: Publicly shame projects that replace human labor with artificial intelligence, use state publicity laws against any unauthorized deepfakes and fight hard for contractual protections. (The fight is on: A.I. is one reason for the writers' and actors' strikes that have paralyzed the film and television industry.)
But he also suggested that they capitalize on the technology. Convinced that "A.I. plus human" is the future, he pointed to the singer Grimes. She invited people to use A.I.-generated versions of her voice, trained on music that she had done in the past, in exchange for half of any royalties. One GrimesAI song is closing in on a million listens on Spotify.
"Let people be creative and they'll do creative things and expand the interest in your own work," Mr. Masnick, 48, said. The technological shift is inevitable, he said, so "use it to your advantage."
Since starting his Techdirt blog in 1998, Mr. Masnick has been doling out this same message as wave after wave of tech innovation has stirred fears, going back to the time of Napster: The new thing is less scary than you think it is.
He had been added to the Hollywood group chat about A.I. by Alex Winter, an actor and filmmaker whose oeuvre ranges from "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" to documentaries about other alarming technology, including Bitcoin and YouTube. Mr. Winter said he appreciated Mr. Masnick's pragmatism.
"I find people like Mike reassuring because they are setting up guardrails to prevent you from driving your car off the cliff in your zeal to find solutions," he said.
By sheer longevity and a deep knowledge of tech history, Mr. Masnick has become something of a Silicon Valley oracle. His message is to embrace change even when painful and to beware of knee-jerk legal protections with unintended consequences.
It hasn't paid very well, but what Mr. Masnick doesn't have in wealth he makes up for in influence. Lawmakers, activists and executives consider him an essential guide for what's happening in the technology world and what to do next.
"Whenever tech policy news breaks I always want to see what Mike's take is going to be," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, in a statement. Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Meta, has called him "insightful and reasonable." The tech entrepreneur Anil Dash said he "shows up and ships every day" and has been "filing constantly for decades on a beat that is thankless."
What Mr. Masnick apparently hasn't had time for is a redesign of his blog. A wall of text, heavy on hyperlinks, it has not evolved much since its founding.
Intellectual Gig Work
Based just outside Silicon Valley in Redwood City, Calif., with an office view that features tech company commuters and a giant Buddha statue looking down onto U.S. 101, Mr. Masnick started writing online about the "high-tech industry" in the late 1990s while in business school -- mainly as a ploy to get a job at a long-forgotten start-up -- and then never stopped.
In the early 2000s -- a thousand years ago in internet time -- online file-sharing was taking off and CD sales were plummeting. Mr. Masnick exhorted the music industry to accept the internet and the opportunity it offered to connect with more fans. The internet would be great for artists: fewer middlemen and gatekeepers!
The digitization of music didn't go exactly the way Mr. Masnick had hoped. Creators weren't the primary winners; subscription services like Spotify and Apple Music were. But artists who had a direct relationship with their audience did gain more power, as many a Taylor Swift fan can attest.
Mr. Masnick has been a close observer of the tech industry's rise from disruptive force to world-dominating power center, but he has never quite managed to reap its astronomical financial rewards for himself. The best way to describe how he makes a living is as an intellectual gig worker, equal parts business owner, tech journalist, policy analyst, research fellow and game designer.
Techdirt has a handful of employees and paid contributors, almost all selected in meritocratic style from the comments section. Because of Mr. Masnick's commitment to the free flow of information, Techdirt has never had a paywall. Advertising and support from the site's million or so readers have never fully paid his bills.
Mr. Masnick has written more than 51,000 (often lengthy) blog posts, adding more several times a day, and also hosts a weekly podcast. On one Friday this month, he wrote about proposed A.I. regulations (mostly bad, in his opinion), a court's dismissal of a lawsuit against Amazon for selling teenagers "suicide kits" (a tragic case but a good ruling, he concluded), and legal challenges to "crazy" age-verification laws meant to protect children online. (He recently filed a declaration in a lawsuit seeking to stop California from enacting such a law, outlining how burdensome it would be for Techdirt to comply.)
He runs the Copia Institute, a think tank that organizes events about internet policy and produces geeky research reports; it accepts sponsorships from foundations and companies, including ones that Mr. Masnick writes about, such as Google and Yelp. The financial entanglement might get him in trouble at a traditional journalism organization, but not at a blog where he is the boss. Sponsors never have editorial control, he said.
Being a small independent tech blogger, Mr. Masnick said, means "finding that spot where you can survive."
In the last few years, he has taken to game design. He co-created a role-playing exercise for the United Nations to help forecast the future in countries with political upheaval and a game about what it's like to be an online content moderator, sponsored by a start-up advocacy group. Few people would describe them as fun, but Mr. Masnick said they helped people wrap their heads around complicated technology issues like nothing else he had done.
His productivity hacks include a laptop with a slide-out second screen that makes it easy to work on the go and Focusmate, a paid service that pairs him with a stranger so they can silently "co-work" together. At the end of a session, they tell each other whether they accomplished what they set out to do.
In the Heads of Tech C.E.O.s
The message in Mr. Masnick's Facebook Messenger inbox was from the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.
"I don't think we've met," Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in February 2021, "but I've always found your writing insightful and reasonable, even when you're critical of us for making mistakes."
Mr. Masnick, who provided this account, tried to message him back -- but couldn't. Because he and Mr. Zuckerberg weren't Facebook friends, the message was rejected.
Befitting his status as an outsider whom insiders read, Mr. Masnick reached out to someone else at Facebook, and soon Mr. Zuckerberg was back in his DMs apologizing for the "bug."
When they talked by phone, Mr. Zuckerberg asked Mr. Masnick what Facebook was doing wrong. Given his distaste for powerful tech companies that exercise too much control over people's internet experience, Mr. Masnick suggested that Mr. Zuckerberg consider decentralizing.
He talked about a concept he has been pushing called "protocols, not platforms" -- software that is interoperable, like email, so people from different services can interact and outside developers can build on it. This would open up a market for different content filters and algorithms that users could choose from, giving them more control over what they did and didn't see. It would make people like Mr. Zuckerberg less powerful, because his company would be allowing third parties to be the arbiters of online speech, but it could deflect the complaints they got about harmful speech and censorship.
The idea had resonated with Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder, who credited Mr. Masnick as an inspiration for the creation of Bluesky, a Twitter clone that embraced that approach.
Mr. Masnick spent more than an hour on the phone with Mr. Zuckerberg, but wasn't sure if he was really listening -- until last month, when Mr. Zuckerberg launched his own Twitter clone, Threads. The news release emphasized that the plan was to make it a protocol interoperable with other apps, including Mastodon. Mr. Masnick celebrated with a long blog post.
The Streisand Effect
Mr. Masnick has a way of seeding ideas about technology that take root and grow.
In 2005, he wrote about legal threats against a website devoted to amassing urinal photos. (The early internet was a strange place.) The threats, intended to remove information about certain urinal owners, instead created their own news cycle and garnered more attention for the otherwise obscure site.
Mr. Masnick coined a phrase for an attempt to censor information on the internet that backfires: "the Streisand effect."
In 2003, Barbra Streisand sued an aerial photographer who had put photos of her Malibu beach house on his website, causing the little-seen images to go viral. Now the episode is internet lore, and the phrase has its own Wikipedia entry with a long list of examples.
It's a typical Masnickian principle of the internet, gleaned from lengthy observation: Poorly thought-out attempts to solve online problems will make them worse.
"He understands the internet in a deep way that I don't think is common," said Corynne McSherry, legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The digital liberties organization gave Mr. Masnick an award for digital activism in 2017, when fighting a defamation lawsuit almost bankrupted Techdirt.
A man who claimed to have "invented email" had sued Techdirt for $ 15 million over its blog posts questioning those claims. The suit garnered significant media attention; it's not among the examples in the Wikipedia article on the Streisand effect, but it really should be.
Mr. Masnick knew the lawsuit was ridiculous and unlikely to succeed, but the legal bills were a hardship. Techdirt turned to the internet and asked for donations. It got the support it needed, and the suit was eventually settled with no money changing hands.
Mr. Masnick got to continue evangelizing for tech innovation.
"I'm trying to get people to see the world the way I see it," he said. "It's cool when people can do stuff."

Influencers Turn Down Thousands to Protect Hollywood Dreams: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite not being in the actors' union, many content creators are passing up deals to promote films or TV shows because they don't want to be barred from the guild or face online vitriol.
Deanna Giulietti is not in the actors' union, but she turned down $ 28,000 last week because of its strike.
Ms. Giulietti, a 29-year-old content creator with 1.8 million TikTok followers, had received an offer to promote the new season of Hulu's hit show "Only Murders in the Building."
But SAG-AFTRA, as the union is known, recently issued rules stating that any influencer who engages in promotion for one of the Hollywood studios the actors are striking against will be ineligible for membership. (Disney is the majority owner of Hulu.) That gave Ms. Giulietti, who also acts and aspires to one day join the union, reason enough to decline the offer from Influential, a marketing agency working with Hulu.
The union's rule is part of a variety of aggressive tactics that hit at a pivotal moment for Hollywood labor and shows its desire to assert itself in a new era and with a different, mostly younger wave of creative talent.
"I want to be in these Netflix shows, I want to be in the Hulu shows, but we're standing by the writers, we're standing by SAG," Ms. Giulietti said. "People write me off whenever I say I'm an influencer, and I'm like, 'No, I really feel I could be making the difference here."'
That difference comes at a cost. In addition to the Hulu deal, Ms. Giulietti recently declined a $ 5,000 offer from the app TodayTix to promote the Searchlight Pictures movie "Theater Camp." (Disney also owns Searchlight.) She said she was living at home with her parents in Cheshire, Conn., and putting off renting an apartment in New York City while she saw how the strike -- which, along with a writers' strike, could go on for months -- would affect her income.
Representatives for Searchlight and TodayTix did not respond to requests for comment. Hulu and Influential declined to comment.
The last time Hollywood's screen actors and writers went on strike, social media platforms and the $ 5 billion influencer industry didn't exist. The actors' union began admitting content creators in 2021 and still has only a small number of them, but questions have quickly emerged around how the union's dispute with the major Hollywood studios will affect popular internet personalities.
The union's message that content creators will be blocked from membership if they provide work or services for struck companies has sent many scrambling. A number of creators have pledged support for writers and actors and circulated "scab" lists of influencers who promote new releases or appear at related events. Others have been frustrated or confused by instructions from a union that doesn't protect them, and that some had never heard of.
SAG-AFTRA, which represents some 160,000 movie and television actors, approved a strike on July 13. The division with the studios is driven largely by concerns about compensation in the streaming era and artificial intelligence. They joined screenwriters, who walked off the job in May, the first dual shutdown since 1960. During the strike, actors are not able to engage in publicity efforts for their projects or appear at film festivals or events like Comic-Con.
Influencers have become crucial to the entertainment industry in recent years, especially during the pandemic, building buzz and promoting products. They post videos to hype new TV shows and movies, appear on red carpets and at events like the MTV Video Music Awards, and unbox products tied to film and television characters. Typically, as in the case with Ms. Giulietti, outside agencies hire creators on behalf of the studios.
Now those activities, besides limiting their career ambitions, could lead to internet backlash, with one nonunion influencer already posting an apology video for appearing at a recent Disney movie premiere. Others have posted promotional videos anyway, without backtracking or pulling the content. At least one creator posting from a recent premiere opted to turn off their TikTok comments, possibly to avoid potential criticism.
On the flip side, videos from creators about jobs and events that they rejected in solidarity with actors have racked up praise and views on TikTok.
"We don't have power to make decisions for the talent, but we will in this moment recommend not engaging with struck work or struck companies on paid or organic projects," said Victoria Bachan, president of Whalar Talent, a unit of a creator commerce company that works with more than 200 content creators. She added that young creators were also more apt to be supportive of unions and organized labor.
Still, Whitney Singleton, a 27-year-old with 1.2 million TikTok followers, has been frustrated by what is being asked of her. She had never heard of SAG-AFTRA until the past couple of weeks. Ms. Singleton, using the moniker @KeepUpRadio, has attracted fans by singing and rapping about her favorite video games like Fortnite and streaming herself playing video games. It has been her full-time job for three years. She has collaborated with struck companies like Amazon in the past.
"I really do value creators, and I want them to get what they deserve," Ms. Singleton said. "But it's really hard for me to just be finding out about an organization and being expected to fall in line with their initiative when I feel like it's new to me and the influencer space."
She said some influencers were being asked to turn down five-figure deals, and that "the majority of creators I've talked to about it feel it's unfair that as nonunion members, they're being included in this conversation."
Ms. Singleton was invited to an early screening of the "Barbie" movie and said that while it wasn't a paid promotion, the union's guidelines for promoting the movie were "what I would deem murky." Ultimately, she decided to post about the event, for which she dyed her hair pink.
"I actually got no negative feedback, it was all positive," she said. "For a moment, I felt a bit scared and put in a corner with these requirements because I respect creators in all industries, but I wouldn't be being true to my heart if I had let those things stop me from living my life and sharing the content."
The union did not respond to questions about the criticism or about how many influencers are included in its membership. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates on behalf of the biggest studios, has said its offers to the writers and the actors were "historic" improvements on their previous contracts.
The reality for many creators is that they dream of someday achieving a level of fame beyond the smartphone screen, making the threat of blacklisting by Hollywood's most powerful union an ominous one.
Mario Mirante, a 28-year-old comedian on TikTok with 3.6 million followers, recently posted a popular video about turning down a deal to promote a show based on his support for actors and writers and his long-term ambitions. Mr. Mirante has hoped to work in Hollywood since childhood, and even has a tattoo of Jim Carrey as "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" on his arm.
"That's a lot of influencers' goal and aspiration and why they do it," said Mr. Mirante, who lives in Las Vegas. "We love to entertain and express ourselves, and that's the Super Bowl, that's the ultimate, being in a movie or a TV show."
Mr. Mirante has previously been paid to promote the movie "Champions" starring Woody Harrelson and a product tied to the "Guardians of the Galaxy" franchise.
"If I were to help the big studios amid this, I'm just hurting myself in the future, if that makes any sense," he said. "Of course I'm not a part of it right now, but they're fighting for basic rights, livable wages, not to have their A.I. likeness taken."
Krishna Subramanian, a founder of the influencer marketing firm Captiv8, said studios might need to pivot away from creators during the strike and get agencies to make more traditional display ads to place on Facebook and other sites.
Simone Umba is a TikTok creator with more than 300,000 followers who primarily posts about TV shows and movies but has paused making such videos. She said that many influencers felt that they were "stuck in the middle," but that most were opting to side with the union even as invitations and deals piled up.
"We knew we were going to get approached, and it's like we're in a really messy family feud," Ms. Umba, 26, said.
She added, "Regardless of if you want to join the union or not, you don't want to be one of those people that was willing to take a check instead of standing in support of people fighting for actual livable wages."
Ms. Umba said that it had been painful to miss out on posting about the star-studded "Barbie" movie after this summer's marketing bonanza and that she had declined to attend an early screening of the film in Atlanta. She and a friend were messaging recently after trailers for "The Marvels" dropped, agonizing over their inability to post.
"We were texting each other back and forth, like, this is so hard," she said. She said she was prepared to hold out for months but was already thinking of holiday releases. She crossed her fingers, held them up and said, "Please, please, don't let it get to Christmas."

Atlantic Nears 'Tipping Point,' Scientists Say: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The system of ocean currents that regulates the climate for a swath of the planet could collapse sooner than expected, a new analysis found.
The last time there was a major slowdown in the mighty network of ocean currents that shapes the climate around the North Atlantic, it seems to have plunged Europe into a deep cold for over a millennium.
That was roughly 12,800 years ago, when not many people were around to experience it. But in recent decades, human-driven warming could be causing the currents to slow once more, and scientists have been working to determine whether and when they might undergo another great weakening, which would have ripple effects for weather patterns across a swath of the globe.
A pair of researchers in Denmark this week put forth a bold answer: A sharp weakening of the currents, or even a shutdown, could be upon us by century's end.
It was a surprise even to the researchers that their analysis showed a potential collapse coming so soon, one of them, Susanne Ditlevsen, a professor of statistics at the University of Copenhagen, said in an interview. Climate scientists generally agree that the Atlantic circulation will decline this century, but there's no consensus on whether it will stall out before 2100.
Which is why it was also a surprise, Dr. Ditlevsen said, that she and her co-author were able to pin down the timing of a collapse at all. Scientists are bound to continue studying and debating the issue, but Dr. Ditlevsen said the new findings were reason enough not to regard a shutdown as an abstract, far-off concern. "It's now," she said.
The new research, published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, adds to a growing body of scientific work that describes how humankind's continued emissions of heat-trapping gases could set off climate "tipping points," or rapid and hard-to-reverse changes in the environment.
Abrupt thawing of the Arctic permafrost. Loss of the Amazon rain forest. Collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. Once the world warms past a certain point, these and other events could be set into swift motion, scientists warn, though the exact thresholds at which this would occur are still highly uncertain.
In the Atlantic, researchers have been searching for harbingers of tipping-point-like change in a tangle of ocean currents that goes by an unlovely name: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC (pronounced "AY-mock").
These currents carry warm waters from the tropics through the Gulf Stream, past the southeastern United States, before bending toward northern Europe. When this water releases its heat into the air farther north, it becomes colder and denser, causing it to sink to the deep ocean and move back toward the Equator. This sinking effect, or "overturning," allows the currents to transfer enormous amounts of heat around the planet, making them hugely influential for the climate around the Atlantic and beyond.
As humans warm the atmosphere, however, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is adding large amounts of fresh water to the North Atlantic, which could be disrupting the balance of heat and salinity that keeps the overturning moving. A patch of the Atlantic south of Greenland has cooled conspicuously in recent years, creating a "cold blob" that some scientists see as a sign that the system is slowing.
Were the circulation to tip into a much weaker state, the effects on the climate would be far-reaching, though scientists are still examining their potential magnitude. Much of the Northern Hemisphere could cool. The coastlines of North America and Europe could see faster sea-level rise. Northern Europe could experience stormier winters, while the Sahel in Africa and the monsoon regions of Asia would most likely get less rain.
Evidence from ice and sediment cores indicates that the Atlantic circulation underwent abrupt stops and starts in the deep past. But scientists' most advanced computer models of the global climate have produced a wide range of predictions for how the currents might behave in the coming decades, in part because the mix of factors that shape them is so complex.
Dr. Ditlevsen's new analysis focused on a simple metric, based on sea-surface temperatures, that is similar to ones other scientists have used as proxies for the strength of the Atlantic circulation. She conducted the analysis with Peter Ditlevsen, her brother, who is a climate scientist at the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute. They used data on their proxy measure from 1870 to 2020 to calculate statistical indicators that presage changes in the overturning.
"Not only do we see an increase in these indicators," Peter Ditlevsen said, "but we see an increase which is consistent with this approaching a tipping point."
They then used the mathematical properties of a tipping-point-like system to extrapolate from these trends. That led them to predict that the Atlantic circulation could collapse around midcentury, though it could potentially occur as soon as 2025 and as late as 2095.
Their analysis included no specific assumptions about how much greenhouse-gas emissions will rise in this century. It assumed only that the forces bringing about an AMOC collapse would continue at an unchanging pace -- essentially, that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would keep rising as they have since the Industrial Revolution.
In interviews, several researchers who study the overturning applauded the new analysis for using a novel approach to predict when we might cross a tipping point, particularly given how hard it has been to do so using computer models of the global climate. But they voiced reservations about some of its methods, and said more work was still needed to nail down the timing with greater certainty.
Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer at Georgia Tech, said sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic near Greenland weren't necessarily influenced by changes in the overturning alone, making them a questionable proxy for inferring those changes. She pointed to a study published last year showing that much of the cold blob's development could be explained by shifts in wind and atmospheric patterns.
Scientists are now using sensors slung across the Atlantic to directly measure the overturning. Dr. Lozier is involved in one of these measurement efforts. The aim is to better understand what's driving the changes beneath the waves, and to improve projections of future changes.
But the projects began collecting data in 2004 at the earliest, which isn't enough time to draw firm long-term conclusions. "It is extremely difficult to look at a short record for the ocean overturning and say what it is going to do over 30, 40 or 50 years," Dr. Lozier said.
Levke Caesar, a postdoctoral researcher studying the overturning at the University of Bremen in Germany, expressed concerns about the older temperature records that Dr. Ditlevsen and Dr. Ditlevsen used to compute their proxy. These records, from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, might not be reliable enough to be used for fine-toothed statistical analysis without careful adjustments, she said.
Still, the new study sent an urgent message about the need to keep collecting data on the changing ocean currents, Dr. Caesar said. "There is something happening, and it's likely out of the ordinary," she said. "Something that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for us humans."
Scientists' uncertainty about the timing of an AMOC collapse shouldn't be taken as an excuse for not reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to try to avoid it, said Hali Kilbourne, an associate research professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.
"It is very plausible that we've fallen off a cliff already and don't know it," Dr. Kilbourne said. "I fear, honestly, that by the time any of this is settled science, it's way too late to act."

Deanna Giulietti is not in the actors’ union, but she turned down $28,000 last week because of its strike.
Giulietti, a 29-year-old content creator with 1.8 million TikTok followers, had received an offer to promote the new season of Hulu’s hit show “Only Murders in the Building.”
But SAG-AFTRA, as the union is known, recently issued rules stating that any influencer who engages in promotion for one of the Hollywood studios the actors are striking against will be ineligible for membership. (The Walt Disney Co. is the majority owner of Hulu.) That gave Giulietti, who also acts and aspires to one day join the union, reason enough to decline the offer from Influential, a marketing agency working with Hulu.
The union’s rule is part of a variety of aggressive tactics that hit at a pivotal moment for Hollywood labor and shows its desire to assert itself in a new era and with a different, mostly younger wave of creative talent.
“I want to be in these Netflix shows, I want to be in the Hulu shows, but we’re standing by the writers, we’re standing by SAG,” Giulietti said. “People write me off whenever I say I’m an influencer, and I’m like, ‘No, I really feel I could be making the difference here.’ ”
That difference comes at a cost. In addition to the Hulu deal, Giulietti recently declined a $5,000 offer from the app TodayTix to promote the Searchlight Pictures movie “Theater Camp.” (Disney also owns Searchlight.) She said she was living at home with her parents in Cheshire, Connecticut, and putting off renting an apartment in New York City while she saw how the strike — which, along with a writers’ strike, could go on for months — would affect her income.
Representatives for Searchlight and TodayTix did not respond to requests for comment. Hulu and Influential declined to comment.

This sinking effect, or “overturning,” allows the currents to transfer enormous amounts of heat around the planet, making them hugely influential for the climate around the Atlantic and beyond.
As humans warm the atmosphere, however, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is adding large amounts of freshwater to the North Atlantic, which could be disrupting the balance of heat and salinity that keeps the overturning moving. A patch of the Atlantic south of Greenland has cooled conspicuously in recent years, creating a “cold blob” that some scientists see as a sign that the system is slowing.
Were the circulation to tip into a much weaker state, the effects on the climate would be far-reaching, although scientists are still examining their potential magnitude. Much of the Northern Hemisphere could cool. The coastlines of North America and Europe could see faster sea-level rise. Northern Europe could experience stormier winters, while the Sahel in Africa and the monsoon regions of Asia would most likely get less rain.
Evidence from ice and sediment cores indicates that the Atlantic circulation underwent abrupt stops and starts in the deep past. But scientists’ most advanced computer models of the global climate have produced a wide range of predictions for how the currents might behave in the coming decades, in part because the mix of factors that shape them is so complex.
Ditlevsen’s new analysis focused on a simple metric, based on sea-surface temperatures, that is similar to ones other scientists have used as proxies for the strength of the Atlantic circulation. She conducted the analysis with Peter Ditlevsen, her brother, who is a climate scientist at the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute. They used data on their proxy measure from 1870 to 2020 to calculate statistical indicators that presage changes in the overturning.
“Not only do we see an increase in these indicators,” Peter Ditlevsen said, “but we see an increase which is consistent with this approaching a tipping point.”
They then used the mathematical properties of a tipping point-like system to extrapolate from these trends. That led them to predict that the Atlantic circulation could collapse around midcentury, though it could potentially occur as soon as 2025 and as late as 2095.
Their analysis included no specific assumptions about how much greenhouse gas emissions will rise in this century. It assumed only that the forces bringing about an AMOC collapse would continue at an unchanging pace — essentially, that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would keep rising as they have since the Industrial Revolution.
In interviews, several researchers who study the overturning applauded the new analysis for using a novel approach to predict when we might cross a tipping point, particularly given how hard it has been to do so using computer models of the global climate. But they voiced reservations about some of its methods and said more work was still needed to nail down the timing with greater certainty.
Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer at Georgia Tech, said sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic near Greenland weren’t necessarily influenced by changes in the overturning alone, making them a questionable proxy for inferring those changes. She pointed to a study published last year showing that much of the cold blob’s development could be explained by shifts in wind and atmospheric patterns.
Scientists are now using sensors slung across the Atlantic to directly measure the overturning. Lozier is involved in one of these measurement efforts. The aim is to better understand what’s driving the changes beneath the waves and to improve projections of future changes.
But the projects began collecting data in 2004 at the earliest, which isn’t enough time to draw firm long-term conclusions. “It is extremely difficult to look at a short record for the ocean overturning and say what it is going to do over 30, 40 or 50 years,” Lozier said.
Levke Caesar, a postdoctoral researcher studying the overturning at the University of Bremen in Germany, expressed concerns about the older temperature records that the Ditlevsen siblings used to compute their proxy. These records, from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, might not be reliable enough to be used for fine-toothed statistical analysis without careful adjustments, she said.
Still, the new study sent an urgent message about the need to keep collecting data on the changing ocean currents, Caesar said. “There is something happening, and it’s likely out of the ordinary,” she said. “Something that wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for us humans.”
Scientists’ uncertainty about the timing of an AMOC collapse shouldn’t be taken as an excuse for not reducing greenhouse gas emissions to try to avoid it, said Hali Kilbourne, an associate research professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.
“It is very plausible that we’ve fallen off a cliff already and don’t know it,” Kilbourne said. “I fear, honestly, that by the time any of this is settled science, it’s way too late to act.”

Full text: Seven leading A.I. companies made eight promises about what they'll do with their technology. Our columnist sizes up their potential impact.
This week, the White House announced that it had secured "voluntary commitments" from seven leading A.I. companies to manage the risks posed by artificial intelligence.
Getting the companies -- Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI -- to agree to anything is a step forward. They include bitter rivals with subtle but important differences in the ways they're approaching A.I. research and development.
Meta, for example, is so eager to get its A.I. models into developers' hands that it has open-sourced many of them, putting their code out into the open for anyone to use. Other labs, such as Anthropic, have taken a more cautious approach, releasing their technology in more limited ways.
But what do these commitments actually mean? And are they likely to change much about how A.I. companies operate, given that they aren't backed by the force of law?
Given the potential stakes of A.I. regulation, the details matter. So let's take a closer look at what's being agreed to here and size up the potential impact.
Commitment 1: The companies commit to internal and external security testing of their A.I. systems before their release.
Each of these A.I. companies already does security testing -- what is often called "red-teaming" -- of its models before they're released. On one level, this isn't really a new commitment. And it's a vague promise. It doesn't come with many details about what kind of testing is required, or who will do the testing.
In a statement accompanying the commitments, the White House said only that testing of A.I. models "will be carried out in part by independent experts" and focus on A.I. risks "such as biosecurity and cybersecurity, as well as its broader societal effects."
It's a good idea to get A.I. companies to publicly commit to continue doing this kind of testing, and to encourage more transparency in the testing process. And there are some types of A.I. risk -- such as the danger that A.I. models could be used to develop bioweapons -- that government and military officials are probably better suited than companies to evaluate.
I'd love to see the A.I. industry agree on a standard battery of safety tests, such as the "autonomous replication" tests that the Alignment Research Center conducts on prereleased models by OpenAI and Anthropic. I'd also like to see the federal government fund these kinds of tests, which can be expensive and require engineers with significant technical expertise. Right now, many safety tests are funded and overseen by the companies, which raises obvious conflict-of-interest questions.
Commitment 2: The companies commit to sharing information across the industry and with governments, civil society and academia on managing A.I. risks.
This commitment is also a bit vague. Several of these companies already publish information about their A.I. models -- typically in academic papers or corporate blog posts. A few of them, including OpenAI and Anthropic, also publish documents called "system cards," which outline the steps they've taken to make those models safer.
But they have also held back information on occasion, citing safety concerns. When OpenAI released its latest A.I. model, GPT-4, this year, it broke with industry customs and chose not to disclose how much data it was trained on, or how big the model was (a metric known as "parameters"). It said it declined to release this information because of concerns about competition and safety. It also happens to be the kind of data that tech companies like to keep away from competitors.
Under these new commitments, will A.I. companies be compelled to make that kind of information public? What if doing so risks accelerating the A.I. arms race?
I suspect that the White House's goal is less about forcing companies to disclose their parameter counts and more about encouraging them to trade information with one another about the risks that their models do (or don't) pose.
But even that kind of information-sharing can be risky. If Google's A.I. team prevented a new model from being used to engineer a deadly bioweapon during prerelease testing, should it share that information outside Google? Would that risk giving bad actors ideas about how they might get a less guarded model to perform the same task?
Commitment 3: The companies commit to investing in cybersecurity and insider-threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights.
This one is pretty straightforward, and uncontroversial among the A.I. insiders I've talked to. "Model weights" is a technical term for the mathematical instructions that give A.I. models the ability to function. Weights are what you'd want to steal if you were an agent of a foreign government (or a rival corporation) who wanted to build your own version of ChatGPT or another A.I. product. And it's something A.I. companies have a vested interest in keeping tightly controlled.
There have already been well-publicized issues with model weights leaking. The weights for Meta's original LLaMA language model, for example, were leaked on 4chan and other websites just days after the model was publicly released. Given the risks of more leaks -- and the interest that other nations may have in stealing this technology from U.S. companies -- asking A.I. companies to invest more in their own security feels like a no-brainer.
Commitment 4: The companies commit to facilitating third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities in their A.I. systems.
I'm not really sure what this means. Every A.I. company has discovered vulnerabilities in its models after releasing them, usually because users try to do bad things with the models or circumvent their guardrails (a practice known as "jailbreaking") in ways the companies hadn't foreseen.
The White House's commitment calls for companies to establish a "robust reporting mechanism" for these vulnerabilities, but it's not clear what that might mean. An in-app feedback button, similar to the ones that allow Facebook and Twitter users to report rule-violating posts? A bug bounty program, like the one OpenAI started this year to reward users who find flaws in its systems? Something else? We'll have to wait for more details.
Commitment 5: The companies commit to developing robust technical mechanisms to ensure that users know when content is A.I. generated, such as a watermarking system.
This is an interesting idea but leaves a lot of room for interpretation. So far, A.I. companies have struggled to devise tools that allow people to tell whether or not they're looking at A.I. generated content. There are good technical reasons for this, but it's a real problem when people can pass off A.I.-generated work as their own. (Ask any high school teacher.) And many of the tools currently promoted as being able to detect A.I. outputs really can't do so with any degree of accuracy.
I'm not optimistic that this problem is fully fixable. But I'm glad that companies are pledging to work on it.
Commitment 6: The companies commit to publicly reporting their A.I. systems' capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and inappropriate use.
Another sensible-sounding pledge with lots of wiggle room. How often will companies be required to report on their systems' capabilities and limitations? How detailed will that information have to be? And given that many of the companies building A.I. systems have been surprised by their own systems' capabilities after the fact, how well can they really be expected to describe them in advance?
Commitment 7: The companies commit to prioritizing research on the societal risks that A.I. systems can pose, including on avoiding harmful bias and discrimination and protecting privacy.
Committing to "prioritizing research" is about as fuzzy as a commitment gets. Still, I'm sure this commitment will be received well by many in the A.I. ethics crowd, who want A.I. companies to make preventing near-term harms like bias and discrimination a priority over worrying about doomsday scenarios, as the A.I. safety folks do.
If you're confused by the difference between "A.I. ethics" and "A.I. safety," just know that there are two warring factions within the A.I. research community, each of which thinks the other is focused on preventing the wrong kinds of harms.
Commitment 8: The companies commit to develop and deploy advanced A.I. systems to help address society's greatest challenges.
I don't think many people would argue that advanced A.I. should not be used to help address society's greatest challenges. The White House lists "cancer prevention" and "mitigating climate change" as two of the areas where it would like A.I. companies to focus their efforts, and it will get no disagreement from me there.
What makes this goal somewhat complicated, though, is that in A.I. research, what starts off looking frivolous often turns out to have more serious implications. Some of the technology that went into DeepMind's AlphaGo -- an A.I. system that was trained to play the board game Go -- turned out to be useful in predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins, a major discovery that boosted basic scientific research.
Overall, the White House's deal with A.I. companies seems more symbolic than substantive. There is no enforcement mechanism to make sure companies follow these commitments, and many of them reflect precautions that A.I. companies are already taking.
Still, it's a reasonable first step. And agreeing to follow these rules shows that the A.I. companies have learned from the failures of earlier tech companies, which waited to engage with the government until they got into trouble. In Washington, at least where tech regulation is concerned, it pays to show up early.

This Is How The Bosses Win: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: NOTTINGHAM, Md. -- Agnes Torregoza came to this country when she was a toddler, brought from the Philippines by her parents. Her mother found a teaching job in the Baltimore County Public School District, and the family set about cobbling together a new life.
Both parents eventually got union jobs in the public schools and moved with their children into a prefabricated home in the unincorporated reaches of the Baltimore suburbs. Her parents, Ms. Torregoza explained, had very definite ideas about the aesthetics of the American dream -- everything should be fresh.
"My parents are really into, 'Oh, we're in America,"' Ms. Torregoza, 20, said. "'I want to have a brand-new house. I want to have a new car."'
When it came time to forge her own path, Ms. Torregoza, a slight woman with a black fringe of bangs and exactingly applied makeup, puzzled over her options. She'd graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, a competitive magnet high school, and took some community college classes. She dreamed of attending a liberal arts college, but found the cost of tuition both unattainable and philosophically repellent.
"All these people who talked about race and class had spent so much money to go to school," she said. "How can you talk about making things more equitable, but you're spending $ 30,000 a year on tuition?"
So Ms. Torregoza applied for a Starbucks barista job in a strip mall near home. She'd heard about the coffee conglomerate's generous benefits -- tuition money, company stock, health insurance for part-time workers. But once she got to work, disillusionment set in.
The first thing she noticed: There never seemed to be enough people on the clock. Everybody rushed around while automated systems logged the speed of drive-through transactions -- ideally, 30 to 40 seconds -- and whether surveyed customers rated the baristas likable. Not that she had time to ruminate on her scores -- Ms. Torregoza says she and her colleagues could hardly attend to basic hygiene. They often found themselves too frenzied to wipe down tables, clean the bathrooms or follow orders to wash their hands every half-hour, she said.
Oddly, despite this state of affairs, Ms. Torregoza couldn't get enough shifts. She dreamed of saving money, moving out on her own, maybe transferring to a Starbucks downtown -- but for that, she'd need to work. She got, at most, 25 or 27 hours a week, which was considered generous for Starbucks, where baristas say they rarely get full-time hours and even struggle for the 20 they need to qualify for benefits.
Ms. Torregoza's discontent was growing, and she wasn't alone. She'd donned her green Starbucks apron just as a labor insurrection was exploding across the company. The hectic, high-risk pandemic shifts had racked up record profits for Starbucks, but left many of the baristas exhausted and embittered. Workers at one cafe after the next were voting to unionize -- more than 330 of its thousands of locations so far. Their demands include better pay ( $ 20 an hour minimum for baristas, with annual raises), fair and consistent scheduling and easier access to the benefits that Starbucks executives were always touting.
The Nottingham Starbucks voted to join Starbucks Workers United in June 2022 -- and Ms. Torregoza and her colleagues stepped into a world of trouble.
The corporate dirty war that ensued -- in Nottingham and at newly unionized Starbucks cafes across the country -- draws a sobering picture of employee rights casually crushed and labor laws too weak to help. Starbucks continues to fight and appeal the many labor complaints pending against it and maintains that the company has done nothing wrong.
But these professions of innocence are countered by piles of testimony from workers and National Labor Relations Board findings suggesting that Starbucks has indeed illegally repressed employees' rights. The company has so far racked up a staggering number of complaints from the agency. In 100 cases, many of which consolidate a number of incidents, regional N.L.R.B. offices have decided there is sufficient evidence to pursue litigation against Starbucks. That includes a nationwide complaint, consolidating 32 charges across 28 states, alleging that Starbucks failed or refused to bargain with union representatives from 163 cafes.
Starbucks lacks the glamour of Hollywood and the indispensability of UPS, but as strikes and union drives erupt across the economy, the coffee workers' struggle illuminates the stark and sometimes insurmountable challenges confronted by ordinary American workers who try to exercise their right to organize.
That Starbucks is carrying on this campaign in plain sight may be the most damning aspect: Union busting is illegal, but consequences are inconsequential. The Starbucks case demonstrates that a large corporation can effectively bust a union with time, by dithering over details and exhausting legal appeals. According to national labor laws, an employer "must bargain in good faith." But that is a squishy and essentially unenforceable rule. Starbucks may yet succeed in smothering one of the most energized labor movements of our time.
It's important to understand what Starbucks has done -- and what it hasn't done. The company has been accused of deploying familiar anti-labor tactics, such as the shuttering of some union stronghold cafes. (Starbucks denies closing stores in response to union drives and blames other factors, such as crime.) Union activists reported being spied upon, harassed or fired on flimsy pretexts, complaints that Starbucks disputes.
But Starbucks has also done a lot of nothing -- time-buying, morale-eroding, innocent-seeming nothing. The company dedicated to caffeinating the world turns out to be very good at moving slowly, and the inaction is devastating for the workers, many of whom are economically vulnerable. Starbucks, on the other hand, faces little risk. Even if the company eventually ends up losing cases on the final appeal -- a stage that could take years -- the N.L.R.B. is barred from imposing monetary penalties. The board can only order employers to "make whole" anyone who lost money and warn them to do better.
"We'd email them, and they weren't responding," said Marina Multhaup, a Seattle-based lawyer who represents all the Starbucks unions in the Pacific Northwest. "So we'd file a charge, which is really all we can do."
"Months and months later," Ms. Multhaup said, the National Labor Relations Board "agreed that Starbucks was not bargaining. And we go to a whole hearing about it. But meanwhile, it's been months and months."
Across the country, the coffee company has drastically slowed negotiations by insisting (illegally, according to the N.L.R.B.'s general counsel) on in-person bargaining. The demand for face-to-face negotiations has severely hindered coffee shop workers who unionized in part because their schedules were erratic. When union representatives join by Zoom, Starbucks representatives abruptly stand and walk out.
"It really puts on display the whole power differential," Ms. Multhaup said.
Meanwhile, not a single Starbucks union member has gotten a contract, and the union says the company hasn't suggested any counterproposals in response to union demands.
These passive tactics of delay and avoidance are quiet and undramatic -- especially compared with the bloody strikes and picket brawls of America's past -- but remarkably effective at crushing nascent unions, labor experts warn. We hear a lot about hard-fought unionization votes at Amazon and Trader Joe's and REI, but once the election excitement fades, half the certified unions never secure a contract, said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
"The main line of defense is, 'We're just not going to sign a contract,' and that's just as effective," Mr. Lichtenstein said. "And if you don't have it within a year, well, the turnover is so great, and some of the people are no longer there."
"The labor law has become broken," he said.
As for the N.L.R.B., the agency has made no secret that it's struggling to keep pace. Despite surging interest in unions -- including a 53 percent jump in union petitions from 2021 to 2022 -- the agency operates on a tight budget and a skeleton crew. The number of field staff workers available to carry out labor investigations today is half of what it was 20 years ago.
In the realm of unionized Starbucks cafes, some of which have clashed spectacularly with management, Nottingham isn't known as a battleground. But Ms. Torregoza and her colleagues have nevertheless endured waves of fallout this past year.
Ms. Torregoza's weekly hours gradually dwindled to 10 after the election, she said, forcing her to ration gas and delay veterinary visits for her cat, Charlie. Starbucks managers across the country are accused of slashing unionized workers' hours to starvation levels. When Ms. Torregoza tried to supplement her income by picking up shifts in nearby Starbucks locations, as she had often done before, she found herself stonewalled. One manager, she said, finally remarked that Ms. Torregoza's union work made her an unwelcome presence. (Ms. Torregoza has filed unfair labor practice complaints over this alleged discrimination.)
"They're trying to get us to a point where we all just quit," said Thanya Cruz Borrazas, who worked with Ms. Torregoza in the Nottingham cafe and in the union.
Meanwhile, the cafes that didn't unionize were reaping fiercely desired improvements -- the dress code was finally loosened and tipping by credit card, rather than just cash, was enabled.
Howard Schultz, a steely eyed, self-made former Starbucks chief executive, has told his story all over the country: the impoverished childhood in shoddy housing; the disabled and mistreated father; final vindication through the achievement of the American dream, a phrase he likes to use.
It's a good story, and we bought it -- we bought his coffee at a premium price, and we bought him, too. Hillary Clinton, by many accounts, planned to nominate Mr. Schultz for labor secretary if she'd won the presidential election in 2016. Mr. Schultz himself has toyed with the idea of running for president.
Mr. Schultz frequently lectures people about having built a "different kind of company" that respects the rights of employees, whom he calls partners. An empty chair gapes at every board meeting in a symbolic nod to the partners, who may or may not feel gratified at being represented by a piece of furniture.
When the recent wave of labor organizing first started to foment among Starbucks workers in Buffalo, Mr. Schultz was one of the corporate luminaries who jetted into town to discourage the union. It didn't work, though -- in 2021, a Buffalo Starbucks became the first company-owned cafe to unionize, and other stores quickly followed. Mr. Schultz greeted the union with an indignation that has yet to fade. He has flouted an N.L.R.B. order to apologize to his workers and to film and distribute a video explaining his employees' rights.
"Starbucks Coffee Company did not break the law," Mr. Schultz replied flatly in March when lawmakers in Congress questioned him about the video.
The baristas from Nottingham were there that day. The union had paid for their train tickets to Washington so that they could watch Mr. Schultz testify at the Capitol. He hadn't wanted to face lawmakers' questions; he'd agreed to come only after he was threatened with a subpoena. But the baristas were ebullient. It was, in a sense, a business trip -- a first for Ms. Torregoza, who wore her union T-shirt and took careful notes.
"It was very surreal," she said. "My mom texted me, like, 'Oh, I heard on NPR that Schultz is going to testify today,' and I was like, 'Yeah, I'll be there."'
The storied entrepreneur came across as icy and defensive, insisting Starbucks had done nothing wrong and that his anti-union stance was simply a "preference" that he had every right to express.
"Yes, I have billions of dollars," he snapped when lawmakers referred to him as a billionaire. "I earned it. No one gave it to me. Anyone who keeps labeling this billionaire thing," he added, "it's your moniker constantly and it's unfair."
This intransigence seemed improbable from a public figure whose own life story begins with his father, a truck driver, suffering a severe leg injury on the job, which threw his family into desperate straits. Mr. Schultz, a child at the time, has called this a "defining moment" in his life.
Upbraiding him for "squeezing the people who made you rich," Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, invoked Mr. Schultz's father.
"Your father had no rights and your family paid the price. That is how your workers now feel," Mr. Markey thundered. "That is something I think, Mr. Schultz, that you just fundamentally don't understand. These workers are just like your father, and they have no rights."
Mr. Schultz appeared offended at hearing the young baristas compared with his father.
"You bring up my father," he sputtered. "You don't understand, sir, my father was a World War II veteran. He fought for this country in the South Pacific. You don't understand."
By the time labor experts and unionized workers testified to Starbucks' abuses, Mr. Schultz and his team -- a small army of nattily dressed advisers and lawyers -- had left the building.
The baristas from Nottingham recalled watching him go, wondering if he'd look their way.
He didn't.
A billionaire who doesn't want to be called a billionaire, who blusters when his company's service workers get likened to the blue-collar worker who raised him -- this is the chasm between our putative national values and our daily reality. We want to believe in a middle-class America where hard work weaves its own safety net. But millions of workers don't earn enough money to cover basic expenses.
Unions helped create the American middle class and delivered livable pay, a two-day weekend, sick leave and overtime. But their power has largely faded. While some industries like Hollywood remain heavily unionized and a few private companies like UPS are still union strongholds, organizers have struggled to penetrate the service sector, which contains a majority of American jobs. Unions now enjoy the highest U.S. approval rating in decades, thanks partly to the deeply demoralizing experience many service workers endured during the pandemic and partly, no doubt, to the growing realization that neither corporate benevolence nor legislative nobility can be expected to save us.
The federal minimum wage, which has not increased since 2009, now sits at a plainly unlivable $ 7.25 an hour.
Ms. Torregoza was still in elementary school in 2012, when fast food workers began the "Fight for $ 15" to lobby for a minimum wage hike. That struggle has dragged on so long that the original (and still unmet) demand is outdated and insufficient. Most Americans, no matter their political beliefs, now believe that people should earn at least $ 20 an hour, according to recent polling.
In his testimony, Mr. Schultz repeatedly reminded lawmakers that the average Starbucks worker earns $ 17.50 -- more than the minimum wage in all 50 states.
Then Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, told Mr. Schultz bluntly that the salary he was touting wasn't enough to survive.
"Even $ 17, that's not a living wage in this day and age," Mr. Braun said. "Any large corporation shouldn't necessarily be bragging about $ 15- or $ 20-an-hour wages."
Ms. Cruz Borrazas worked in Nottingham through the pandemic. This, she recalls, required stifling her fear of getting sick while scrambling to make ever more drinks, ever more quickly, with fewer clocked-in colleagues to help. At one point, a burst pipe in the cafe forced her to slog through a few inches of water, trying not to think about the electrical wires or her sodden feet. In the middle of all that, she'd sometimes glance at the run report tallying the sales.
"I'm over here, like, having palpitations because I don't have time to get a sip of water," she said. "And it'll be like, they just made $ 700."
Managers at the Nottingham cafe did not respond to phone messages; a former Nottingham manager who has since left Starbucks also declined an interview.
It was during the pandemic that Starbucks workers began to unionize in earnest -- when the job started to feel physically dangerous, when the shifts got more hectic and baristas had to tangle with mask-refusing customers in between filling takeout and delivery orders.
"We felt very disposable," said Alexis Rizzo, a Buffalo shift supervisor who became a key union organizer, only to be fired, she says, for being a few minutes late. (Starbucks has said her absences were more egregious.) "People were angry."
Mr. Schultz speaks of Italian espresso bars and cushy benefits, but workers describe a reality that is harsher.
"You're constantly seeing the company boast about how they have the best benefits in the industry, and then I see my co-workers on Medicaid because they don't have enough hours or it's too expensive," Ms. Rizzo said. "It's just a lot of the company pretending to be something they're not."
The baristas from Nottingham asked to meet me in downtown Baltimore, at a nonunion Starbucks in a bustling neighborhood near the Johns Hopkins University campus. Unlike their cafe, which is set among flat, broad roads between Lowe's Home Improvement and Taco Bell, this Starbucks was urban and airy, with no drive-through in sight. I wasn't sure why we were there.
At 22, Ms. Cruz Borrazas has a quiet, somewhat dreamy bearing, long curls tumbling over her shoulders. Born in Uruguay, she too was brought as a toddler to the United States, where her parents work blue-collar jobs in cleaning, construction and demolition. Ms. Cruz Borrazas has a green card but is not a citizen, and she never had health insurance until she managed to buy it through her job at Starbucks. After the union vote, she said, her hours were eventually cut so badly she risked dropping below the threshold to keep the benefits. She'd recently been cashing out her sick time to supplement her paychecks.
"Yes, there's a light at the end of the tunnel," she told me that day. "But it's a long tunnel, and there are monsters."
In her four years at Starbucks, she says, she never saw a barista get full-time hours. None of her colleagues, she told me, can afford to live alone.
But then she, too, mentions the American dream.
"I feel like the union is my only way out," she said. "It's the ticket to the middle class."
I was starting to understand why we'd met in the city, the walkable streets, the cafe full of students and downtown workers, the suggestion of self-sufficiency.
When Ms. Torregoza talked about the union, she kept veering into discussion of her life in the far suburbs, which she considered sterile and unsustainable. There aren't enough sidewalks, she said, and developments keep going up, like the Crumbl Cookies that had recently materialized a few doors down from Starbucks in the strip mall.
"It's a little unreal," she said. "It stresses me out, honestly."
This was the malaise of a youth spent in the shadows of enormous companies hungry for low-wage workers to staff identical counters. Imagine being brought thousands of miles in pursuit of a dream and then, as you come of age, squinting into this landscape where there is nothing but selling and shopping, and trying to understand what it was supposed to look like.
Life was moving faster for Ms. Cruz Borrazas through the spring. She was taking on more union responsibility, using unscheduled hours to advise Starbucks workers who were organizing in other places. Invited by the Workers' Rights Institute at Georgetown Law School, she spoke on a panel with Senator Sherrod Brown and Jennifer Abruzzo, the N.L.R.B.'s general counsel. But she had to send a few emails before getting the badly needed fee she said she'd been promised, leaving her feeling humiliated.
By the time spring gave way to summer, her hours had gotten cut so badly that she was officially broke -- her bank balance dropped into negative territory. At that point, Ms. Cruz Borrazas' health broke down. Malnourished and exhausted, she drove to the library one day but felt unable to get out of the car. So she drove to a hospital, where she was admitted for several days.
I heard first from Ms. Torregoza and later from Ms. Cruz Borrazas herself that upon getting out of the hospital, she'd quit her job at Starbucks and withdrawn from the union.
Starbucks can't be blamed for Ms. Cruz Borrazas' health crisis. Plenty of Starbucks workers are organizing under tremendous pressure without winding up in the hospital.
But listening on the phone as she described her breakdown, I noticed that material want and bodily fatigue were tangled into her thoughts. She'd been forcing things, she told me, trying to stand up to corporations, and that had been a mistake. To work and hustle as hard as she and her parents had always done, she told me, was "literally killing us ... it's killing our brains." She'd been in service her whole life, she said, and she felt unable to continue.
"All I ever wanted was to go back to my own country, see my family, not have to work so much, not have to see my parents struggling so much," she said. She told me that God had finally stepped in and told her that she could "just chill."
I remembered her describing how as a child, she feared illness not because it hurt, but because the cost of seeing a doctor could cripple her family. I thought about how badly she wanted to make herself safe and make her family stable by securing a spot in the elusive middle class. She'd glimpsed a way forward with the union. And then she'd lost it.
The Nottingham union is "cold" now, Ms. Torregoza recently told me. It's not one of the Starbucks sites where employees have voted to decertify the union. But turnover in Nottingham has been heavy, she said -- about half the staff has left and been replaced over the past year or so -- and, as the labor experts warned, union enthusiasm has withered.
The Nottingham workers never got a chance to bargain (Starbucks claims this is the union's fault for insisting on Zoom meetings). As the union fervor dies down, Ms. Torregoza says her hours are starting to inch back up again. I suggested that the old status quo might be asserting itself.
"That's not going to happen as long as I'm around," Ms. Torregoza said.
But I think it's possible. Maybe this quiet fading, engineered by a company with time and money to burn, is how the union dies.

They Checked Out Books to 'Hide the Pride.' It Did the Opposite.: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two San Diego residents cleared out the Pride month display at their library and said such materials shouldn't be available to children, one of several recent clashes over L.G.B.T.Q. issues in California.
Adrianne Peterson, the manager of the Rancho Peñasquitos branch of the San Diego Public Library, was actually a little embarrassed by the modest size of her Pride Month display in June. Between staff vacations and organizing workshops for graduating high school students, it had fallen through the cracks and fell short of what she had hoped to offer.
Yet the kiosk across from the checkout counter, marked by a Progress Pride rainbow flag, was enough to thrust the suburban library onto the front lines of the nation's culture wars.
Ms. Peterson, who has run the library branch since 2012 and highlighted books for Pride Month for the better part of a decade, was taken aback when she read an email last month from two neighborhood residents. They informed her that they had gotten nearly all of the books in the Pride display checked out and would not return them unless the library permanently removed what they considered "inappropriate content."
"It was just kind of like, 'Whoa, curveball,"' Ms. Peterson said. "I began to wonder, 'Oh, have I been misunderstanding our community?"'
Soon, she would get her answer: Stacks of Amazon boxes containing new copies of the books the protesters checked out started to arrive at the library after The San Diego Union-Tribune reported on the protest. Roughly 180 people, mostly San Diegans, gave more than $ 15,000 to the library system, which after a city match will provide over $ 30,000 toward more L.G.B.T.Q.-themed materials and programming, including an expansion of the system's already popular drag queen story hours.
In an ever divided nation, Americans are waging battles in big ways and small, right down to turning their library cards into protest weapons.
Right-wing activists have challenged the recognition of June as Pride Month and have sought to remove textbooks from schools and L.G.B.T.Q.-affirming picture books from libraries. In Republican-led states, those in office have used their power to change policy and ban materials contested by conservatives.
But even in California and other states led by Democrats, demonstrations against Pride events and L.G.B.T.Q.-themed books have broken out in recent weeks.
In North Hollywood, a neighborhood within the liberal stronghold of Los Angeles, a Pride flag was burned at an elementary school and dueling protests days later over a Pride assembly devolved into scuffles outside the campus. In Temecula, not far from San Diego, the conservative majority of the school board twice rejected elementary school materials that discuss Harvey Milk, the slain gay rights leader, and L.G.B.T.Q. history before agreeing to acquire them after Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to fine the school district $ 1.5 million for not complying with state standards.
And in Chino, the state's superintendent of public instruction, Tony Thurmond, was kicked out of a school board meeting on Thursday after criticizing a proposal by conservatives that would notify parents if a student asks to use a name or pronoun that does not align with their birth certificate.
In San Diego, supporters of L.G.B.T.Q. rights were quick to counter opponents. The city council member who represents Rancho Peñasquitos, Marni von Wilpert, condemned the library protest against Pride books and asked the community to help restore the display.
Like many Southern California suburbs, Rancho Peñasquitos, in the northeastern part of San Diego, was once solidly Republican territory. But the community has become more liberal over the years, attracting a diverse range of residents with its highly rated schools and glimpses of the Pacific Ocean. Ms. von Wilpert is the first Democrat to represent District 5, which now includes Rancho Peñasquitos. The neighborhood did have a Democratic council member when it was part of a more liberal district.
The political shift reflects changes in San Diego at large. Long known as a military town with religious roots that date back to the first Spanish mission in California, the city had favored Republicans for most of its history. But like other parts of the state, San Diego has grown more diverse after decades of immigration and the establishment of a booming biotech sector. After victories in 2022, Democrats held all nine seats on the City Council for the first time.
The city also has embraced the L.G.B.T.Q. community; in 2020, voters elected Todd Gloria as San Diego's first openly gay mayor, and have sent Toni Atkins to the State Legislature, where she has become the first lesbian to serve as the leader of each house. Both are Democrats.
Ms. von Wilpert grew up in Rancho Peñasquitos and in 2020 won a closely fought race to represent her home district, where Democrats now have a plurality of registered voters and there are almost as many independents as Republicans. Ms. von Wilpert, who is a member of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, said she appreciated how quickly her neighbors rallied to support the library.
"Suburban, formerly conservative communities are still not buying into this culture war idea that we can't have love and tolerance and acceptance," she said. "That has been amazing."
Conservative groups nationwide have pushed to ban books that discuss L.G.B.T.Q. issues from libraries and schools, saying that parents should be able to control what their children are being taught.
The San Diego residents who sent the email to the Rancho Peñasquitos Library, Amy M. Vance and Martha Martin, did not respond to requests for comment. City officials said they have not heard since from the library patrons.
The text of their email was identical to a template posted online by a right-wing group called CatholicVote, which has an office in Indiana and is not affiliated with the Catholic church. The group has promoted a "Hide the Pride" campaign that encourages supporters to check out or move books that depict L.G.B.T.Q. characters and families. Organizers have described such material as pornographic and obscene and said it should not be available to young library patrons.
"The library needs to use its discretion in how it will make certain content available to people who have very different beliefs about whether this is appropriate for kids," said Brian Burch, the president of CatholicVote.
Among the books on the group's target list are "Julián Is a Mermaid," a picture book about a little boy whose grandmother takes him to a mermaid parade at Coney Island, and "Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress," another picture book about a boy who loves using his imagination and wearing an orange dress to school. Both were checked out by the protesters in San Diego.
Mr. Burch said that his group does not encourage supporters to break the law. But, he said, if one decides to keep a book indefinitely, "that's perfectly fine."
The mission of public libraries is to provide access to any kind of information, even if it is offensive to some, said Misty Jones, the director of the San Diego Public Library. The San Diego library system also does not restrict children from materials that have adult content, according to its library card form.
Librarians say that it has become more difficult to retain open access as book challenges have exploded in the past two years.
Last year, 2,571 unique titles faced censorship attempts -- a 38 percent increase over 2021 and a record high, according to the American Library Association. The A.L.A. also documented 1,269 demands to censor library books or materials, the highest number since the association started collecting data more than two decades ago.
In Greenville, S.C., library board members sought to ban two dozen titles this year, though they ultimately dropped that effort in favor of rules that restrict books on gender identity to adult sections. Last year, a Michigan town defunded its library after librarians refused to remove L.G.B.T.Q.-themed books.
Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who serves as director of the association's office of intellectual freedom, said that the protesters in San Diego and elsewhere have taken advantage of relaxed policies intended to make books more accessible to patrons who cannot afford hefty fines.
In the San Diego Public Library system, card holders get five renewals for materials as long as no one else has requested them. Then, once a book is overdue, library patrons have two more months to return it before it is considered lost, and then they will be billed for it.
"Things intended to broaden access have been weaponized to engage in censorship," Ms. Caldwell-Stone said.
At the Rancho Peñasquitos Library, the Pride display has since been replenished. As for the books checked out last month?
They were recently returned.

Pressured by Biden, AI Companies Agree to Guardrails on New Tools

Seven leading AI companies in the United States have agreed to voluntary safeguards on the technology’s development, the White House announced Friday, pledging to manage the risks of the new tools even as they compete over the potential of artificial intelligence.
The seven companies — Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI — formally announced their commitment to new standards in the areas of safety, security and trust at a meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday afternoon.
“We must be cleareyed and vigilant about the threats emerging from emerging technologies that can pose — don’t have to but can pose — to our democracy and our values,” Biden said in brief remarks from the Roosevelt Room at the White House.
“This is a serious responsibility. We have to get it right,” he said, flanked by the executives from the companies. “And there’s enormous, enormous potential upside as well.”
The announcement comes as the companies are racing to outdo each other with versions of AI that offer powerful new ways to create text, photos, music and video without human input. But the technological leaps have prompted fears about the spread of disinformation and dire warnings of a “risk of extinction” as artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and humanlike.
The voluntary safeguards are only an early, tentative step as Washington and governments across the world seek to put in place legal and regulatory frameworks for the development of artificial intelligence. The agreements include testing products for security risks and using watermarks to make sure consumers can spot AI-generated material.
But lawmakers have struggled to regulate social media and other technologies in ways that keep up with the rapidly evolving technology.
“In the weeks ahead, I’m going to continue to take executive action to help America lead the way toward responsible innovation,” Biden said. “And we’re going to work with both parties to develop appropriate legislation and regulation.”
The White House offered no details of a forthcoming presidential executive order that aims to deal with another problem: How to control the ability of China and other competitors to get ahold of the new AI programs, or the components used to develop them.
The order is expected to involve new restrictions on advanced semiconductors and restrictions on the export of the large language models. Those are hard to secure — much of the software can fit, compressed, on a thumb drive.
An executive order could provoke more opposition from the industry than Friday’s voluntary commitments, which experts said were already reflected in the practices of the companies involved. The promises won’t restrain the plans of the AI companies nor hinder the development of their technologies. And as voluntary commitments, they won’t be enforced by government regulators.
“We are pleased to make these voluntary commitments alongside others in the sector,” Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Meta, the parent company of Facebook, said in a statement. “They are an important first step in ensuring responsible guardrails are established for AI and they create a model for other governments to follow.”
As part of the safeguards, the companies agreed to security testing, in part by independent experts; research on bias and privacy concerns; information sharing about risks with governments and other organizations; development of tools to fight societal challenges such as climate change; and transparency measures to identify AI-generated material.
In a statement announcing the agreements, the Biden administration said the companies must ensure that “innovation doesn’t come at the expense of Americans’ rights and safety.”
“Companies that are developing these emerging technologies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe,” the administration said in a statement.
Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft and one of the executives attending the White House meeting, said his company endorsed the voluntary safeguards.
“By moving quickly, the White House’s commitments create a foundation to help ensure the promise of AI stays ahead of its risks,” Smith said.
Anna Makanju, vice president of global affairs at OpenAI, described the announcement as “part of our ongoing collaboration with governments, civil society organizations and others around the world to advance AI governance.”
For the companies, the standards described Friday serve two purposes: as an effort to forestall, or shape, legislative and regulatory moves with self-policing, and a signal that they are dealing with this new technology thoughtfully and proactively.
But the rules that they agreed on are largely the lowest common denominator, and can be interpreted by every company differently. For example, the firms committed to strict cybersecurity measures around the data used to make the “language models” on which generative AI programs are developed. But there is no specificity about what that means — and the companies would have an interest in protecting their intellectual property anyway.
And even the most careful companies are vulnerable. Microsoft, one of the firms attending the White House event with Biden, scrambled last week to counter a Chinese government-organized hack on the private emails of U.S. officials who were dealing with China. It now appears that China stole, or somehow obtained, a “private key” held by Microsoft that is the key to authenticating emails — one of the company’s most closely guarded pieces of code.
Given such risks, the agreement is unlikely to slow the efforts to pass legislation and impose regulation on the emerging technology.
Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, said that more needed to be done to protect against the dangers that AI posed to society.
“The voluntary commitments announced today are not enforceable, which is why it’s vital that Congress, together with the White House, promptly crafts legislation requiring transparency, privacy protections, and stepped up research on the wide range of risks posed by generative AI,” Barrett said in a statement.
European regulators are poised to adopt AI laws this year, which has prompted many of the companies to encourage U.S. regulations. Several lawmakers have introduced bills that include licensing for AI companies to release their technologies, the creation of a federal agency to oversee the industry, and data privacy requirements. But members of Congress are far from agreement on rules.
Lawmakers have been grappling with how to address the ascent of AI technology, with some focused on risks to consumers while others are acutely concerned about falling behind adversaries, particularly China, in the race for dominance in the field.
This week, the House committee on competition with China sent bipartisan letters to U.S.-based venture capital firms, demanding a reckoning over investments they had made in Chinese AI and semiconductor companies. For months, a variety of House and Senate panels have been questioning the AI industry’s most influential entrepreneurs and critics to determine what sort of legislative guardrails and incentives Congress ought to be exploring.
Many of those witnesses, including Sam Altman of OpenAI, have implored lawmakers to regulate the AI industry, pointing out the potential for the new technology to cause undue harm. But that regulation has been slow to get underway in Congress, where many lawmakers still struggle to grasp what exactly AI technology is.
In an attempt to improve lawmakers’ understanding, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, began a series of sessions for lawmakers this summer, to hear from government officials and experts about the merits and dangers of AI across a number of fields.

Seven leading AI companies in the United States have agreed to voluntary safeguards on the technology’s development, the White House announced Friday, pledging to manage the risks of the new tools even as they compete over the potential of artificial intelligence.
The seven companies — Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI — formally announced their commitment to new standards in the areas of safety, security and trust at a meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday afternoon.
“We must be cleareyed and vigilant about the threats emerging from emerging technologies that can pose — don’t have to but can pose — to our democracy and our values,” Biden said in brief remarks from the Roosevelt Room at the White House.
“This is a serious responsibility. We have to get it right,” he said, flanked by the executives from the companies. “And there’s enormous, enormous potential upside as well.”
The announcement comes as the companies are racing to outdo each other with versions of AI that offer powerful new ways to create text, photos, music and video without human input. But the technological leaps have prompted fears about the spread of disinformation and dire warnings of a “risk of extinction” as self-aware computers evolve.
The voluntary safeguards are only an early, tentative step as Washington and governments across the world rush to put in place legal and regulatory frameworks for the development of artificial intelligence. The agreements include testing products for security risks and using watermarks to make sure consumers can spot AI-generated material.
Friday’s announcement reflects an urgency by the Biden administration and lawmakers to respond to the rapidly evolving technology, even as lawmakers have struggled to regulate social media and other technologies.
“In the weeks ahead, I’m going to continue to take executive action to help America lead the way toward responsible innovation,” Biden said. “And we’re going to work with both parties to develop appropriate legislation and regulation.”
The White House offered no details of a forthcoming presidential executive order that will deal with a bigger problem: How to control the ability of China and other competitors to get ahold of the new AI programs, or the components used to develop them.
That involves new restrictions on advanced semiconductors and restrictions on the export of the large language models. Those are hard to control — much of the software can fit, compressed, on a thumb drive.
An executive order could provoke more opposition from the industry than Friday’s voluntary commitments, which experts said were already reflected in the practices of the companies involved. The promises won’t restrain the plans of the AI companies nor hinder the development of their technologies. And as voluntary commitments, they won’t be enforced by government regulators.

As part of the safeguards, the companies agreed to:
— Security testing of their AI products, in part by independent experts and to share information about their products with governments and others who are attempting to manage the risks of the technology.
— Ensuring that consumers are able to spot AI-generated material by implementing watermarks or other means of identifying generated content.
— Publicly reporting the capabilities and limitations of their systems on a regular basis, including security risks and evidence of bias.
— Deploying advanced artificial intelligence tools to tackle society’s biggest challenges, like curing cancer and combating climate change.
— Conducting research on the risks of bias, discrimination and invasion of privacy from the spread of AI tools.
In a statement announcing the agreements, the Biden administration said the companies must ensure that “innovation doesn’t come at the expense of Americans’ rights and safety.”
“Companies that are developing these emerging technologies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe,” the administration said in a statement.

Schumer has also prepared an amendment to the Senate’s version of this year’s defense authorization bill to incentivize Pentagon employees to report potential issues with AI tools through a “bug bounty” program, commission a Pentagon report on how to improve AI data sharing, and improve reporting on AI in the financial services industry.

Could the Recession in the Distance Be Just a Mirage?

The recession was supposed to have begun by now.
Last year, as Federal Reserve policymakers relentlessly raised interest rates to combat the fastest inflation in decades, forecasters began talking as though a recession — economic contraction rather than growth — was not a question of “if” but “when.” Possibly in 2022. Probably in the first half of 2023. Surely by the end of the year. As recently as December, less than a quarter of economists expected the United States to avoid a recession, a survey found.
But the year is more than half over, and the recession is nowhere to be found. Not, certainly, in the job market, as the unemployment rate, at 3.6%, is hovering near a five-decade low. Not in consumer spending, which continues to grow, nor in corporate profits, which remain robust. Not even in the housing market, the industry that is usually most sensitive to rising interest rates, which has shown signs of stabilizing after slumping last year.
At the same time, inflation has slowed significantly, and looks set to keep cooling — offering hope that interest-rate increases are nearing an end. All of which is leading economists, after a year spent being surprised by the resilience of the recovery, to wonder whether a recession is coming at all.
“The chances of a soft landing are higher — there’s no question about that,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, referring to the possibility of bringing down inflation without causing an economic downturn. “I’m more optimistic than I was six months ago: That’s the good news.”
The public is feeling sunnier too, though hardly ebullient. Measures of consumer confidence have picked up recently, although surveys show that most Americans still expect a recession, or believe the country is already in one.
There is still plenty that could go wrong, which Swonk noted. Inflation could, once again, prove more stubborn than expected, leading the Fed to press on with interest rate increases to curb it. Or, on the flip side, the steps the Fed has already taken could hit with a delay, sharply cooling the economy in a way that has not surfaced yet. And even a slowdown short of a recession could be painful, leading to layoffs that are likely to disproportionately hit Black and Hispanic workers.
“Soft is in the eye of the beholder,” said Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research at the career site Indeed.
Economists are wary of declaring victory prematurely — burned, perhaps, by past episodes in which they have done just that. In early 2008, for example, a string of positive economic data led some forecasters to conclude that the United States had managed to navigate the subprime mortgage crisis without falling into a recession; researchers later concluded that one had already begun.
But for now, at least, talk of worst-case scenarios — runaway inflation that the Fed struggles to tame, or “stagflation” in which prices and unemployment rise in tandem — has been ceding the conversation to cautious optimism.
“We have seen a huge string of shocks, so I can’t predict what the future will hold,” Lael Brainard, a top White House economic adviser, said in an interview last week. “But so far, the data is very much consistent with moderating inflation and a still-resilient job market.”
Inflation has come down.
Economists have become more optimistic for two main reasons.
The first is inflation itself, which has cooled rapidly in recent months. The Consumer Price Index in June was up just 3% from a year earlier, compared with a peak of 9% last summer. That is partly a result of factors that are unlikely to repeat — no one expects oil prices to keep falling at a rate of 30% per year, for example.
But measures of underlying inflation have also shown significant progress. And consumers and businesses appear to expect price increases to return to normal over the next few years, which makes it less likely that inflation will become embedded in the economy.
Cooling inflation could allow the Fed to continue to slow its campaign of interest rate increases, or perhaps even to stop raising rates altogether earlier than planned. That could reduce the chances that policymakers go too far in their effort to control inflation and wind up causing a recession by mistake.
“Things have been going in the direction you would need them to go in order for you to get a soft landing,” said Louise Sheiner, a former Fed economist who is now at the Brookings Institution. “It doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to get it, but certainly it’s more likely than if inflation was still 7%.”
The job market has been resilient.
The second reason for optimism has been the gradual cooling of the labor market from a rolling boil to a strong simmer.
The rapid reopening of the economy in 2021 led to a huge imbalance between supply and demand: Restaurants, hotels, airlines and other businesses suddenly had hundreds of thousand of jobs to fill, and not enough people to fill them. For workers, it was a rare moment of leverage, resulting in the fastest wage growth in decades. But economists worried that those rapid gains could make it hard to get inflation under control.
In recent months, however, the frenzy has subsided. Employers are not posting as many job openings. Employees are not hopping from job to job as freely in search of higher pay. At the same time, millions of workers have joined or rejoined the workforce, helping to ease the labor shortage.
So far, however, that easing has happened without a significant increase in unemployment. The jobless rate is roughly where it was in the strong labor market that preceded the pandemic. Some industries, such as tech and finance, have laid off employees, but most of those workers have found other jobs relatively quickly.
“Labor market overheating is diminishing substantially, to levels where it’s no longer so worrisome,” said Jan Hatzius, chief economist for Goldman Sachs.
Hatzius, who has long been more optimistic about the prospects for a soft landing than many of his peers on Wall Street, on Monday lowered his estimated probability of a recession to 20%, from 25%. He said the recent progress in inflation and the labor market — as well as in consumer spending and other areas — suggests the economy is gradually moving past the disruptions of the past few years.
“We’re seeing the other side of the pandemic,” he said. “The pandemic created all of this enormous turbulence in economies, and now I think it’s going away, and to me that’s the overriding theme.”
Risks remain.
Still, many economists are less sanguine. Inflation, at least excluding volatile food and energy prices, remains well above the Fed’s 2% annual target, at 4.8% in June. And although the progress on inflation so far may have been relatively painless, there is no guarantee that will continue — employers that initially responded to higher interest rates by hiring fewer workers may soon begin cutting jobs outright.
“People taking victory laps declaring a soft landing I think are premature,” said Laurence M. Ball, a Johns Hopkins economist who last year wrote an influential paper concluding that it would be difficult for the Fed to get inflation back to 2% without a significant increase in unemployment.
Part of the problem is that the Fed has little margin for error. Act too aggressively to tame inflation, and the central bank could push the economy into a recession. Do too little, and inflation could pick back up — forcing policymakers to clamp back down.
Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro, says he worries the strong labor market will fuel a new acceleration in the economy, leading to a resumption of rapid price increases — an “inflationary boom” that looks reverses much of the recent progress.
“The next three to six months, the inflation dynamics will look pretty good — it will feel like a soft landing,” he added. “The question is, what comes after?”
Then there are the factors outside of policymakers’ control. Oil prices, which soared last year when Russia invaded Ukraine, could do so again. Food prices could start rising again, too — a possibility that became more real this week when Russia canceled a deal to allow Ukraine to export grain on the Black Sea.
With the economy already slowing, even relatively small developments — such as the looming resumption of student loan payments, which will strain the finances of many younger adults in particular — could be enough to knock the recovery off course, said Jay Bryson, chief economist for Wells Fargo.
“The student loan thing is not, in and of itself, enough to cause a recession, but if you do have a downturn, it could be a kind of death by a thousand paper cuts,” he said.
Bryson still expects a recession to start this year. But he has become less certain in recent months. He recently asked the nearly 20 people on his team to write down how likely they thought a recession was in the next year. Answers ranged from 30%% to 65%, with an average of exactly 50% — coin-flip odds for a soft landing that many people once thought impossible.
“Keep the Champagne on ice,” Bryson said. “Hopefully early next year we can start popping it.”

Global Domination Begins at Home: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Popular content produced in Asia and around the world has taken on greater significance with most of Hollywood now on strike.
They met in a 20th-floor conference room in Seoul named for one successful project with Korean talent -- "Okja," a 2017 film of one girl's devotion to a genetically modified super pig -- to discuss what they hoped would become another hit.
Quickly, the gathering of Netflix's South Korea team became an unhappy focus group, with a barrage of nitpicks and critiques about the script for a coming-of-age fantasy show.
One person said the story line pulled in too many fantastical -- and foreign -- elements instead of focusing on character and plot. The creative components struck another person as too hard to grasp, and out of touch.
Finally, the executive who was championing the project offered a diagnosis: The writer had watched too much Netflix.
Inspired by the streaming service's success in turning Korean-language shows into international hits, the writer wanted this show to go global, too, and thought more far-fetched flourishes would appeal overseas.
The fix, the executive said, was the opposite. The script needed to "Koreanize" the show, ground it in local realism and turn some foreign characters into Korean roles.
It's a turbulent time in Hollywood, with television and movie actors now on strike, joining the screenwriters who have been picketing since May. Netflix has become a focal point of frustration for the ways streaming services have upended the traditional television model.
Amid this uncertainty, Netflix remains locked in its goal: It wants to dominate the entertainment world, but it is pursuing that ambition one country at a time. Instead of creating shows and movies that appeal to all 190 countries where the service is available, Netflix is focusing on content that resonates with a single market's audience.
The overseas content has taken on even greater significance with Hollywood effectively shut down. The comedies and dramas produced outside the United States, like the ideas being decided on in that Seoul conference room, could be some of the only new content on offer.
In April, before the writers went on strike, Ted Sarandos, one of Netflix's co-chief executives, said he hoped it wouldn't come to that -- but also promised that viewers wouldn't be without options. "We have a large base of upcoming shows and films from around the world," he said.
That large base comes from around the world, but is specific to each country it comes from.
"When we're making shows in Korea, we're going to make sure it's for Koreans," said Minyoung Kim, Netflix's vice president of content in Asia. "When we're making shows in Japan, it is going to be for the Japanese. In Thailand, it's going to be for Thai people. We are not trying to make everything global."
Netflix's 2023 Emmy nominations tell one story of its ambitions: It received nods Wednesday for its prestige drama "The Crown," its comedy-drama "Beef" and its reality shows "Love Is Blind" and "Queer Eye."
In addition to that wide spectrum of English-language programming, Netflix's ambition is to expand in relatively untapped regions like Asia and Latin America, beyond its saturated core markets in the United States and Europe, where subscriber growth is slowing. It is allocating more of its $ 17 billion annual content budget to expanding its foreign language programming and attracting customers abroad.
But the company is also betting that a compelling story somewhere is compelling everywhere, no matter the language.
This year, Netflix developed "The Glory," a binge-worthy revenge saga about a woman striking back against childhood bullies, which cracked the top five most-watched non-English-language TV shows ever on the service. Before that, at one point "Extraordinary Attorney Woo," a feel-good show about a lawyer with autism, was in the weekly Top 10 chart in 54 countries. Last year, 60 percent of Netflix subscribers watched a Korean-language show or movie.
In building an audience abroad, Netflix has a head start on other major streaming platforms, although Disney and Amazon have announced plans to build their catalogs of international content. In many Asian markets, Netflix is also competing with a local streaming option -- often created by broadcasters wary of ceding control to foreign media giants.
Asia, Netflix's fastest-growing region, is a key battleground because customers watch a higher percentage of programming in their native tongues. Netflix already has shows in more than 30 Asian languages.
That's where Ms. Kim, 42, comes in.
Ms. Kim joined Netflix in 2016. Her job is, essentially, to help Netflix do something that has never been done before: build a truly global entertainment service with shows in every market, while selling Americans on the appeal of foreign-language content. If she is daunted by the demand, she doesn't show it.
She is chatty and direct, with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of Korean television dramas. But perhaps most importantly for her task, she is the woman who gave the Netflix-watching world "Squid Game."
'Don't expect miracles'
In 2016, Netflix rented Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a Seoul landmark and futuristic exhibition space, for a red-carpet affair featuring the stars of one of its biggest shows at the time: "Orange Is the New Black."
The hors d'oeuvres were served, on theme with the show, on food trays meant to mimic prison. Netflix was arriving in South Korea's entertainment industry with a big splash. But the tongue-in-cheek humor felt inhospitable and culturally out of touch, according to industry people who attended. It left the impression of an American company that did not understand Korea.
It was a clumsy start. A few months later, when Ms. Kim began in her role as Netflix's first content executive in Asia with a focus on South Korea, she warned the company's executives: "Don't expect miracles."
Ms. Kim said she needed to make Netflix feel less foreign and sell creators on why they should work with the company.
She traveled to visit producers at their offices instead of summoning them to see her. She arranged regular boozy dinners with producers -- the custom in South Korea -- knowing that it was difficult to gain their trust until they got drunk with her.
Over lunch, where she had a steaming bowl of beef offal soup, she described her strategy.
"Here, you first have to build a relationship," Ms. Kim said. "At the time, I think the way we approached things felt very transactional and aggressive. When it comes to Asian partners, oftentimes it's more than just the money we put on the table."
Early in her tenure, she came across a movie script called "Squid Game" by Hwang Dong-hyuk, a respected local filmmaker. He had written it a decade earlier and could never find a studio to finance it. She said she immediately loved the irony of a gory "death game" thriller based around traditional Korean children's games. She thought the concept might work better as a TV show, allowing for more character development than a two-hour film.
But it seemed like a strange choice for one of her first big bets. Similar titles were in the young-adult genre, such as "The Hunger Games" or "Battle Royale," a Japanese cult film in which a group of students fight to the death.
"Who wants to see a death game with poor old people?" she recalled being asked by a member of her team.
But after she saw the set designs, she was convinced that it would be a big hit in South Korea. Netflix decided to change the English title to "Round Six" to appeal to an international audience. Near the release date, Mr. Hwang asked to change the title back because he felt that "Squid Game" was closer to the show's essence.
Much to everyone's surprise, "Squid Game" garnered an enormous number of views in South Korea and across the world. It was a sensation that broke into the cultural zeitgeist, complete with a "Saturday Night Live" skit and Halloween costumes. And Netflix finally threw the right kind of party for the show's Korean cast: an after-party, after dominating last year's Emmy Awards.
"Squid Game" changed everything. It became the most-watched show ever on Netflix, and it spurred interest in other Korean content. In April, to coincide with a visit to the United States by South Korea's president, Yoon Suk Yeol, Netflix said it was planning to invest $ 2.5 billion in Korean shows and movies in the next four years, which is double its investment since 2016.
After decades of Hollywood's delivering blockbusters to the world, Netflix is trying to flip the model. Mr. Sarandos said that "Squid Game" proved that a hit show could emerge from anywhere and in any language and that the odds of success for a Hollywood show versus an international show were not that different.
"That's really never been done before," he said at an investor conference in December. "Locally produced content can play big all over the world, so it's not just America supplying the rest of world content."
'Green-light rigor'
Global expansion requires a guiding principle. For Ms. Kim, that's "green-light rigor," a mind-set she brought to Netflix's office in the Roppongi district of Tokyo, where she moved last year to oversee the content teams in Asia-Pacific except for India.
In some Asian countries, she explained, Netflix has a more limited budget, so the company has to select only the "must-haves" and pass on "nice-to-haves." Green-light rigor also means not pandering to what Netflix imagines viewers across the world want.
How that discipline played out in practice was on display when the Japanese content team met to discuss whether to option a book for a show in late January.
The book in question was a love story set in a dystopian world with elements of science fiction. A data analyst said that based on the show's projected "value," he wondered whether Netflix would recoup its investment because of the sizable budgets usually required for science fiction.
Kaata Sakamoto, who heads the Japanese content team, said he worried about the mismatched expectations of viewers who might come expecting a romance drama and then find themselves in hard-core science fiction.
"It's like someone who goes into a restaurant and they are served food that is different from what they want to eat," he said. "If this is a 'Romeo and Juliet' tale, do we need a big sci-fi world setting? It feels like mixed soup."
The executive pitching the project said the writer watched "a lot of Netflix" and was aware of what was popular. So instead of a pure love story, he wanted to infuse elements of dystopian science fiction -- a popular genre on Netflix.
But Mr. Sakamoto, who played an active role in producing some of Netflix's hits from Japan, seemed unconvinced.
"My question is what is it about this project that is uniquely Japanese?" he asked.
Netflix's Tokyo office exudes an American vibe, but very little English is spoken in the creative meetings. This was the case when Mr. Sakamoto met with Shinsuke Sato, creator of "Alice in Borderland," a science-fiction survival thriller that was Netflix's biggest hit in Japan, to discuss a coming project.
It was a free-flowing discussion that touched on minute details of the project, from character development to plot twists to which scary animals would work best in computer graphics -- reptiles could be easier than furry creatures, suggested Akira Mori, a producer who works with Mr. Sato. ("Maybe an alligator?")
Later, Mr. Sakamoto said that in the past, a lot of talented Japanese who were successful in Japan had struggled to break through in Hollywood because they didn't speak English well.
"But what Netflix has allowed is that creators can make work in their own countries in their own language, and if the storytelling is good and the quality is there, they can reach a global audience," he said. "This is a major game changer."
Vision come to life
The increased expectations are apparent throughout Netflix's high-rise office in Seoul. The meeting rooms are named after its prominent Korean movies and shows. In the canteen, a human-size replica of the doll from "Squid Game" looms over a selection of Korean snacks and instant noodles.
Ms. Kim's vision of creating a diverse slate of Korean shows has come to life. "Physical: 100," a gladiator-style game show in which contestants fight for survival and a cash prize, was in the Top 10 of non-English shows for six weeks. This year, at least three Korean shows have been among the top-10 foreign language shows every week.
"It's exciting, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the pressure," said Don Kang, Netflix's vice president of content in South Korea, who has succeeded Ms. Kim in overseeing South Korea.
Mr. Kang, who is soft-spoken with a baby face, joined in 2018 after heading international sales at CJ ENM, a Korean entertainment conglomerate. When he started, Netflix was still operating out of a WeWork office.
He said that before Netflix, he thought there wouldn't be much international interest in Korean reality shows or shows that weren't romantic comedies.
"I was very happy to be proven wrong," Mr. Kang said.
Netflix's slate of Korean programs runs the gamut from romantic comedies to dark shows like "Hellbound," an adaptation of a digital comic book about supernatural beings condemning people to hell. Yeon Sang-ho, the director of "Hellbound," said such niche content wouldn't be made by Korean broadcasters because the audience wasn't big enough to justify the budget.
"Netflix has a worldwide audience, which means that we can try more genres and we can try more nonmainstream things, too," Mr. Yeon said. "Creators who work with Netflix can now try the risky things that they wanted to do but they weren't able to."
Netflix's success has reshaped South Korea's entertainment industry. TV production budgets have increased as much as tenfold per episode in the last few years, said Lee Young-lyoul, a professor at the Seoul Institute of the Arts, and there is growing concern that domestic broadcasters will struggle to compete.
Production companies need Netflix's investments to hire top writers, directors and actors, creating a "vicious cycle of dependency," according to "Netflix and Platform Imperialism," an academic paper published in The International Journal of Communication this year.
The extraordinary success of "Extraordinary Attorney Woo" highlights the tensions.
AStory, the show's production company, rejected Netflix's offer to finance the entire second season, because of its previous experience with the service. AStory made "Kingdom," a hit Korean zombie period show, as a Netflix original, meaning Netflix owned all the show's intellectual property rights in exchange for paying the full production costs.
"While it's true that Netflix helped the series get popular, our company couldn't do anything with that," said Lee Sang-baek, AStory's chief executive. "There are lots of regrets there."
Mr. Kang said that Netflix had a good relationship with AStory and that the situation was complex. He said Netflix had been "very, very generous" in compensating creators and actors but emphasized the need to grow in a "sustainable" way.
"You do sometimes hear those types of concerns: Is Netflix taking too much from our industry? But you can't be in this business and operate that way," Mr. Kang said.
'Too Hot to Handle' around the world
One by one, Ms. Kim rattled off the unique traits of audiences around the region. Korean audiences prefer happy endings in romance. Japanese dramas tend to portray emotion in an understated way. Chinese-language viewers are more accepting of a sad love story. ("The Taiwanese staff always says a romance has to be sad. Somebody has to die.")
Ms. Kim understands that local stories share universal themes, but the key to Netflix's work is to understand these cultural differences.
When Netflix's "Too Hot to Handle," a tawdry reality dating show with contestants from the United States and Britain, did well in South Korea and Japan, the company decided to make its own shows in the respective countries. But instead of programs replete with sex and hooking up, Netflix's versions in South Korea ("Singles Inferno") and Japan ("Terrace House") were more suited to local sensibilities: only hints of romance with minimal touching or flirting.
Storytelling can also differ. Impressions of the first episode of "Physical: 100" were divided by geography. Ms. Kim said she found that in general, American audiences thought the extensive back stories about the contestants slowed the show. Korean audiences liked the back stories because they wanted to know more about the contestants.
Ms. Kim recalled how Netflix's U.S. executives asked her why the first Squid Game contest did not come until the last 20 minutes of the first episode. She was puzzled, because this was fast for Korean audiences -- but not fast enough for American sensibilities. In South Korea, the action often does not start until the fourth episode because shows often follow the cadence of a story arc suited to a 16-episode broadcast TV schedule.
Ms. Kim said she thought that audiences would tolerate work that defied their expectations or values when it was foreign, but that it must be authentic when it was local.
So far, that philosophy has been successful. "Squid Game" proves that. But it also shows the new challenge that awaits Netflix -- once something is a global hit, there are global expectations.
Leonardo DiCaprio is a fan, and Mr. Hwang, the writer-director, even teased that the Hollywood A-lister could join the "games," a boost that most people chasing global domination might find hard to resist. But Netflix did manage it -- for now.
Last month, when the cast was announced, it featured all Korean actors.

SEOUL, South Korea — They met in a 20th-floor conference room in Seoul named for one successful project with Korean talent — “Okja,” a 2017 film of one girl’s devotion to a genetically modified super pig — to discuss what they hoped would become another hit.
Quickly, the gathering of Netflix’s South Korea team became an unhappy focus group, with a barrage of nitpicks and critiques about the script for a coming-of-age fantasy show.
One person said the storyline pulled in too many fantastical — and foreign — elements instead of focusing on character and plot. The creative components struck another person as too hard to grasp, and out of touch.
Finally, the executive who was championing the project offered a diagnosis: The writer had watched too much Netflix.
Inspired by the streaming service’s success in turning Korean-language shows into international hits, the writer wanted this show to go global, too, and thought more far-fetched flourishes would appeal overseas.
The fix, the executive said, was the opposite. The script needed to “Koreanize” the show, ground it in local realism and turn some foreign characters into Korean roles.
It’s a turbulent time in Hollywood, with television and movie actors now on strike, joining the screenwriters who have picketing since May. Netflix has become a focal point of frustration for the ways streaming services have upended the traditional television model.
Amid this uncertainty, Netflix remains locked in its goal: It wants to dominate the entertainment world, but it is pursuing that ambition one country at a time. Instead of creating shows and movies that appeal to all 190 countries where the service is available, Netflix is focusing on content that resonates with a single market’s audience.
The overseas content has taken on even greater significance with Hollywood effectively shut down. The comedies and dramas produced overseas, like the ideas being decided on in that Seoul conference room, could be some of the only new content on offer.
In April, before the writers went on strike, Ted Sarandos, one of Netflix’s co-CEOs, said he hoped it wouldn’t come to that — but also promised that viewers wouldn’t be without options. “We have a large base of upcoming shows and films from around the world,” he said.
That large base comes from around the world but is specific to each country it comes from.
“When we’re making shows in Korea, we’re going to make sure it’s for Koreans,” said Minyoung Kim, Netflix’s vice president of content in Asia. “When we’re making shows in Japan, it is going to be for the Japanese. In Thailand, it’s going to be for Thai people. We are not trying to make everything global.”
Netflix’s 2023 Emmy nominations tell one story of its ambitions: It received nods Wednesday for its prestige drama “The Crown,” its comedy-drama “Beef,” and its reality shows “Love Is Blind” and “Queer Eye.”
In addition to that wide spectrum of English-language programming, Netflix’s ambition is to expand in relatively untapped regions such as Asia and Latin America, beyond its saturated core markets in the United States and Europe, where subscriber growth is slowing. It is allocating more of its $17 billion annual content budget to expanding its foreign language programming and attracting customers abroad.
But the company is also betting that a compelling story somewhere is compelling everywhere, no matter the language.
This year, Netflix developed “The Glory,” a binge-worthy revenge saga about a woman striking back against childhood bullies, which cracked the Top 5 most-watched non-English-language TV shows ever on the service. Before that, at one point “Extraordinary Attorney Woo,” a feel-good show about a lawyer with autism, was in the weekly Top 10 chart in 54 countries. Last year, 60% of Netflix subscribers watched a Korean-language show or movie.
In building an audience abroad, Netflix has a head start on other major streaming platforms, although Disney and Amazon have announced plans to build their catalogs of international content. In many Asian markets, Netflix is also competing with a local streaming option — often created by broadcasters wary of ceding control to foreign media giants.
Asia, Netflix’s fastest-growing region, is a key battleground because customers watch a higher percentage of programming in their native tongues. Netflix already has shows in more than 30 Asian languages.

And Netflix finally threw the right kind of party for the show’s Korean cast: an after-party, after dominating last year’s Emmy Awards.
“Squid Game” changed everything. It became the most-watched show on Netflix, and it spurred interest in other Korean content. In April, to coincide with a visit to the United States by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Netflix said it was planning to invest $2.5 billion in Korean shows and movies in the next four years, which is double its investment since 2016.
After decades of Hollywood’s delivering blockbusters to the world, Netflix is trying to flip the model.

But Sakamoto, who played an active role in producing some of Netflix’s hits from Japan, seemed unconvinced.
“My question is: What is it about this project that is uniquely Japanese?” he asked.
Netflix’s Tokyo office exudes an American vibe, but very little English is spoken in the creative meetings. This was the case when Sakamoto met with Shinsuke Sato, creator of “Alice in Borderland,” a science-fiction survival thriller that was Netflix’s biggest hit in Japan, to discuss a coming project.
It was a free-flowing discussion that touched on minute details of the project, from character development to plot twists to which scary animals would work best in computer graphics — reptiles could be easier than furry creatures, suggested Akira Mori, a producer who works with Sato.

“But what Netflix has allowed is that creators can make work in their own countries in their own language, and if the storytelling is good and the quality is there, they can reach a global audience,” he said. “This is a major game changer.”
Vision come to life
The increased expectations are apparent throughout Netflix’s high-rise office in Seoul. The meeting rooms are named after its prominent Korean movies and shows. In the canteen, a human-size replica of the doll from “Squid Game” looms over a selection of Korean snacks and instant noodles.

“It’s exciting, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel the pressure,” said Don Kang, Netflix’s vice president of content in South Korea, who has succeeded Kim in overseeing South Korea.

But instead of programs replete with sex and hooking up, Netflix’s versions in South Korea (“Singles Inferno”) and Japan (“Terrace House”) were more suited to local sensibilities: only hints of romance with minimal touching or flirting.
Storytelling can also differ. Impressions of the first episode of “Physical: 100” were divided by geography. Kim said she found that in general, American audiences thought the extensive backstories about the contestants slowed the show. Korean audiences liked the backstories because they wanted to know more about the contestants.
Kim recalled how Netflix’s U.S. executives asked her why the first Squid Game contest did not come until the last 20 minutes of the first episode. She was puzzled, because this was fast for Korean audiences — but not fast enough for American sensibilities. In South Korea, the action often does not start until the fourth episode because shows often follow the cadence of a story arc suited to a 16-episode broadcast TV schedule.
Kim said she thought that audiences would tolerate work that defied their expectations or values when it was foreign, but that it must be authentic when it was local.
So far, that philosophy has been successful. “Squid Game” proves that. But it also shows the new challenge that awaits Netflix — once something is a global hit, there are global expectations.
Leonardo DiCaprio is a fan, and Hwang, the writer-director, even teased that the Hollywood A-lister could join the “games,” a boost that most people chasing global domination might find hard to resist. But Netflix did manage it — for now.
Last month, when the cast was announced, it featured all Korean actors.

U.A.W. Talks Quite Likely To Be Testy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The U.A.W., with a more confrontational leader, aims to win back wage and benefit concessions and insulate jobs from the rise of electric vehicles.
The three Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have begun negotiating a new labor contract in what could become the most contentious talks between the two sides in perhaps half a century.
The discussions, which formally started on Thursday, come as General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis have posted a long streak of strong profits in North America, and after the U.A.W. elected a president who has vowed to win back many of the wage and benefit concessions the union has ceded over the last two decades.
Shawn Fain, an outsider candidate, prevailed in an upset election victory over the incumbent U.A.W. president this year largely by promising to take a more militant approach to contract negotiations than his recent predecessors. Since then, he has expressed a readiness to shut down factories to achieve the goals of the union, which represents 150,000 hourly workers employed by the three Detroit companies.
"If the Big Three don't give us our fair share, then they are choosing to strike themselves," Mr. Fain, 54, said Wednesday as he greeted workers ending their shift at a G.M. electric vehicle plant in Detroit. "We are not afraid to take action. Our union is united. We can't be afraid to stand up and fight."
A day later, Mr. Fain underscored his view by breaking with tradition and declining to take part in the usual ceremonial opening of negotiations, where in the past the U.A.W.'s president shook hands with the automakers' chief executives as a gesture of harmony for photographers and television cameras before the two sides got down to bargaining.
"I'm not shaking hands with any C.E.O.s until they do right by our members and we fix the broken status quo," Mr. Fain said.
The bargaining is taking place as the labor movement is showing renewed strength in the United States. A strike by Hollywood writers against movie and television producers just entered its third month. Hollywood actors went on strike on Friday. Graduate student teachers -- some represented by the U.A.W. -- have been on strike at universities across the country since April. Hotel workers in Los Angeles walked off the job for three days in June.
In the last few years, more than 300 Starbucks stores as well as some Trader Joe's stores, Chipotle restaurants and an Amazon warehouse in New York have unionized. The Teamsters union is threatening to strike against UPS in August if the two cannot agree on a new contract.
"We are seeing in very diverse workplaces a new interest in unions and a willingness to strike," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the labor movement for more than three decades. "What we don't know yet is how large this movement is going to become and how far it is going to go."
The negotiations coincide with the start of the 2024 presidential election campaign. The U.A.W. traditionally backs the Democratic candidate, but the union has withheld an endorsement of President Biden to push the White House to up its support of unions.
In Detroit, the contract talks are playing out amid a momentous transition to electric vehicles. G.M., Ford and Stellantis have been investing billions of dollars in new technologies and battery plants, although so far they have introduced only a handful of new E.V.s, sales of these vehicles are growing but low, and none of the three automakers has yet made money off E.V.s.
This transition presents a concern for the union because E.V.s have far fewer parts than conventional autos -- they have no exhaust system, no transmission, no fuel system -- and require fewer workers to produce them. G.M., Ford and Stellantis have started building battery plants with joint-venture partners, which are not automatically covered by the U.A.W.'s labor contract.
The union has organized a G.M. battery plant in Ohio, but workers there must negotiate their wage rates and terms separately from the main U.A.W. agreement.
"Electrification presents problems," said Earl Fuller Jr., the G.M. chairman at Local 160 in Warren, Mich. "We see jobs going away, and that needs to be addressed."
While investing heavily in E.V.s, the automakers are still generating substantial profits off sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, helped by near-record prices of new vehicles. Over the last 10 years, G.M. and Ford have typically made a pretax profit of $ 7 billion to $ 11 billion a year in North America. Stellantis, the smallest of the three, has usually earned somewhat less, although its pretax results in the region topped $ 13 billion in 2021 and 2022.
Mr. Shaiken said the union had considerable leverage in the negotiations. "The stakes are very high for the auto manufacturers with this E.V. transition taking place," he said. "A strike could be very costly for the companies."
In his estimation, a strike is likely but not certain.
The automakers maintain that they bear a disadvantage in labor costs. According to Ford, its hourly cost of U.A.W. labor is $ 64, and it estimates that is $ 9 more than the labor cost for foreign-owned automakers with nonunion plants in the United States, and $ 14 to $ 19 more than that of Tesla, which also uses nonunion workers.
In a statement, Ford noted that it had 57,000 hourly U.A.W. workers, more than its two Detroit rivals, and that it produced more vehicles in the United States than the others as well.
"We look forward to working with the U.A.W. on creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive work force more than ever," the company said.
Stellantis said it aimed to negotiate a contract that ensured its future competitiveness as well as good wages and benefits. "Together, we must approach these negotiations with open minds," the automaker said.
In the past, G.M., Ford and Stellantis have often lost money, or made little. Each needed concessions from the union to survive, and the union steadily agreed to many of the automakers' demands in a series of contracts beginning in 2003.
The cost of health care for U.A.W. retirees has been shifted from the automakers to a union trust fund. The union agreed to allow the manufacturers to start new hires at about half the $ 32 hourly rate that veteran workers earn. New workers get 401(k) accounts for retirement instead of guaranteed pensions. While the manufacturers have been paying substantial profit-sharing bonuses -- sometimes more than $ 10,000 for each worker -- the U.A.W. has gone without cost-of-living adjustments that in the past protected workers from inflation.
In contract talks four years ago, the union sought to regain ground on those issues. The automakers agreed to increases in hourly wages and profit-sharing, improved terms for temporary workers and modified wage tiers but stopped short of scrapping them for a single wage rate.
Workers at G.M. also demanded that the company reverse a plan to close a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, and went on strike for 40 days but ended up ratifying a contract that allowed the shuttering of the plant.
The 2019 contract did include provisions for G.M. to invest $ 3 billion in its plant in Detroit, which had also been designated for possible closing. The money was used to convert the site into G.M.'s flagship E.V. plant, now called Factory Zero, which produces an electric Cadillac S.U.V. as well as the electric GMC Hummer.
Margaret Hudgins-Washington, 56, a battery operator at the plant, was one of several dozen who stopped to talk to Mr. Fain on Wednesday. She has worked there for about a year, makes about $ 16 an hour and wants to see an end to the two-tier wage structure.
"Our workers have regressed with inflation," she said. "So I think we need better pay."
She and many others uniformly endorsed Mr. Fain's tougher approach.
"I think he's doing the right thing," said Kevin Winston, an electrician and a father of five from Brownstown, Mich. "Now is the time. I'm ready to strike, 100 percent, and I haven't heard any people say we shouldn't strike."

Is It a Crying Shame, Or a Laughing Matter?: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The difference between comedy and drama is hazier than ever, as is the future of the Emmy Awards ceremony itself.
The 2023 Primetime Emmy nominations were announced on Wednesday. James Poniewozik and Margaret Lyons, two television critics for The New York Times, discussed who made it and who didn't, the limp limited-series slate, reality TV blind spots and all those acting nominations for "Succession" and "The White Lotus."
JAMES PONIEWOZIK Weirder than usual Emmys season this year, Margaret! The writers are on strike. The actors might follow them. We don't even know when or if the actual awards show will happen. And yet the nominations have come chugging along, to remind us what TV was like when there were people making it.
Meanwhile, TV is going through a period of retrenchment, with cost-cutting at Warner Bros. Discovery and elsewhere. So however credible the Emmys are as an award, they could make a bigger difference in who gets a budget and who gets the ax.
Now that I have the cheerful stuff out of the way: The TV biz may be filled with uncertainty, but I don't see a lot of big shockers among the major nominees. But I'll start with a happy surprise -- let's hear it for "Jury Duty," the sneaky faux-documentary comedy that was designed to seem neither written nor acted but that pulled off its audacious stunt on the strength of both crafts.
MARGARET LYONS It is indeed a weird time for TV! I feel like we are watching two circles in a Venn diagram drift apart: The people who care about TV and the people who make money off TV. And the Emmys are carrying on as usual like divorcing parents agreeing to be polite at their daughter's wedding, even though everyone is mad, everyone knows exactly how poorly some parties have behaved, dad wants to bring his new girlfriend, Discovery+, and also it's a cash bar.
But "Jury Duty"! I'm especially thrilled it was nominated for casting -- I'd argue that was its greatest and most essential achievement across its many successes. I did sort of chuckle, though, that it is up against "Barry" and "The Bear," shows that feel so foundationally different from an ensemble of goofy jurors that it seems outrageous for them to all be in competition.
I'm also surprised that "Atlanta" only notched one nomination (for cinematography) in its final season. But there are a lot of banner shows for whom this is their last Emmys.
PONIEWOZIK I could run through a whole list of nays and hoorays, but I want to look big picture first. A running theme in our Emmy chats lately has been how much stronger the limited-series nominees were than everything else. I do not think that's true this year! To me, "Beef" is the class of the field among what's nominated, which also includes the garish "Dahmer," the middling "Daisy Jones & the Six" and (LOL) "Obi-Wan Kenobi." None of those last few come close to "Dead Ringers," the sanguinary David Cronenberg re-imagination that was the rare case of a TV adaptation with something original to say. It got a single nod, like "Atlanta," for cinematography.
LYONS I'm with you: "Beef" is the standout in its category for me, too.
There is always some blurriness between comedy and drama, but exactly where that gray area is changes from year to year. Sometimes all the comedies are kind of bummers or many dramas are quite snappy; sometimes the length distinction feels arbitrary at best. What struck me this year is the chasm between comedy and drama in the guest performer categories -- obviously a real apples-and-oranges, but it points to a major format trend between the disciplines.
Dramas have significant "departure" episodes, exemplified by "The Last of Us," and comedies have what amounts to celebrity cameos, like Taraji P. Henson on "Abbott Elementary." "The Bear" is not a ha-ha comedy, but Jon Bernthal's nod for guest actor feels very "comedy" because of how that character operates within the fabric of the show.
PONIEWOZIK Yeah, Margaret, every Emmys these days is a pretty good argument against separate comedy and drama categories. For me, "The Diplomat" is more a comedy, yet there it is in drama. Is "Bad Sisters" more a drama than "Barry"? I guess, but you can measure the distance in millimeters.
But speaking of dramas that are among the funniest things on TV: We won't be helping our chances in Google search unless we start talking "Succession." The saga of the Roy family ends, appropriately enough, with its whole family scrapping for a limited amount of acting prizes. This time Shiv, I mean Sarah Snook, has an edge, as the only member of the clan up for best actress. (Watch out for Bella Ramsey of "The Last of Us," though. You may have a shiv but Ellie has a knife!)
If it is the year of "Succession," which Roy deserves best actor? I'm not going to shade Brian Cox--I am afraid to -- but Logan was by necessity more a supporting figure in the final season, holding sway in absentia. Between Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong I guess I slightly lean Strong, partly for how painfully he conveyed Kendall's doomed hungry ambition, partly as payback for everyone who made fun of him for taking acting seriously and correctly using the word "dramaturgically."
One thing I'm sure of is that the "Connor's Wedding" episode should (and probably will) take every category it can. But I do have to laugh at the supporting-drama-actor category: Eight nominees, all from "Succession" or "The White Lotus." There was acting going on elsewhere on TV last season, I swear it! (But congratulations in advance to Matthew Macfadyen.)
LYONS For me, best actor is Strong by a light-year -- not to put down any of the other performances, but his control of the register of Kendall's voice alone deserves an Emmy in my book. And while I know what you mean about "Succession" overload in supporting actor, going through the list of submitted roles, I'm not convinced there's someone who was clearly snubbed. Though I'm starting to worry that "For All Mankind" will never know a moment of Emmy glory ever, and that bums me out.
The Emmys have a lot of blind spots, but the refusal to engage meaningfully with reality programming drives me crazy. "Love Is Blind" is nominated over "Couples Therapy"? Come on! And in the reality competition category, what does "Alone" have to do to get a little love?
PONIEWOZIK Yup! The Emmys have come a long way -- or at least a way -- from the days of handing statues to "Modern Family" in perpetuity. But competition reality is now one of the most set-in-stone categories, and there again are "Survivor," "The Amazing Race" and "RuPaul's Drag Race." I confess I'm not up on "Alone"; I am but one man with but two eyes. But I would have loved to have seen them open the books for "The Traitors" -- like "The Mole" in a Scottish castle, with Alan Cumming hamming it up as if he were in a John Waters production of "Macbeth." (It got a single nomination, for casting.)
As everyone out there compiles their own lists of grudges, here's the standard reminder that the Emmys calendar is not the same as Regular Human Person Calendar. The eligibility period runs from June through the following May. So you've gotta have a good memory!
"The Bear," for instance, is eligible not for the just-released Season 2 (which was astounding) but for last year's Season 1 (which was perfectly good). The comedy category is full of shows nominated for seasons that are not their peak: "Abbott Elementary" (still lovable but off its Season 1 pace), "Barry" (a great achievement with some rough patches in its final run) and "Ted Lasso" (dear God).
LYONS Beyond the sometimes confusing calendar, I also want to mention the sometimes-confounding category rules. For example, "I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson" is indeed an Emmy nominee, but not in scripted variety series with "Black Lady Sketch Show" or "Saturday Night Live" -- it counts as a short form comedy, drama or variety series because its episodes are under 20 minutes. Tim Robinson is also nominated, but again, in a short form category.
So sure! To understand the Emmys is to accept their shortcomings, and to that end I'd say this feels like a quintessential selection: A few bright surprises, a few heavy hitters, some shows that are coasting on name recognition ("Wednesday," come on now) or lingering affection for previous seasons. Now we're left to wonder if the ceremony will happen and in what capacity ...
PONIEWOZIK See you in September! [Checks the headlines about the Hollywood labor negotiations.] Or much, much later!

Lola Tung was taking classes as a first-year acting student at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, when she heard the news. She had just been selected to play the lead in a new Amazon series called “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” based on the bestselling young adult novel by Jenny Han.
“I was just in shock because I didn’t expect this,” Tung, 20, a New York City native, said in a video interview last month. “I called my mom after and we were just crying together over the phone, which was lovely. But it was the best surprise ever.”
Tung, who was 18 years old and had acted only in school plays, took a leave of absence from college in 2021 to go to Wilmington, North Carolina, to join the production of the show, which tells a story of romantic awakening set at a beach house.
As summer commences and the show’s two central families head to the coast, Tung plays Isabel Conklin, known as Belly, an adolescent girl who becomes caught in a love triangle with two of her childhood best friends — who also happen to be brothers: Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno). The romantic tension captivated teen and young-adult viewers when the series debuted in 2022 and helped turn the show into a social media sensation. The hashtag #TheSummerITurnedPretty has accumulated millions of views on TikTok as users post fawning videos in support of “Team Conrad” or “Team Jere.”
“I knew it would be special, but I think nothing can ever prepare you,” Tung said. “There’s no way to know how it’s going to be received and how your life will change after.”
Tung continued her college leave to star in the show’s second season, which premieres on Prime Video on Friday. If watching the first season felt like basking in a perfect summer day — full of pool parties, passionate kisses and Kim Petras lyrics — the second season feels darker, cloudier, shrouded by loss.
Both Tung and her character have weathered a series of changes between the two seasons: Tung now has red-carpet interviews, a partnership with American Eagle and millions of Instagram followers; Belly has lost a close family friend and must fight to save the beach house. Both are learning what it means to grow up.
Ahead of the Season 2 debut, Tung spoke about her role, her favorite Taylor Swift music and whether she’s on Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: How do you get in the mindset of preparing to play the role of Belly?
A: Music plays such a big part in prepping for different scenes. We were jumping around a lot emotionally in Season 2, so I think music was a way to very quickly get into the head space of the character, whatever scene it was. I would journal a lot and write a lot, especially from Belly’s perspective. The first season, I wrote letters to each of the characters in Belly’s voice, which was really cool. I think when you journal and you write just sort of like stream of consciousness you learn a lot about the character.
Q: What were some of the songs you listened to for this season?
A: I listened to a lot of Mitski. “Two Slow Dancers” is a great song to listen to; it’s a very reflective sort of song. A lot of Taylor Swift. Phoebe Bridgers was on the playlist, Dodi was on the playlist, Lizzie McAlpine; I think I have some SZA on here as well. It was a lot of slightly more emotional songs — songs that felt nostalgic because Belly was really in this season dealing with a lot of changes in her life and dealing with the fact that change is inevitable. It’s a hard thing to realize growing up. You know, how do you move forward and still stay in touch with that magic of childhood and the familiarity and things that you know?
Q: What do you think this season says about the themes of change and loss and growth as a young person?
A: The characters have experienced a lot of growth and a lot of change since we last saw them. That’s a really hard thing for all of them to deal with, and they’re sort of on their own at the beginning. Season 1 was so much about these characters growing together and having each other to lean on. Season 2 is a lot about individual growth and how to take initiative, especially for Belly.
She’s really isolated from the boys and from her family, and feeling completely lost without Susannah (Rachel Blanchard) there. It was really cool to get to figure out what the next step was for her and how she moves forward from the weight of grief. It’s about learning that change is OK and normal. Even though things are different, everything will be OK.
Q: Are there aspects of Belly’s character you relate to? And are there aspects you feel are very dissimilar?
A: I definitely think we’re pretty similar, and I absolutely bring some of myself to her. It’s only natural if you’re playing a character, especially one so close in age. She’s a very emotional person and leads with her heart and cares a lot about the people in her life, especially her family, even if it’s hard to express that sometimes. I think she’s bolder than I am, and she’s more of a risk-taker, and that was something I thought would be a challenge. But I really enjoyed getting to tap into that part of her, and I learned from her in that way. I stole some of her boldness.
Q: I saw that Taylor Swift teased her “Back to December (Taylor’s Version)” song during the latest trailer for the show. Do you have a favorite song of hers you really resonate with?
A: I am a big fan of hers. I used to listen to her earlier albums like “Fearless” and “Speak Now” and “Red.” I had a little CD player and I would listen to them while I was falling asleep. I have a lot of favorite songs. I think an all-time favorite is “You Belong With Me” and then I also love “Everything Has Changed.” Right now I’m listening to “Mirrorball” a lot.
Q: What are the dynamics for you with the other actors both on set and off set?
A: I feel so lucky that we all get along so well and that I’ve made some really great friends. Especially in the first season, we played whiffle ball a bunch and we would just go grab dinner whenever we could. We would carpool together. When we had downtime on set, we would hang out and talk and play cards or chess. The guys loved playing chess on set, which I started to get into as well. It’s fun when you’re just sitting around waiting for the next setup in a scene to just play a quick game. I wasn’t that great, but I had fun.
Q: I have to ask — are you on Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah?
A: I always say I am the biggest supporter of Team Belly, forever and always, and I will always stick with that answer because I really do believe that she’s the only one who can make that choice. And if we’re doing our jobs right, I think you can see why she loves both of these boys. Ultimately it’s just about her following her heart.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Simon Mackenzie, a security officer at the discount retailer QD Stores outside London, was short of breath. He had just chased after three shoplifters who had taken off with several packages of laundry soap. Before the police arrived, he sat at a back-room desk to do something important: Capture the culprits' faces.
On an aging desktop computer, he pulled up security camera footage, pausing to zoom in and save a photo of each thief. He then logged in to a facial recognition program, Facewatch, which his store uses to identify shoplifters. The next time those people enter any shop within a few miles that uses Facewatch, store staff will receive an alert.
"It's like having somebody with you saying, 'That person you bagged last week just came back in,"' Mr. Mackenzie said.
Use of facial recognition technology by the police has been heavily scrutinized in recent years, but its application by private businesses has received less attention. Now, as the technology improves and its cost falls, the systems are reaching further into people's lives. No longer just the purview of government agencies, facial recognition is increasingly being deployed to identify shoplifters, problematic customers and legal adversaries.
Facewatch, a British company, is used by retailers across the country frustrated by petty crime. For as little as 250 pounds a month, or roughly $ 320, Facewatch offers access to a customized watchlist that stores near one another share. When Facewatch spots a flagged face, an alert is sent to a smartphone at the shop, where employees decide whether to keep a close eye on the person or ask the person to leave.
Mr. Mackenzie adds one or two new faces every week, he said, mainly people who steal diapers, groceries, pet supplies and other low-cost goods. He said their economic hardship made him sympathetic, but that the number of thefts had gotten so out of hand that facial recognition was needed. Usually at least once a day, Facewatch alerts him that somebody on the watchlist has entered the store.
Facial recognition technology is proliferating as Western countries grapple with advances brought on by artificial intelligence. The European Union is drafting rules that would ban many of facial recognition's uses, while Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, has encouraged retailers to try the technology to fight crime. MSG Entertainment, the owner of Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall, has used automated facial recognition to refuse entry to lawyers whose firms have sued the company.
Among democratic nations, Britain is at the forefront of using live facial recognition, with courts and regulators signing off on its use. The police in London and Cardiff are experimenting with the technology to identify wanted criminals as they walk down the street. In May, it was used to scan the crowds at the coronation of King Charles III.
But the use by retailers has drawn criticism as a disproportionate solution for minor crimes. Individuals have little way of knowing they are on the watchlist or how to appeal. In a legal complaint last year, Big Brother Watch, a civil society group, called it "Orwellian in the extreme."
Fraser Sampson, Britain's biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, who advises the government on policy, said there was "a nervousness and a hesitancy" around facial recognition technology because of privacy concerns and poorly performing algorithms in the past.
"But I think in terms of speed, scale, accuracy and cost, facial recognition technology can in some areas, you know, literally be a game changer," he said. "That means its arrival and deployment is probably inevitable. It's just a case of when."
'You can't expect the police to come'
Facewatch was founded in 2010 by Simon Gordon, the owner of a popular 19th-century wine bar in central London known for its cellarlike interior and popularity among pickpockets.
At the time, Mr. Gordon hired software developers to create an online tool to share security camera footage with the authorities, hoping it would save the police time filing incident reports and result in more arrests.
There was limited interest, but Mr. Gordon's fascination with security technology was piqued. He followed facial recognition developments and had the idea for a watchlist that retailers could share and contribute to. It was like the photos of shoplifters that stores keep next to the register, but supercharged into a collective database to identify bad guys in real time.
By 2018, Mr. Gordon felt the technology was ready for commercial use.
"You've got to help yourself," he said in an interview. "You can't expect the police to come."
Facewatch, which licenses facial recognition software made by Real Networks and Amazon, is now inside nearly 400 stores across Britain. Trained on millions of pictures and videos, the systems read the biometric information of a face as the person walks into a shop and check it against a database of flagged people.
Facewatch's watchlist is constantly growing as stores upload photos of shoplifters and problematic customers. Once added, a person remains there for a year before being deleted.
'Mistakes are rare but do happen'
Every time Facewatch's system identifies a shoplifter, a notification goes to a person who passed a test to be a "super recognizer" -- someone with a special talent for remembering faces. Within seconds, the super recognizer must confirm the match against the Facewatch database before an alert is sent.
But while the company has created policies to prevent misidentification and other errors, mistakes happen.
In October, a woman buying milk in a supermarket in Bristol, England, was confronted by an employee and ordered to leave. She was told that Facewatch had flagged her as a barred shoplifter.
The woman, who asked that her name be withheld because of privacy concerns and whose story was corroborated by materials provided by her lawyer and Facewatch, said there must have been a mistake. When she contacted Facewatch a few days later, the company apologized, saying it was a case of mistaken identity.
After the woman threatened legal action, Facewatch dug into its records. It found that the woman had been added to the watchlist because of an incident 10 months earlier involving £20 of merchandise, about $ 25. The system "worked perfectly," Facewatch said.
But while the technology had correctly identified the woman, it did not leave much room for human discretion. Neither Facewatch nor the store where the incident occurred contacted her to let her know that she was on the watchlist and to ask what had happened.
The woman said she did not recall the incident and had never shoplifted. She said she may have walked out after not realizing that her debit card payment failed to go through at a self-checkout kiosk.
Madeleine Stone, the legal and policy officer for Big Brother Watch, said Facewatch was "normalizing airport-style security checks for everyday activities like buying a pint of milk."
Mr. Gordon declined to comment on the incident in Bristol.
In general, he said, "mistakes are rare but do happen." He added, "If this occurs, we acknowledge our mistake, apologize, delete any relevant data to prevent reoccurrence and offer proportionate compensation."
Approved by the privacy office
Civil liberties groups have raised concerns about Facewatch and suggested that its deployment to prevent petty crime might be illegal under British privacy law, which requires that biometric technologies have a "substantial public interest."
The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office, the privacy regulator, conducted a yearlong investigation into Facewatch. The office concluded in March that Facewatch's system was permissible under the law, but only after the company made changes to how it operated.
Stephen Bonner, the office's deputy commissioner for regulatory supervision, said in an interview that an investigation had led Facewatch to change its policies: It would put more signage in stores, share among stores only information about serious and violent offenders and send out alerts only about repeat offenders. That means people will not be put on the watchlist after a single minor offense, as happened to the woman in Bristol.
"That reduces the amount of personal data that's held, reduces the chances of individuals being unfairly added to this kind of list and makes it more likely to be accurate," Mr. Bonner said. The technology, he said, is "not dissimilar to having just very good security guards."
Liam Ardern, the operations manager for Lawrence Hunt, which owns 23 Spar convenience stores that use Facewatch, estimates the technology has saved the company more than £50,000 since 2020.
He called the privacy risks of facial recognition overblown. The only example of misidentification that he recalled was when a man was confused for his identical twin, who had shoplifted. Critics overlook that stores like his operate on thin profit margins, he said.
"It's easy for them to say, 'No, it's against human rights,"' Mr. Ardern said. If shoplifting isn't reduced, he said, his shops will have to raise prices or cut staff.

From Dodger Stadium To Docks, L.A. Workers Are Flexing Union Muscle: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: California union members are pressuring employers over wages in one of the nation's most labor-friendly states.
In the two months since they went on strike, screenwriters have become a fixture outside studios in Southern California, signs aloft as the traffic roars past. In many parts of America, theirs would be a lonely vigil.
Not in Los Angeles.
At the behemoth ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, operations were disrupted for weeks until West Coast dockworkers reached a tentative contract deal in mid-June. Across the city, schools shut down for three days this spring when bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers walked out.
Now, the union representing some 15,000 hotel workers in Los Angeles is threatening to strike this Fourth of July weekend, just as the summer tourism season ramps up. And more than 160,000 actors are poised to shut down Hollywood productions if they cannot reach a new contract deal later this month.
Unions have been embattled nationally, but in California they are having a moment.
"We're calling it the 'hot labor summer,"' said Lorena Gonzalez, the chief officer of the California Labor Federation, which represents more than 2.1 million union members statewide. "We have sparks and fires everywhere, and we're not letting it die down in California. We're fanning the flames."
California has long been a labor stronghold, with Democrats in control of state government and most large cities. Despite a string of labor wins in recent years -- including a minimum wage of $ 15.50 an hour, more than double the federal rate -- workers say they are feeling ever more pressure from inflation, housing shortages and technological disruptions.
The unemployment rate remains below 5 percent in California, so workers know they have leverage. And numerous contracts are expiring this year, forcing California employers to negotiate with unions as they watch picket lines form daily in Los Angeles. Roughly half of the large work stoppages in 2023 have taken place in the state.
On Friday, a major contract for the hotel workers ran out, while the actors' union said that it would extend its expiring contract through July 12, buying more time to continue negotiations.
Hotel workers could walk out as soon as this weekend, however. Operators of hotels might be able to muddle through a short-term walkout, but a longer one could deter tourists from visiting Los Angeles in the busy summer months, and erode the convention business that has rebounded since the beginning of the pandemic, said Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist with the Milken Institute, an economic think tank based in Santa Monica, Calif.
Simultaneous strikes of hotel workers, screenwriters and actors would ripple first through Los Angeles businesses that rely on the region's signature tourism and Hollywood industries. And they could have a broader effect beyond Los Angeles; during the 2007 screenwriters strike, the California economy lost $ 2.1 billion, according to one estimate.
The Hotel Association of Los Angeles said in a statement that it had bargained in good faith and would continue to serve tourists during a walkout. Keith Grossman, a spokesman for the coordinated bargaining group consisting of more than 40 Los Angeles and Orange County hotels, said in a statement that it had offered to increase pay for housekeepers currently making $ 25 an hour in Beverly Hills and downtown Los Angeles to more than $ 31 per hour by January 2027.
"If there is a strike, it will occur because the union is determined to have one," Mr. Grossman said. "The hotels want to continue to provide strong wages, affordable quality family health care and a pension."
A recurring theme this year among striking workers has been the unbearable cost of living in Southern California. School employees said in March that they had to take two or three side gigs to afford their bills. Screenwriters have echoed that lament. A University of Southern California survey recently found that 60 percent of local tenants said they were "rent-burdened," spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing.
"How can anyone keep living here?" asked Lucero Ramirez, 37, who has worked as a housekeeper at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills since 2018.
On Thursday, Ms. Ramirez gathered inside an office space near downtown Los Angeles with dozens of other hotel workers represented by Unite Here Local 11 to decorate poster boards and staple together fliers ahead of a planned strike. Earlier that day, the Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites announced that it had staved off a walkout with a contract deal.
The union has asked that the hourly wage, now $ 20 to $ 25 for housekeepers, immediately increase by $ 5, followed by $ 3 bumps in each subsequent year of a three-year contract. Hotel workers -- and their employers -- are well aware that this deal will set pay levels ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics, when tourists will flood the region.
Ms. Ramirez, who earns $ 25 an hour, has lived in a rent-controlled, one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood for the past decade, where she pays $ 1,100 a month. The hot water often goes out, and the flooring in her unit is cracked and decaying, she said.
"The landlord wants me to leave so they can boost the rent," she said. "They want me out, but I cannot afford to go anywhere else, I would have to leave the city."
Labor power is a function of the electorate in California, where Democrats have nearly a 2-to-1 edge over Republicans, supermajority control of the state Legislature, a lock on state offices -- and owe a debt to unions, whose members routinely knock on doors and contribute money to liberal candidates.
Next year, voters in California will consider an initiative that would raise the minimum wage to $ 18 an hour. In Los Angeles, members of the City Council are weighing a plan that would raise the minimum wage for tourism workers to $ 25 an hour. Maria Elena Durazo, a Democratic state senator and former head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, is carrying legislation that would give all health care workers a $ 25 minimum hourly wage.
Tens of thousands of unionized teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other employees at the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest district, won major raises this year after their high-profile walkout in March.
Smaller labor actions have proliferated as well, including strippers organizing in May at a North Hollywood club, and Amazon drivers walking out in June at a warehouse in Palmdale, Calif. The Los Angeles Dodgers averted a strike by giving ushers, groundskeepers and other workers significant raises.
Across the country, union membership as a percentage of the labor force has dropped to a record low of 10.1 percent of employed wage and salary workers. In California, however, such membership rose last year to 16.1 percent of wage and salary workers, compared with 15.9 percent in 2021.
"This is a tug of war between inflation and wages," said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. "Inflation has been winning and workers are trying to catch up with inflation that's been persistent."
Nancy Hoffman Vanyek, the chief executive of the Greater San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 400 businesses from one-person operations to Hollywood studios, said that workers should be able to afford to live in Los Angeles. But she said simply forcing employers to pay more was a Band-Aid for a much deeper problem in California.
"It's business that always has to bear the brunt of fixing these issues, when we're not looking at what's causing them," she said. "What's causing the high cost of living in our state? What's causing the high cost of housing?"
Workers nationally are trying to lock in gains from a job market that has remained tight, as employers brace for a possible recession. Rail workers were on the brink of a strike last year, while employees at manufacturing companies like John Deere and Kellogg went on strike in late 2021.
In California, the activism has been further driven by white-collar workers, whose jobs have been threatened by the rise of artificial intelligence and the gig economy.
"It's remarkable, the degree to which they are getting support from other unions," said Nelson Lichtenstein, who directs the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "There's a new sense of commonality between the retail clerk who is being told to come in every other day from 3 to 7 p.m. and the screenwriter who is suddenly being offered seven episodes to write and then, goodbye."

The Rise and Uncertain Future Of a Downtown Institution: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Paper Magazine made its debut in June 1984. The first issue was a foldout poster with a look as minimalist as the publication's name, matching the raw aesthetic that reigned over Lower Manhattan in those days.
With its mix of bubbly enthusiasm and Gen-X skepticism, Paper became the scrappy kid sibling to the argumentative Village Voice and the lustrous Interview. Its readers were beautiful people and misfits, insiders and outsiders. Cover subjects included Sandra Bernhard, Naomi Campbell, Deee-lite, Kim Gordon, Cyndi Lauper, Queen Latifah, Chloë Sevigny, Venus Williams and Kim Kardashian.
The brains behind the operation were Kim Hastreiter and David Hershkovits, who had met while working at The SoHo Weekly News , an alternative paper that folded in 1982. On their watch Paper tracked all that was young, queer and cool in the culture until 2017, when it was acquired by EntTech Media Group.
In April, EntTech laid off the staff and sought a buyer. A few weeks ago, the media entrepreneur Brian Calle , who had resurrected The Village Voice and LA Weekly, said in an interview for this article that he had struck a deal to bring Paper back. In this oral history, the main players describe the highs and lows of a mostly glorious 40-year run.
Cyndi Lauper, musician: It was a very creative, inventive time. And there were no rules. You made it up as you went along. You invented yourself. That was such a great part of the '80s. It was so inspiring.
Kim Hastreiter, co-founder: SoHo was bubbling. We were right in the middle of it, and David wanted to start a weekly. We tried to raise money for two years, but everyone rejected us. So we ended up just having to do it ourselves.
David Hershkovits, co-founder: We were trying to figure out how we were going to start this thing. I received a poster in the mail for a Kenny Scharf art opening. I was lying in bed and I unfolded it and went, "This could be something that we can make into a magazine. Do it as a poster." It was visually stunning and different.
Carlo McCormick, writer, editor, 1984-2017: It started off a misshapen and unwieldy oddity in print. It celebrated a time of amateurism that's probably been lost in New York.
Kim Hastreiter: I sold ads to Danceteria, Patricia Field, the Fun Gallery, the Pyramid. The ads were like $ 250 each. I would personally have to get the ad and collect the money.
In the early years, Paper was a D.I.Y. operation run mostly out of Ms. Hastreiter's loft on Lispenard Street in TriBeCa. Richard Weigand, who was then a freelance designer at The New York Times, and Lucy Sisman, a designer and journalist who also worked at The Times, helped give the publication its distinctive look.
David Hershkovits: It was super hard because we didn't have the equipment. We would go to The Times and produce a lot of the magazine secretly.
Richard Weigand, art director, The New York Times: I said, "Well, since we're in the building, you might as well come and do it here." I was stuck there all day anyway.
Todd Eberle, photographer: It was just X-acto blades and this thing called a waxing machine. They would have column lines drawn out, and you would literally paste a piece of text onto that column. And then there would be a freak out, because they noticed a comma was missing. I remember searching around on the floor, trying to find a waxy comma.
Kim Hastreiter: You didn't sleep. We were so exhausted. Onetime David had the matte knife and he said, "Has anybody seen a reverse apostrophe?"
Richard Pandiscio, then the art director of Condé Nast's House & Garden, came aboard as the lead designer, working on Paper in his off hours. Soon, ad revenue allowed it to morph from a broadsheet into a perfect-bound magazine.
Kim Hastreiter: My parents lived on 12th Street, near Fairchild Publications. My father called me, hysterical: "They're throwing away all the desks! I have them for you!" He had all these giant steel desks from the 1940s that weighed a million pounds. But we had to take them because they were free. And that put me over the edge because I had 10 gigantic desks in my house. So we got an office.
Debi Mazar, actress: Kim was on the pulse of everything. I was doing a lot of photo shoots for her, and we just became girlfriends -- not lovers, but girlfriends. I was 16 and I was working at the Mudd Club. Kenny Scharf, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat were my friends. No one was famous yet.
Anna Sui, fashion designer: Kim had this column about things she was obsessed with. It made your month, if you were on that list, because everybody was reading Paper.
Kenny Scharf, artist: Of course, we were aware of Paper. Basically, it was the East Village Eye and Paper, and then some magazines in Japan like Brutus, that were writing about us.
Cyndi Lauper: It wasn't like other magazines. It really documented the downtown scene.
Sally Singer, head of fashion direction, Amazon: I was a teenager in California and I would seek it out on specialized newsstands. It was a dispatch from a cool world that I didn't live in.
John Waters, filmmaker: I had a subscription from the day I saw it.
Todd Eberle, photographer: There was downtown and there was uptown. One never went uptown -- maybe to the Met. And Paper was the first to kind of start mixing that up. It was a really interesting creative friction that caused sparks.
In 1989, to celebrate its fifth anniversary, the B-52's posed for the cover. Still, it was more succès d'estime than moneymaker.
Kim Hastreiter: I worked for no salary for, like, eight years. I had to have other jobs.
Maggie McCormick: Sometimes bill collectors would come. We had to hide Kim under the blankets on her bed.
Debi Mazar: I did hair and makeup, and I was good at it. I did a lot of work for Paper. I don't think I got paid.
Todd Eberle: They didn't pay photographers. It was all for the glory of being published, which was a big deal then.
Richard Pandiscio, art director, 1985-1990: They gave me a lot of I.O.U.'s, which was cute.
While keeping an eye out for whatever was new in the culture, Paper included politics in the mix, mainly because the AIDS epidemic was ravaging the world the magazine covered. Joe Dolce covered the AIDS crisis; the graffiti artist Futura wrote about video games; and George Wayne documented nightlife.
David Hershkovits: Reagan wouldn't even say the word AIDS in 1984. And while this whole uproar was going on, Tina Brown put Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan on the cover of Vanity Fair, dancing, as if there was nothing wrong. We took a stand. It wasn't that popular in those days.
Bethann Hardison, activist, former model: They didn't try to be diverse, because they naturally were.
Maggie McCormick, office manager, 1985-1993: There were just so many moments at Paper when you knew the world was being changed. I saw one of LL Cool J's first performances.
Fenton Bailey, producer, former Paper columnist: The vibe was, "Hip-hop is a fad. It'll come and go." And that was not the attitude of Paper.
Dennis Dermody, film critic, 1986-2017: I got a call from David Hershkovits. He said, "Listen, we need a film critic, and I hear you go to the movies all the time. We don't pay." And I said, "Well, that sweetens the pot." But who else would let me put out an article called "How to Cook and Eat Macaulay Culkin"?
Christine Muhlke, managing editor, 1994-2000: I got to ask bell hooks if she'd write a column for us. I said, "I can only pay you $ 100 a month but I promise I won't change a word." She said, "Sweetie, that is the nicest, sweetest thing I've ever heard in my life. Yes!"
Eileen Myles, poet, activist: I had just run for president, so I had this excessive idea of who I was, and I didn't know where to go next, and those guys offered me this opportunity to be in their web. I wrote whatever the hell I was thinking about -- millennial cults, labor movements, being queer living in the country. They were wide open.
Dennis Dermody: We were doing an April Fool's issue in 1995, the year Disney was putting out "Pocahontas." So I wrote this jokey article about how I saw a screening of it and it was depraved, filthy, and was going to get an NC-17 rating. La Stampa, in Rome, put up a big article: "Scandal Rocks Disney!" Disney held a press conference to say it was just a joke. David called me and said, "You've got to get down here, because your article is an international incident." I couldn't stop laughing.
Paper's interns included people who went on to success in their fields -- the costume designer Sophie de Rakoff, the musician Jake Shears and the New York Magazine deputy editor Alexis Swerdloff.
Kim Hastreiter: If you found someone smart, you dumped everything on them. "Want to write a cover story?" And they'd be in high school.
Susanna Howe, assistant, editor, photographer, 1994-1996: Paper was like magazine grad school, because you were allowed to do so much that you would never be allowed to do at a bigger magazine. When I finally left, to go to Condé Nast, I quickly learned what big-boy magazine culture was: Being treated really badly. They wanted me to pick up their dry cleaning.
Mickey Boardman, intern, office manager, editorial director, 1992-2017: I applied to be an intern in March of 1992. I basically got kicked out of school. I didn't really like Parsons and they didn't really care for me, either. But Paper loved me and they loved my crazy outfits. I was a crystal meth addict at the time. I would wear Lilly Pulitzer pants with a lady's polyester blouse and a chandelier necklace.
Christine Muhlke: Mickey was interviewing this woman for the receptionist job, and a mouse got caught in a trap, and he was killing it with his bare hands while he was interviewing her.
Susanna Howe: I remember that so well. He thought it was OK to take two sticky traps and sandwich the mouse between them and then throw that into the garbage. And you could still hear it squeaking. And he just went back to his desk.
Vikki Tobak, intern, columnist, 1992-1997: Carlo McCormick, one of our editors, had just gotten arrested and put in a Mexican prison. It was like, "We're not working today. We're just focused on getting Carlo out of prison." That was my first week.
Carlo McCormick: I was indeed incarcerated in Mexico, sentenced to 25 years federal time for trafficking in peyote, which, of course, I was not. I was there doing a story on the art of a tribe that used peyote for their sacred visions.
To raise funds for Mr. McCormick's legal defense, Paper put on a show at Irving Plaza. Karen Finley, Richard Hell, the Psychedelic Furs and Deee-lite were on the bill. (Mr. McCormick was later exonerated in a Mexican court.) As the '90s moved along, Paper started featuring mainstream celebrities on its covers. When the magazine wasn't covering parties, it was hosting them.
David Hershkovits: The '90s were the most lucrative time for us. There were lots of ads. New York was exploding.
Vikki Tobak: Paper had a lot of power. Walking up to a door, I'd just say, "I'm Vicki from Paper," and the seas would part.
Hunter Hill, publisher, 1993-2013: We didn't have Condé Nast expense accounts. What we did have was a lot of cool people. Certain companies understood that and embraced it: Calvin Klein, Levi's, Adidas.
Pedro Almodóvar, filmmaker: Kim has the best nose to smell emerging talent. When I released "All About My Mother," she introduced me to two adorable beings, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal. They were very trendy in the city.
Anna Sui: Somebody would call and say, "Oh, Paper's having this party on the Manhattan Bridge." There were hundreds of people, and I remember how exciting it was, just seeing the subway cars go by. It lasted 20 minutes before the police came. You felt like it was something special and renegade.
The media industry fell on hard times in the 21st century, destabilized by the internet. Like other publications Paper looked beyond its core business. It sponsored a concert series, Sounds of Paper. There were also Paper pop-up shops, an art store at Art Basel Miami and brand partnerships.
Alexis Swerdloff, intern, associate editor, executive editor, 2005-2012: It became a little more professionalized at some point. If you had a musician who had an album coming out, it was useful to have their first piece in Paper. I kept a Lady Gaga album on my desk with a Post-it note from a colleague, saying, "You should go check her out." And I was like, "Pass." Oops.
Carlo McCormick: The big blow was 9/11. Advertising budgets just dried up.
Kim Hastreiter: The designer Stephen Sprouse called me and said, "Target asked me to do something." I was like, "What?" This is like in 2002. No one was doing collaborations. I called up all these talented people and said, "Can you design something for under $ 15 for Target?" Manolo Blahnik did a shoehorn, Isaac Mizrahi designed a mothball that's a cube, so it didn't roll, and I ran it at 30 pages with the title "Hey, Target: How About This?" I got a call from Target's chief marketing officer, Michael Francis. He said, "This is the best thing." He took me to the Odeon and hired me. I said, "You have to pay Paper." So I worked for Target until the day I left.
Michael Francis, former chief marketing officer, Target: Kim helped us identify the right partners to engage. Frankly, we were borrowing the equity that they created with Paper. It was cutting-edge.
Carlo McCormick: I used to look down on other publications: "These magazines are way too much about marketing!" Well, Paper eventually became that, as well. It was a little sad and a little embarrassing to me, but I wasn't the one trying to keep the lights on. So, no judgment.
Paper created its own marketing agency, Extra Extra. And it adapted to the internet, scoring an online hit in 2014 with a Jean-Paul Goude photo shoot featuring Kim Kardashian. In one picture, she is seen balancing a Champagne glass on her derrière. At a time when Paper's print circulation stood at 155,000, the feature racked up 16 million web views in two days. It also got the attention of the media executive Tom Florio, who had served as the publisher of Vogue during his two-decade tenure at Condé Nast.
John Cafarelli, chief operating officer, 2012-2018: The magazine was still a beachhead of the brand. But in terms of how we made money? We sold access and ideas to some of the biggest companies in the world: Target, American Express, Tiffany & Company.
David Hershkovits: It became a different business because of the internet. And I felt outside the content of the magazine as time went on. I saw the writing on the wall.
Tom Florio, chief executive officer, EntTech: The Kim Kardashian cover shoot cost $ 10,000. And it took 30 million people to Papermag.com. An Annie Leibovitz shoot at Vogue cost significantly more and only drove 750,000 views to their website.
EntTech bought Paper in 2017. As its identity continued to evolve, the coronavirus pandemic cut into its events business. In June, about a month after EntTech laid off the staff, Paper was sold to Mr. Calle.
Brian Calle: I'm passionate about figuring out ways to create a new model for these legacy institutions, but then also preserve the work itself. I think Paper is perfectly positioned to be the go-to avant-garde agency.
David Hershkovits: Good luck to them. It's not why we started it. We got our agency thing going so we could put out the magazine. The magazine was always primary.
Kim Hastreiter: I had my knee replaced. The doctor asked me a million health questions. And then, his last thing, he says: "I just want to say thank you. Paper saved my life. I was a young gay, growing up in Indiana, and I found Paper and it made me realize I wasn't alone."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Brazil's electoral court banned former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking office until 2030 for spreading false claims about the nation's voting system.
Brazilian election officials on Friday blocked former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking public office until 2030, removing a top contender from the next presidential contest and dealing a significant blow to the country's far-right movement.
Brazil's electoral court ruled that Mr. Bolsonaro had violated Brazil's election laws when, less than three months ahead of last year's vote, he called diplomats to the presidential palace and made baseless claims that the nation's voting systems were likely to be rigged against him.
Five of the court's seven judges voted that Mr. Bolsonaro had abused his power as president when he convened the meeting with diplomats and broadcast it on state television.
"This response will confirm our faith in the democracy," said Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who leads the electoral court, as he cast his vote against Mr. Bolsonaro.
The decision is a sharp and swift rebuke of Mr. Bolsonaro and his effort to undermine Brazil's elections. Just six months ago, Mr. Bolsonaro was president of one of the world's largest democracies. Now his career as a politician is in jeopardy.
Under the ruling, Mr. Bolsonaro, 68, will next be able to run for president in 2030, when he is 75. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2026.
Mr. Bolsonaro said Friday that he was not surprised by the 5-to-2 decision because the court had always been against him. "Come on. We know that since I took office they said I was going to carry out a coup," he told reporters (though he, too, had hinted at that possibility). "This is not democracy."
His lawyers had argued that his speech to diplomats was an "act of government" aimed at raising legitimate concerns about election security.
Mr. Bolsonaro appeared to accept his fate, saying Friday that he would focus on campaigning for other right-wing candidates.
Yet he is still expected to appeal the ruling to Brazil's Supreme Court, though that body acted aggressively to rein in his power during his presidency. He has harshly attacked the high court for years, calling some justices "terrorists" and accusing them of trying to sway the vote against him.
Even if an appeal is successful, Mr. Bolsonaro would face another 15 cases in the electoral court, including accusations that he improperly used public funds to influence the vote and that his campaign ran a coordinated misinformation campaign. Any of those cases could also block him from seeking the presidency.
He is also linked to several criminal investigations, involving whether he provoked his supporters to storm Brazil's halls of power on Jan. 8 and whether he was involved in a scheme to falsify his vaccine records. (Mr. Bolsonaro has declined the Covid-19 vaccine.) A conviction in any criminal case would also render him ineligible for office, in addition to carrying possible prison time.
Mr. Bolsonaro was a shock to Brazil's politics when he was elected president in 2018. A former Army captain and fringe far-right congressman, he rode a populist wave to the presidency on an anti-corruption campaign.
His lone term was marked by controversy from the start, including a sharp rise in deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, a hands-off approach to the pandemic that left nearly 700,000 dead in Brazil and harsh attacks against the press, the judiciary and the left.
But it was his repeated broadsides against Brazil's voting systems that alarmed many Brazilians, as well as the international community, stoking worries that he might try to hold on to power if he lost last October's election.
Mr. Bolsonaro did lose by a slim margin and at first refused to concede. Under pressure from allies and rivals, he eventually agreed to a transition to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Yet, after listening to Mr. Bolsonaro's false claims for years, many Bolsonaro supporters remained convinced that Mr. Lula, a leftist, had stolen the election. On Jan. 8, a week after Mr. Lula took office, thousands of people stormed Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, hoping to induce the military to take over the government and restore Mr. Bolsonaro as president.
Mr. Bolsonaro said on Friday that the riot was not an attempted coup, but instead "little old women and little old men, with Brazilian flags on their back and Bibles under their arms."
Since then, more evidence has emerged that at least some members of Mr. Bolsonaro's inner circle were entertaining ideas of a coup. Brazil's federal police found separate drafts of plans for Mr. Bolsonaro to hold on to power at the home of Mr. Bolsonaro's justice minister and on the phone of his former assistant.
Mr. Bolsonaro's attacks on the voting system and the Jan. 8 riot in Brazil bore a striking resemblance to former president Donald J. Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.
Yet the result for the two former presidents has so far been different. While Mr. Bolsonaro has already been excluded from the next presidential race, Mr. Trump remains the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump could also still run for president even if he is convicted of any of the various criminal charges he faces.
The ruling against Mr. Bolsonaro upends politics in Latin America's largest nation. For years, he has pulled Brazil's conservative movement further to the right with harsh rhetoric against rivals, skepticism of science, a love of guns and an embrace of the culture wars.
He received 49.1 percent of the vote in the 2022 election, just 2.1 million votes behind Mr. Lula, in the nation's closest presidential contest since it returned to democracy in 1985, following a military dictatorship.
Yet conservative leaders in Brazil, with an eye toward Mr. Bolsonaro's legal challenges, have started to move on, touting Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, the right-wing governor of Brazil's largest state, São Paulo, as the new standard-bearer of the right and a 2026 challenger to Mr. Lula.
"He is a much more palatable candidate because he doesn't have Bolsonaro's liabilities and because he is making a move to the center," said Marta Arretche, a political science professor at the University of São Paulo.
The Brazilian press and pollsters have speculated that Mr. Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, or two of his sons would run for president. Mr. Bolsonaro said recently that he told Ms. Bolsonaro she doesn't have the necessary experience, "but she is an excellent campaigner."
Friday's decision is also further proof that Mr. Moraes, the head of the electoral court, has become one of Brazil's most powerful men.
During Mr. Bolsonaro's administration, Mr. Moraes acted as the most effective check on the president's power, leading investigations into Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies, jailing some of his supporters for what he viewed as threats against Brazil's institutions and ordering tech companies to remove the accounts of many other right-wing voices.
Those tactics raised concerns that he was abusing his power, and Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters have called Mr. Moraes an authoritarian. On the left, he has been praised as the savior of Brazil's democracy.
Mr. Bolsonaro's case before the electoral court stemmed from a 47-minute meeting on July 18 in which he called dozens of foreign diplomats to the presidential residence to present what he promised was evidence of fraud in past Brazilian elections.
He made unfounded claims that Brazil's voting machines changed ballots for him to other candidates in a previous election and that a 2018 hack of the electoral court's computer network showed the vote could be rigged. But security experts have said the hackers could never gain access to the voting machines or change votes.
The speech was broadcast on the Brazilian government's television network and its social media channels. Some tech companies later took the video down because it spread election misinformation.
As for Mr. Bolsonaro's future plans? He told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo that during the three months he spent in Florida this year after his election loss, he was offered a job as a "poster boy" for American businesses wanting to reach Brazilians.
"I went to a hamburger joint and it filled with people," he said. "But I don't want to abandon my country."

Full text: The need for data centers has soared, fueled by remote work and the growth of high-speed streaming. But finding the necessary land and energy can be a challenge.
Past the dense western suburbs of Washington, the vistas widen into open stretches of fields and farmland -- a panorama frequently interrupted by massive, windowless buildings housing the high-speed computers that make technologies like 5G and artificial intelligence possible.
These data centers are beginning to dot landscapes across the nation, from Virginia to Oregon. Each has hundreds of servers and routers that send and receive data for everyday tasks like streaming content on mobile devices and handling high-speed financial trades.
"It is the engine that powers the machine," said Gordon Dolven, director of data center research in the Americas for CBRE, a commercial real estate services firm. "Everything on your phone is stored somewhere within four walls."
In the past few years, the need for data centers has rapidly increased, fueled by changing work habits during the pandemic and the growth of cloud-based technologies. That means more buildings, more land, more cooling systems and more electricity to support the physical infrastructure that runs 24/7.
Technological advances will only increase demand for data centers, said Noelle Walsh, corporate vice president for cloud innovation and operations at Microsoft. "As a society, we are just getting started," she added.
But finding enough land to build a data center and sufficient electricity to run it can be a challenge. And developers must address community concerns about these behemoth buildings, which are popping up next to housing developments and straining local electricity providers that have struggled to keep up with the demand.
Northern Virginia is a major hub for data centers, partly because of its proximity to major pieces of physical infrastructure that form the foundation of the internet. Amazon announced plans this year to build multiple data centers in Virginia by 2040, an estimated $ 35 billion investment.
On the West Coast, a similar hub lies near Silicon Valley. A majority of the world's internet traffic flows through the sites in these two regions, which function as crucial internet conveyor belts.
Industry analysts say there is growing need to build data centers throughout the rest of the country, part of an effort to bring them closer to customers and take advantage of increasing availability of high-speed networks in rural areas and smaller cities.
The United States had 2,701 data centers in 2022, the largest number in the world, followed by Germany, a distant second, and Britain and China, according to data compiled by Statista. In addition to its two coastal hubs, U.S. data centers are concentrated near major cities, from Atlanta to Seattle.
Large digital companies and the federal government often own and operate their own data centers‌. Other businesses and governments frequently lease space.
"Anyone who can move into somebody else's data center will do that," said Jim Coakley, who develops, owns and manages high-security, high-density data centers. He built his first in Northern Virginia nearly 20 years ago.
Loudoun County, Va., is a key location for data centers, but nearby Prince William County is also experiencing a boom. Elected officials there recently approved a major zoning change for 2,100 acres, paving the way for about 25 million square feet of new data centers.
The zoning decision is not without controversy. Known as the Digital Gateway, the land is close to Manassas National Battlefield Park, whose superintendent has expressed concerns about "potential irreparable harm" to the site. Ann Wheeler, chairman of the board of supervisors in Prince William and a strong backer of the zoning change, lost her re-election bid in the Democratic primary last week after a grass-roots campaign to oust her emphasized her support for more data centers.
Data centers will increasingly be built farther from some of the traditional locations and will move closer to the clients they serve, according to research by Gartner, an I.T. consultancy. But the search for land is not always easy.
"Trying to find qualified land sites that have sufficient power to stand up these facilities -- you need 10 times what I built in 2006," Mr. Coakley said. "They are essentially inhaling massive amounts of energy."
The demand for data centers is so great that as soon as one is on the drawing board, the space is quickly scooped up, even before it goes to market.
"Every building that gets built gets leased," said Ryan Goeller, a commercial real estate broker and principal at KLNB, who specializes in Northern Virginia. "There is no vacancy."
Still, energy demands are complicating growth in some parts of the country. Dominion Energy, Virginia's principal electric utility used by data centers, has said it is struggling to provide enough power. Some residents fear the needs of data centers in the area, such as the construction of new power lines and substations, could fall to residents to subsidize. Silicon Valley is facing similar challenges, according to a February report by CBRE.
To lessen the demand for energy, the industry is trying to find greater efficiencies, said Arman Shehabi, a staff scientist in the Energy Technologies Area at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
"There has been a lot of growth, but a lot of opportunities for efficiency and incentives for efficiency," he said. And as major players in the data industry strive to become greener in the next decade, the pressure is on.
The growth of artificial intelligence "will require new kinds of efficiency," Dr. Shehabi said. "Right now it uses a lot of electricity, but it's not clear if that will continue to be true."
Electrical needs and availability of skilled electricians drove many decisions in 2022 on where to locate data centers, according to CBRE.
Other environmental concerns also loom. Backup systems for data centers often rely on natural gas and diesel, which can counter efforts toward clean energy. Water needs are also expanding, Dr. Shehabi said.
"We have to be strategic in terms of where we place data centers and consider the water stress level of the area when designing them," he said.
And developers face resistance from neighbors. Alex Holt, a recently retired first-grade teacher who lives in Gainesville, Va., was surprised when a large wall that marked the beginning of a data center appeared one morning, just a few yards from her townhouse development. A developer had promised to build a town center. "Years went by, and there was nothing there."
The community was eventually notified that the town center plan was to be replaced by a data center, but Ms. Holt said she did not understand the magnitude of the project at the time. And then, this year, "I looked out my front door and to the left there is this huge wall, and that is when I am like, 'Oh my gosh, this is unbelievable," she said.
But others see an upside to the data centers. They have provided substantial business for the construction industry and, in particular, for electricians.
The jobs pay about $ 75 an hour and offer a pension plan that, in many industries, is a relic of the past, said Joe Dabbs, a business manager for International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 26, which represents workers in Washington, D.C., Maryland and much of Virginia. Half the work on data centers, he estimated, is done by electricians.
"We are working seven days a week with multiple shifts," he said.

Perks Rise As Offices Push R.T.O.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The next stage of getting workers back at their desks includes incentives like $ 10 to the charity of their choice -- and consequences like poor performance evaluations if they don't make the trek in.
Manny Medina, the chief executive of a Seattle-based artificial intelligence sales company, doesn't mind repeating himself. It comes with the territory, after all. That tolerance proved convenient this year as he faced the same question innumerable times.
Wait, so why was it you wanted us back in the office?
The engineers reminded him of their commutes. The working parents reminded him of school pickup times. Mr. Medina replied with arguments he has delineated so often that they have come to feel like personal mantras: Being near each other makes the work better. Mr. Medina approached three years of mushy remote-plus-office work as an experiment. His takeaway was that ideas bubble up more organically in the clamor of the office.
"You can interrupt each other without being rude when you're in person," said Mr. Medina, whose company, Outreach, is now in the office on a hybrid basis. "In a Zoom conversation, you have to let somebody finish their thought."
For tens of millions of office workers, it's been three years of scattershot plans for returning to in-person work -- summoning people in, not really meaning it, everybody pretty much working wherever they pleased. Now, for the umpteenth time, businesses are ready to get serious.
A wave of companies called workers back to the office this spring and summer: Disney said four days a week, Amazon swung with three (prompting a walkout from corporate workers), Meta and Lyft are aiming for September deadlines for many of their employees. Others devised new tactics to ensure their return-to-office policies stuck. Google, which has asked most workers to be in the office three days a week, announced that performance reviews could take into account lengthy unexplained absences from the office, and badge records could be reviewed to identify those consistent absences, said Ryan Lamont, a company spokesman.
Google employees will be granted the ability to work remotely only on an extremely rare basis. "We want to see Googlers connecting and collaborating in person, so we're limiting remote work to exception only," Mr. Lamont said.
These new policies come as business leaders accept that hybrid work is a permanent reality, with just over a quarter of full workdays in the country now done at home, and offices still at half their prepandemic occupancy. (Though that 50 percent occupancy metric combines Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when offices are bustling, with Fridays, when they tend to be ghost towns.)
Salesforce, the business software behemoth, announced that for a 10-day period, it will give a $ 10 charitable donation per day on behalf of any employee who comes into the office (or for remote employees who attend company events). A spokeswoman said it was only natural the company would want to find moments for "doing well and doing good." But to some employees, it might feel like a tonal shift, given that the company's previous workplace plans were announced with fanfare for a future in which much of its staff could be fully or partially remote forever. (The company emphasized that this remains the case.)
"An immersive workspace is no longer limited to a desk in our Towers," the company wrote in a February 2021 memo. "The 9-to-5 workday is dead."
It was very much alive on a recent Monday at Salesforce Tower in New York, as a hum of activity filled the 41-story building looming over Bryant Park. Desks and conference rooms were filled with employees, some of them visiting from San Francisco for the company's A.I.-focused day. In the top-floor lounge, workers stood in line waiting for coffee, as Salesforce's catering team prepared shrimp tacos for an office event that week.
Scattered throughout the office were the company's animal mascots. Brandy the fox represents marketing. Astro the astronaut sat behind a piano in the 41st floor lounge. Codey the bear stood guard near the developers.
"It's the impromptu-ness of in-person -- so for example, I was at the office and there was somebody from Chicago, she was in the San Francisco office -- 'Oh do you have time to go and chat and have a meeting about a strategy that we're rolling out?"' said Nathalie Scardino, Salesforce's global head of talent strategy. "Inevitably, as a high-tech company, you have to keep changing to meet the needs of the business, of the customer."
It's not often that the entire white-collar business world gets thrown into an impromptu experiment -- executives left to discern how to make multimillion-dollar decisions in between bursts of "you're on mute," employees figuring out how to forge friendships and nudge mentors for advice while sitting next to piles of their laundry.
And for the last three years, some office decision-making has come to feel like parents scrambling to impose rules on an unruly home: "Do this." "Why?" "Because I said so." But now some business leaders say that the results of their remote work experiment are in. They feel emphatically that they need some in-person time. After months of layoffs, especially in tech, their next business moves feel particularly consequential.
"When the economy was warm, executives thought, 'I'd really like to have people back but it's OK because I have this margin of error,"' said Mark Ein, chairman of Kastle, the security firm whose "back to work barometer" made it a pandemic celebrity. "Now that things are tougher, they want to hunker down and have their people in the office."
DocuSign, which has more than 6,500 employees spread across the globe, became a poster child for the lurching back-and-forth over return-to-office planning. The company had hoped to call employees back in May 2020, then August 2020, then October 2021, then January 2022. Then the plans disintegrated altogether.
But this month, much of the company finally came back to the office. Since February, executives have evaluated every role at the company and decided roughly 70 percent were hybrid, meaning people would be partly in the office and partly remote, 30 percent were fully remote and under 1 percent were fully in the office. Jennifer Christie, the company's new chief people officer, absorbed dozens of questions from concerned employees.
"This can be a very polarizing subject," she said, adding that she views this summer as a period of experimentation in which she and other company leaders will evaluate what parts of their hybrid plan need changing. "We're running water through pipes that haven't had water run through them in a long time. So where are there going to be leaks?"
But Docusign's leaders were ready, she added, to stop talking about how to get people back in the office and start making their plans real. "We could debate it forever, we could speculate about what's going to happen forever, but the best way for us to understand how this will impact our culture and productivity and collaboration is to just start doing it."
It's been a long period of choose-your-own-adventure style workplace planning, and the shift companies have made toward firmer deadlines has taken some recruiters by surprise. Jasmine Silver, who runs a recruitment firm specializing in mothers hoping to re-enter the work force, found that in the last few months, many of her clients transitioned abruptly from fully remote to either hybrid or entirely in-office work. The transition was jarring for some workers, especially those who had moved far from their offices, or had become attached to new work-from-home habits.
And it's healthy for people to be able to express those frustrations, psychologists said.
"What appears to be a grumbling or complaint is in many cases a request for understanding," said Tracy Maylett, an organizational psychologist. "When you look at change, the most dangerous people are people who are quiet, because you don't know what they're thinking. You can't address their concerns."
The period of hand-wringing also tends to be temporary, judging by those companies now settled in their hybrid routines. Asana, for example, the productivity software firm, asked employees to come in at least on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays starting in 2022.
For months, return to office, or R.T.O., was a big topic of office conversation. Everybody had questions, and they were all directed toward Anna Binder, the head of human resources.
"Before we R.T.O.'d -- I love that that's now in the Webster Dictionary -- it was a topic of conversation because R.T.O. was theoretical, and being on the other side of the pandemic was theoretical," Ms. Binder said. "Most people came, returned and are here. Some people tried it, decided, 'It's not for me,' and they left."
Now, Ms. Binder continued, the issue doesn't really come up. Return to office isn't a hypothetical scenario. It's their reality. And they have so much else to talk about.
"Somebody on my team just recently fell in love with somebody, and she came in one day and it was like, 'What is going on with you?"' Ms. Binder said. "She got so red and she was like, 'My whole life has changed.' To share that moment with another human being -- it was really emotional."

Glam and Goop at a Gwyneth Paltrow Drag Show: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gwyneth Paltrow has been popping up in unexpected places this year. She was in court in March, dressed impeccably, and won $ 1 after being found not at fault for a ski crash. She was on a cruise ship. And on Friday evening at 3 Dollar Bill, a queer club in the East Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, she was onstage.
Well, not in the flesh, but her persona was present as a handful of drag queens put on their best performances in honor of Ms. Paltrow, the actress and founder of the lifestyle brand Goop. They recreated her roles including from the 2003 film "Sylvia," in which she starred as the poet; the television show "Glee," in which she played a substitute teacher; and the 1995 movie "Seven," in which she was the decapitated wife of a detective played by Brad Pitt.
Thorgy Thor, a drag performer who rose to fame on "Ru Paul's Drag Race" and served as host for the evening, riled up the crowd by reading some of Ms. Paltrow's more infamous quotes, like the time in 2011 when she said she would "rather smoke crack than eat cheese from a can." The crowd cheered. Scenes from Ms. Paltrow's oeuvre played on a loop on screens throughout the bar and performance space.
The event was billed as a Goop-themed rave, and attendees were encouraged to dress in costume. Imitation, as the saying goes, being the sincerest form of you know what. Goop was "flattered to be part of the inspiration for the evening," Noora Raj Brown, the company's executive vice president of brand, wrote in an email when asked about the event. Ms. Paltrow was unavailable for comment, she added.
In between performances, partygoers and performers discussed their outfits, their favorite (and least favorite) of Ms. Paltrow's performances and, of course, her company's most infamous wares.
Rachel Lu
Lives in: the Upper East Side of Manhattan
Who are you wearing tonight? I am wearing Ralph Lauren. "Ralph Lauren" in quotes, obviously. This is Gwyneth's Oscar-winning dress. It caused a huge controversy in the moment that she wore it. Everyone was like, "I can't believe you're wearing this pink thing." I love that it has its own Wikipedia page.
It does? It does, it does. Highly controversial.
Do you think Gwyneth Paltrow should have won that Oscar for "Shakespeare in Love"? Also highly controversial. No comment.
Cristina Miserendino
Lives in: West Harlem, Manhattan
What inspired your costume? I did "The Royal Tenenbaums." I like to cosplay so it was easy to be like, "Yo, let me get some things together."
Did you own all of this already? Oh, God, no. I made this wooden finger prop out of meltable plastic. I molded it around my finger. I bought a fur coat vintage online. Faux fur.
Are you frequently melting down plastic to make strange objects? Yes, I did it with antlers last week for a "Yellowjackets" cosplay.
Thorgy Thor
Lives in: Greenpoint, Brooklyn
You're hosting the show tonight. What are your thoughts on the woman of the evening? She's a cultural icon. As we were preparing for the show, you go to Google and there is not a photo of Gwyneth Paltrow where she is not smiling from ear to ear. I'm like, "You're kind of gorgeous and amazing but also ridiculous."
Thee Suburbia
Lives in: Astoria, Queens
What are you wearing? I'm wearing a replica of Versace that Gwyneth wore in "Duets" when she sang "Bette Davis Eyes" for a karaoke competition.
Cait Ryan
Lives in: Williamsburg, Brooklyn
What brought you out tonight? I love drag and it's Pride month. I love Pearl and Willow and Thorgy Thor. "Drag Race" and those specific queens got me through a really interesting time in my life. The good and the bad, I was living abroad, and I got into "Drag Race." I just love seeing people express themselves.
Your outfit is kind of giving sentient disco ball. How would you describe it? I am dressed up as Gwyneth from "Glee" from that one part where she's singing with Lea Michele and it's a disco theme.
Lars Burnham
Lives in: the West Village of Manhattan
Look at those eyes! Tell me about your makeup. We went for gooped. I was like, "What about slime? We love slime."
We do love slime. I love how precisely you applied it. It's like if Nickelodeon's "Slimed" happened in a very curated way.
Chris Tuttle
Lives in: Chicago
What are you doing in town: I'm here assisting Willow Pill. Tonight I am helping her with her costume changes and I'm lighting a sparkler on her crotch onstage.
Describe your outfit: It's just a little blazer, a little thong and a pair of thigh highs.
Julia Starr
Lives in: Minneapolis, Minn.
You go onstage very soon! Tell me about this costume you're constructing. A lot of labor and love and a lot of makeup. I'm doing "Seven," so my girl's going to be a severed head onstage. It's going to be living. It's going to be life. It's going to be everything.
There's somebody in the crowd who dressed as "Seven" with a box on her head, too. Shut up, I've got to make this right now. I couldn't fit anything in my luggage so I asked my friend. I was like, "Hey, girl, can you give me a box," and she was like, "For what?" and I was like, "None of your business."
Lady Havokk
Lives in: Clinton Hill, Brooklyn
What are your pronouns? I use any pronouns that are available and the pronoun "ew."
Tell me a little bit about your outfit? I made my outfit. I went to fashion design school. I was inspired by Kylie Minogue's disco album, so I wanted to do a very, like, '70s, bell bottom pant with sequins. Which, by the way, are all hand sewn by me.
How many sequins? A thousand. I counted them. It took four weeks.
Conor Gallagher and Frederick Gallagher
Live in: Washington, D.C.
I see you're wearing custom merch, some " court core ," if you will. Are you Gwyneth fans?
C.G.: I don't know if I could say I'm a Gwyneth fan as much as I loved the trial. I'm here to reclaim my half a day of skiing.
F.G.: I just wish you well.
When did you make these?
C.G.: Tuesday. It's iron-on letters with a blank tank top from Amazon.
Willow Pill
Lives in: Chicago
Did you have to do any Gwyneth Paltrow research for tonight? I'm mostly familiar with her as an anomaly and less as a celebrity. I wanted to do Goop, which I think most people know and have, at least, heard of some of these absurd products that they have.
What is the most absurd product? They have all sorts of crystals. I don't know if they are scientist recommended, but they are making money off of them.
Have you bought any: Absolutely not, I would never waste my money. I'm making money off of this.
Tea Rose Pankey and Morgan Antisdel
Live in: Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and St. Louis, Mo.
How do you two know each other?
M.A.: This is my sister. We're siblings.
I love your looks. Where did you get them?
M.A.: All of our friends' things!
T.R.P.: I wish I knew the names of the artists, but they're all, like, small Brooklyn businesses. This skirt is from Crown Heights. This top is from a small business on Tompkins. I made this disco bra myself.
Pattaya Hart
Lives in: Washington Heights, Manhattan
What song did you just perform? That was the "Glee" version of "Forget You." I was making this mix until 2 in the morning.
Did you watch "Glee" when it was on the air? I loved "Glee," but I stopped watching it when the plot didn't make sense. So I was like, "Wait, Gwyneth was on this show?"
Joy Dumas
Lives in: Sugar Hill, Manhattan
How did you decide what to wear tonight? I was really trying to channel white woman, to be honest. I've got my Birkenstocks. I went and got myself a blond wig.
This isn't natural? Oh, you're too kind. I've got gold jewelry. I'm just feeling the Gwyneth fantasy.

Congress Signals Forced-Labor Concerns With Chinese Shopping Sites: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A congressional investigation into Temu and Shein offered new insight into services that are delivering a deluge of cheap and little-regulated products.
Lawmakers are flagging what they say are likely significant violations of U.S. law by Temu, a popular Chinese shopping platform, accusing it of providing an unchecked channel that allows goods made with forced labor to flow into the United States.
In a report released Thursday, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said Temu, a rapidly growing site that sells electronics, makeup, toys and clothing, had failed "to maintain even the facade of a meaningful compliance program" for its supply chains and was likely shipping products made with forced labor into the United States on a "regular basis."
The report stems from a continuing investigation into forced labor in supply chains that touch on China. Lawmakers said the report was based on responses submitted to the committee by Temu, as well as the fast fashion retailer Shein, Nike and Adidas.
The report offered a particularly scathing assessment of Temu, saying there is an "extremely high risk that Temu's supply chains are contaminated with forced labor." The site advertises itself under the tagline "Shop like a billionaire" and is now the second most downloaded app in the Apple store.
The report also criticized Shein's use of an importing method that allows companies to bring products into the United States duty-free and with less scrutiny from customs, as long as packages are sent directly to consumers and valued at under $ 800. Some lawmakers have been pushing to close off this shipping channel, which is called de minimis, for companies sourcing goods from China.
Lawmakers said that they were troubled by what the bipartisan committee's investigation had uncovered so far, and that Congress should review import loopholes and strengthen forced labor laws.
"Temu is doing next to nothing to keep its supply chains free from slave labor," said Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who heads the committee. "At the same time, Temu and Shein are building empires around the de minimis loophole in our import rules: dodging import taxes and evading scrutiny on the millions of goods they sell to Americans."
"The initial findings of this report are concerning and reinforce the need for full transparency by companies potentially profiting from C.C.P. forced labor," said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and a co-author of the report, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
Temu, which began operating in the United States in September, told the committee that it now brought millions of shipments into the United States annually through a network of more than 80,000 suppliers that sell directly from Chinese factories to U.S. consumers. The site sells clothing, temporary tattoos, modeling clay, electronics and other items directly to consumers for low prices, like $ 3 for a baby romper, $ 6 for sandals and $ 8 for a vacuum.
The report also contained new data showing that Temu and Shein make heavy use of the de minimis rule, together accounting for almost 600,000 such packages shipped to the United States daily.
The shipping method allows retailers to sell their goods to consumers at cheaper prices, since they are not subject to duties, taxes or government fees that apply to traditional retailers that typically ship overseas goods in bulk.
De minimis shipping also requires far less information to be disclosed about the products and the companies involved in the transaction, making it harder for U.S. customs officials to detect packages with narcotics, counterfeits and goods made with forced labor. The number of de minimis packages entering the United States more than tripled between 2016 and 2021, when it reached 720 million.
At an annualized rate, the shipments reported by Shein and Temu would represent more than 30 percent of the de minimis shipments that came into the United States last year, and nearly half of those packages from China, the report said.
Both Shein and Temu have steadily taken market share from U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers and won over younger consumers by investing in sophisticated e-commerce technology and offering hundreds more new products than competitors. Among teenagers, Shein was the third most popular e-commerce site behind Amazon and Nike, according to a Piper Sandler report this spring.
As their popularity has grown, so has congressional scrutiny of the firms, given their ties to China. Shein was originally based in China but has moved its headquarters to Singapore. Temu, which is based in Boston, is a subsidiary of PDD Holdings, which moved its headquarters to Ireland from China this year.
Lawmakers have been questioning their relationship with the Chinese government, as well as the companies' ability to vet their supply chains to ensure they don't contain materials or products from Xinjiang. Last year, the U.S. imposed a ban on products from Xinjiang, citing the region's use of forced labor in factories and mines.
The Chinese government has carried out a crackdown in Xinjiang on Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, including the organized use of forced labor to pick cotton; work in mines; and manufacture electronics, polysilicon and car parts. Because of this, the U.S. government now presumes all materials from the region to be made with forced labor unless proved otherwise.
Shein said in a statement that it had zero tolerance for forced labor and had a robust compliance system, including a code of conduct, independent audits, robust tracing technology and third-party testing. It provided detailed information to the House committee and will continue to answer its questions, the company said.
"We have no contract manufacturers in the Xinjiang region," it said. "As a global company, our policy is to comply with the customs and import laws of the countries in which we operate."
Temu did not respond to a request for comment.
Laboratory tests commissioned by Bloomberg News in November found that some Shein clothing had been made with cotton from Xinjiang. Shein didn't dispute those findings, but said in a statement to Bloomberg that it took steps in all global markets to comply with local laws and had engaged another lab, Oritain, to test its materials.
The congressional report also criticized Temu's failure to set up a compliance or auditing system that could independently verify that its sellers were not sourcing products from Xinjiang.
Temu told the committee that it had a reporting system that consumers and sellers could use to file complaints, and that it asked its sellers to sign a code of conduct specifying a "zero-tolerance policy" for the use of forced, indentured or penal labor. Temu's code of conduct also says the company reserves the right to inspect factories and warehouses to ensure compliance.
But the code does not mention Xinjiang or the U.S. ban, and Temu told the House committee that it did not prohibit vendors from selling products made in Xinjiang, the report said.
Temu also argued that its use of direct shipping meant that the U.S. consumer, not Temu, would bear the ultimate responsibility for adhering to the ban on Xinjiang goods.
"Temu is not the importer of record with respect to goods shipped to the United States," the report quoted it as saying.
Customs lawyers said that it was not entirely clear which party would be liable for complying with the U.S. ban, but that any company facilitating the importation of goods from Xinjiang could face civil or criminal penalties.
The committee report also pictured a key chain that was listed on Temu's website this month and labeled "pendant with Xinjiang cotton." The key chain itself is shaped like a bud of cotton, and the report said that the Xinjiang label "may refer to the materials, the supplier, the pattern or the origin of the product."
Temu's "policy to not prohibit the sale of products that explicitly advertise their Xinjiang origins, even in the face of mounting congressional and public scrutiny on related topics, raises serious questions," the report said.
The New York Times was not able to verify whether the product is made using Xinjiang cotton, which is barred under U.S. law. The Times found an identical product listed for sale on a Chinese wholesale site that was described as manufactured in Henan Province, outside Xinjiang.
A Times review of information shared by Temu vendors on Chinese social media sites also suggested that Temu did not require sellers to provide detailed information about where their products were made or which companies manufactured them.
Vendors sharing tips online about Temu's product review process gave several reasons that Temu commonly rejected new listings: for example, if the price was too high, if the samples were inconsistent with the photos or if the goods lacked consumer warning labels. But none mentioned concerns about links to Xinjiang or the U.S. import ban.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A constant hum drones out of a former church in San Francisco. It is the sound, from hundreds of fans cooling hundreds of computer servers, of the digital past being kept alive. This is the Internet Archive, the largest collection of archived web pages in the world and a constant reminder of the fragility of our digital past. It is also, thanks to a March ruling in a federal court, which found that the archive's lending practices violate publishers' rights, just one battlefield in a growing struggle that will define how humanity's collective digital memory is owned, shared and preserved -- or lost forever.
As a scholar of digital data, I know that not all data loss -- the corrosion and destruction of our digital past -- is tragic. But much data loss today occurs in ways that are deeply unjust and that have monumental implications for both culture and politics. Few nonprofit organizations or publicly backed digital libraries are able to operate at the scale needed to truly democratize control of digital knowledge. Which means important decisions about how these issues play out are left to powerful, profit-driven corporations or political leaders with agendas. Understanding these forces is a critical step toward managing, mitigating and ultimately controlling data loss and, with it, the conditions under which our societies remember and forget.
From streaming platforms removing digital-only shows from their libraries to governments defunding their national library systems to the effects of tech centralization, data is disappearing at alarming rates. Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive's founder, told me that thanks to government pressure or simply error, data is often subject to large-scale erasure. For web pages that have been wiped clean, the Internet Archive is often the only place to look.
Traditional publishers brought the suit against the archive because of its practice of lending, for short periods, scans of their books (including, to authors' dislike, recently published titles). The court ruled that the archive must stop lending copyrighted books. An appeal is in the works, but if the court ruling is upheld, it could seriously undermine the ability of the archive and similar bodies to defend public access to information against the encroachment of privately held platforms, according to Mr. Kahle.
Every technological revolution entails a loss. Socrates warned in Plato's "Phaedrus" that the invention of writing destroyed memory, making people "hearers of many things" who "will have learned nothing." More recently, the typewriter enabled the production of far more paperwork, raising profound anxieties about the number of lost, displaced and missing documents. Today's digital societies echo these historic patterns of loss, neglect and entropy. But new actors and dynamics have also entered the stage. Public spheres now exist precariously at the mercy of social media companies. And each day, corporations like Amazon, Alphabet and Meta extract and assetize our data, stockpiling it and monetizing it under dubious consent structures.
The fact that crucial decisions about whether to keep or destroy data are kept in the hands of actors with profit motives, autocratic aspirations or other self-serving ends has a huge implication not only for individuals but also for the culture at large.
Many instances of data loss have ramifications for cultural production, the writing of history and, ultimately, the practice of democracy. Some politicians -- including ones who oversee funding for digital archives -- have dubious relationships with record-keeping best practices. British officials have been accused in court of government by WhatsApp, relying on self-deleting messaging applications to avoid oversight and accountability. A similar scandal engulfed Denmark's prime minister in 2021.
Tech companies, too, have a record of questionable policies around data, content moderation and censorship. They have their own motives -- including a business model based on generating different data enclosures and on hardware and software obsolescence -- and exist in a complex political and regulatory ecosystem. That ecosystem often offers perverse incentives to both maximize profit by selectively storing some data and reduce regulatory burdens by removing access to other data. Marginalized communities may be particularly vulnerable. During the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, some activists accused social media sites like Facebook of censoring their posts. Platform removal of adult content disproportionately affects queer communities. And in conflict zones, regimes and content moderation systems frequently remove material that could be crucial evidence in war crimes investigations.
Many cultural forms are now almost entirely dependent on digital formats. While films and music were once available for purchase in a physical form, many are now digital only. Even books are sometimes released only for e-readers. That places enormous power in the hands of mostly for-profit companies, including streaming services and music platforms like Spotify, to control the dissemination of art. Platforms like Max (formerly HBO Max) have removed films and TV shows from their streaming services en masse; though some are available elsewhere, there was suddenly no legal way to watch many other programs. Even the creators of some shows could not view their own work.
Of course, not everything is worth preserving. Archivists and librarians learn how to weed and appraise files to be kept or deleted. In internet spaces, these practices, which can help create meaning, are known as digital housekeeping. And some nongovernmental organizations and governments -- notably that of the European Union -- promote data policies that are premised on destruction, such as the "right to erasure."
While the history of data loss spans millenniums, digital data storage has produced fundamentally new challenges and preservation crises. The decentralized nature of the internet generates link rot and content drift; the inherently dynamic and unstable nature of digital information -- premised on constant information migration -- is another risk. Natural disasters and fires threaten digital as well as physical archives.
These challenges require new and innovative solutions. Some organizations have embraced radical methods to confront them. There now exists an Arctic Code Vault alongside the Global Seed Vault on Svalbard in the Norwegian high Arctic. But protecting code in a frozen, disused mine shaft does not address the broader need to rethink the power structures that govern data's ownership and control.
For the sake of democratic accountability, governments should stop relying on privately owned communication platforms for the day-to-day operations of public administration and should place a higher priority on public archiving.
Alongside the need to maintain public trust in democratic institutions, we must consider how we ought to preserve our collective cultural memory. Institutions like museums, libraries and archives must play a more proactive role while creating stronger institutional safeguards -- including rules mandating secure transport of public sector data and professional management of archives, in addition to requirements for public accessibility -- on their own conduct. These organizations, whether they are upstart archival initiatives or established public institutions, require stable financial and institutional support to flourish.
Beyond the everyday functions of government and the preservation of cultural memory, digital societies must also ensure that critical data on human rights abuses is protected from erasure, both intentional and accidental.
But as we consider fundamental regulatory changes, we must also recognize that letting some data go might be just as ethical as preserving it.
The history of knowledge is not one of simple progress or accumulation. Knowledge production in the digital era, like the creation and storage of knowledge across the centuries, is unfolding as a continual oscillation between gains and losses.
Data loss on a small scale -- missing phone contacts, digital files lost to a glitch -- is the occupational hazard of existing in a digitally reliant world. But data erasure at scale is always political. Responses to erasure and loss must exceed technical fixes and knee-jerk reactions; instead, governments and organizations must constantly reassess the ethical and regulatory frameworks that govern our relationship with data. The mainstream narrative that we are living through an era of exponential, near-infinite knowledge accumulation no longer fits a society in which we lose our collective record of ourselves day in and day out.

Failures of Globalization Shatter Long-Held Beliefs: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: While the world's eyes were on the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and China, the paths to prosperity and shared interests have grown murkier.
When the world's business and political leaders gathered in 2018 at the annual economic forum in Davos, the mood was jubilant. Growth in every major country was on an upswing. The global economy, declared Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, "is in a very sweet spot."
Five years later, the outlook has decidedly soured.
"Nearly all the economic forces that powered progress and prosperity over the last three decades are fading," the World Bank warned in a recent analysis. "The result could be a lost decade in the making -- not just for some countries or regions as has occurred in the past -- but for the whole world."
A lot has happened between then and now: A global pandemic hit; war erupted in Europe; tensions between the United States and China boiled. And inflation, thought to be safely stored away with disco album collections, returned with a vengeance.
But as the dust has settled, it has suddenly seemed as if almost everything we thought we knew about the world economy was wrong.
The economic conventions that policymakers had relied on since the Berlin Wall fell more than 30 years ago -- the unfailing superiority of open markets, liberalized trade and maximum efficiency -- look to be running off the rails.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, the ceaseless drive to integrate the global economy and reduce costs left health care workers without face masks and medical gloves, carmakers without semiconductors, sawmills without lumber and sneaker buyers without Nikes.
The idea that trade and shared economic interests would prevent military conflicts was trampled last year under the boots of Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
And increasing bouts of extreme weather that destroyed crops, forced migrations and halted power plants has illustrated that the market's invisible hand was not protecting the planet.
Now, as the second year of war in Ukraine grinds on and countries struggle with limp growth and persistent inflation, questions about the emerging economic playing field have taken center stage.
Globalization, seen in recent decades as unstoppable a force as gravity, is clearly evolving in unpredictable ways. The move away from an integrated world economy is accelerating. And the best way to respond is a subject of fierce debate.
Of course, challenges to the reigning economic consensus had been growing for a while.
"We saw before the pandemic began that the wealthiest countries were getting frustrated by international trade, believing -- whether correctly or not -- that somehow this was hurting them, their jobs and standards of living," said Betsey Stevenson, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration.
The financial meltdown in 2008 came close to tanking the global financial system. Britain pulled out of the European Union in 2016. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on China in 2017, spurring a mini trade war.
But starting with Covid-19, the rat-a-tat series of crises exposed with startling clarity vulnerabilities that demanded attention.
As the consulting firm EY concluded in its 2023 Geostrategic Outlook, the trends behind the shift away from ever-increasing globalization "were accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic -- and then they have been supercharged by the war in Ukraine."
It was the 'end of history.'
Today's sense of unease is a stark contrast with the heady triumphalism that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. It was a period when a theorist could declare that the fall of communism marked "the end of history" -- that liberal democratic ideas not only vanquished rivals, but represented "the end point of mankind's ideological evolution."
Associated economic theories about the ineluctable rise of worldwide free market capitalism took on a similar sheen of invincibility and inevitability. Open markets, hands-off government and the relentless pursuit of efficiency would offer the best route to prosperity.
It was believed that a new world where goods, money and information crisscrossed the globe would essentially sweep away the old order of Cold War conflicts and undemocratic regimes.
There was reason for optimism. During the 1990s, inflation was low while employment, wages and productivity were up. Global trade nearly doubled. Investments in developing countries surged. The stock market rose.
The World Trade Organization was established in 1995 to enforce the rules. China's entry six years later was seen as transformative. And linking a huge market with 142 countries would irresistibly draw the Asian giant toward democracy.
China, along with South Korea, Malaysia and others, turned struggling farmers into productive urban factory workers. The furniture, toys and electronics they sold around the world generated tremendous growth.
The favored economic road map helped produce fabulous wealth, lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and spur wondrous technological advances.
But there were stunning failures as well. Globalization hastened climate change and deepened inequalities.
In the United States and other advanced economies, many industrial jobs were exported to lower-wage countries, removing a springboard to the middle class.
Policymakers always knew there would be winners and losers. Still, the market was left to decide how to deploy labor, technology and capital in the belief that efficiency and growth would automatically follow. Only afterward, the thinking went, should politicians step in to redistribute gains or help those left without jobs or prospects.
Companies embarked on a worldwide scavenger hunt for low-wage workers, regardless of worker protections, environmental impact or democratic rights. They found many of them in places like Mexico, Vietnam and China.
Television, T-shirts and tacos were cheaper than ever, but many essentials like health care, housing and higher education were increasingly out of reach.
The job exodus pushed down wages at home and undercut workers' bargaining power, spurring anti-immigrant sentiments and strengthening hard-right populist leaders like Donald Trump in the United States, Viktor Orban in Hungary and Marine Le Pen in France.
In advanced industrial giants like the United States, Britain and several European countries, political leaders turned out to be unable or unwilling to more broadly reapportion rewards and burdens.
Nor were they able to prevent damaging environmental fallout. Transporting goods around the globe increased greenhouse gas emissions. Producing for a world of consumers strained natural resources, encouraging overfishing in Southeast Asia and illegal deforestation in Brazil. And cheap production facilities polluted countries without adequate environmental standards.
It turned out that markets on their own weren't able to automatically distribute gains fairly or spur developing countries to grow or establish democratic institutions.
Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said in a recent speech that a central fallacy in American economic policy had been to assume "that markets always allocate capital productively and efficiently -- no matter what our competitors did, no matter how big our shared challenges grew, and no matter how many guardrails we took down."
The proliferation of economic exchanges between nations also failed to usher in a promised democratic renaissance.
Communist-led China turned out to be the global economic system's biggest beneficiary -- and perhaps master gamesman -- without embracing democratic values.
"Capitalist tools in socialist hands," the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said in 1992, when his country was developing into the world's factory floor. China's astonishing growth transformed it into the world's second largest economy and a major engine of global growth. All along, though, Beijing maintained a tight grip on its raw materials, land, capital, energy, credit and labor, as well as the movements and speech of its people.
Money flowed in, and poor countries paid the price.
In developing countries, the results could be dire.
The economic havoc wreaked by the pandemic combined with soaring food and fuel prices caused by the war in Ukraine have created a spate of debt crises. Rising interest rates have made those crises worse. Debts, like energy and food, are often priced in dollars on the world market, so when U.S. rates go up, debt payments get more expensive.
The cycle of loans and bailouts, though, has deeper roots.
Poorer nations were pressured to lift all restrictions on capital moving in and out of the country. The argument was that money, like goods, should flow freely among nations. Allowing governments, businesses and individuals to borrow from foreign lenders would finance industrial development and key infrastructure.
"Financial globalization was supposed to usher in an era of robust growth and fiscal stability in the developing world," said Jayati Ghosh, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. But "it ended up doing the opposite."
Some loans -- whether from private lenders or institutions like the World Bank -- didn't produce enough returns to pay off the debt. Others were poured into speculative schemes, half-baked proposals, vanity projects or corrupt officials' bank accounts. And debtors remained at the mercy of rising interest rates that swelled the size of debt payments in a heartbeat.
Over the years, reckless lending, asset bubbles, currency fluctuations and official mismanagement led to boom-and-bust cycles in Asia, Russia, Latin America and elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, extravagant projects undertaken by the government, from ports to cricket stadiums, helped drive the country into bankruptcy last year as citizens scavenged for food and the central bank, in a barter arrangement, paid for Iranian oil with tea leaves.
It's a "Ponzi scheme," Ms. Ghosh said.
Private lenders who got spooked that they would not be repaid abruptly cut off the flow of money, leaving countries in the lurch.
And the mandated austerity that accompanied bailouts from the International Monetary Fund, which compelled overextended governments to slash spending, often brought widespread misery by cutting public assistance, pensions, education and health care.
Even I.M.F. economists acknowledged in 2016 that instead of delivering growth, such policies "increased inequality, in turn jeopardizing durable expansion."
Disenchantment with the West's style of lending gave China the opportunity to become an aggressive creditor in countries like Argentina, Mongolia, Egypt and Suriname.
Self-reliance replaces cheap imports.
While the collapse of the Soviet Union cleared the way for the domination of free-market orthodoxy, the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has now decisively unmoored it.
The story of the international economy today, said Henry Farrell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is about "how geopolitics is gobbling up hyperglobalization."
Old-world style great power politics accomplished what the threat of catastrophic climate collapse, seething social unrest and widening inequality could not: It upended assumptions about the global economic order.
Josep Borrell, the European Union's head of foreign affairs and security policy, put it bluntly in a speech 10 months after the invasion of Ukraine: "We have decoupled the sources of our prosperity from the sources of our security." Europe got cheap energy from Russia and cheap manufactured goods from China. "This is a world that is no longer there," he said.
Supply-chain chokeholds stemming from the pandemic and subsequent recovery had already underscored the fragility of a globally sourced economy. As political tensions over the war grew, policymakers quickly added self-reliance and strength to the goals of growth and efficiency.
"Our supply chains are not secure, and they're not resilient," Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said last spring. Trade relationships should be built around "trusted partners," she said, even if it means "a somewhat higher level of cost, a somewhat less efficient system."
"It was naïve to think that markets are just about efficiency and that they're not also about power," said Abraham Newman, a co-author with Mr. Farrell of "Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy."
Economic networks, by their very nature, create power imbalances and pressure points because countries have varying capabilities, resources and vulnerabilities.
Russia, which had supplied 40 percent of the European Union's natural gas, tried to use that dependency to pressure the bloc to withdraw its support of Ukraine.
The United States and its allies used their domination of the global financial system to remove major Russian banks from the international payments system.
China has retaliated against trading partners by restricting access to its enormous market.
The extreme concentrations of critical suppliers and information technology networks has generated additional choke points.
China manufactures 80 percent of the world's solar panels. Taiwan produces 92 percent of tiny advanced semiconductors. Much of the world's trade and transactions are figured in U.S. dollars.
The new reality is reflected in American policy. The United States -- the central architect of the liberalized economic order and the World Trade Organization -- has turned away from more comprehensive free trade agreements and repeatedly refused to abide by W.T.O. decisions.
Security concerns have led the Biden administration to block Chinese investment in American businesses and limit China's access to private data on citizens and to new technologies.
And it has embraced Chinese-style industrial policy, offering gargantuan subsidies for electric vehicles, batteries, wind farms, solar plants and more to secure supply chains and speed the transition to renewable energy.
"Ignoring the economic dependencies that had built up over the decades of liberalization had become really perilous," Mr. Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said. Adherence to "oversimplified market efficiency," he added, proved to be a mistake.
While the previous economic orthodoxy has been partly abandoned, it is not clear what will replace it. Improvisation is the order of the day. Perhaps the only assumption that can be confidently relied on now is that the path to prosperity and policy trade-offs will become murkier.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At a rally on Saturday hosted by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., President Biden enjoyed a warm reception. But changes in union membership mean that he still has work to do.
The public image of President Biden's "Union Joe" persona rests largely on his longtime affiliations with labor unions representing police officers, firefighters and building-trade workers.
But the modern labor movement that gathered on Saturday in Philadelphia to endorse Mr. Biden's 2024 re-election campaign is younger and more diverse, and has far more women than the union stereotype Mr. Biden has embraced during the decades he has spent building his political identity.
"You think about it as the dude with a cigar, and it's just not that," said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. "I'm sure there's still dudes with cigars, but there's lots and lots and lots of other people in a multigenerational, multiracial cacophony of people that are unified by a zealous fight for a better life."
While today's labor movement is demographically more in line with the Democratic Party, increasing the share of young people and people of color means that union members may be less familiar with -- and more skeptical about -- Mr. Biden's record.
Mr. Biden's campaign and the labor leaders who endorsed it -- the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and 17 other unions -- celebrated the early backing as a triumph of labor unity for the president. The president appeared before a supportive and energetic audience of about 2,000 union members in Philadelphia, the first rally of his re-election campaign since it started in April.
"I'm the most pro-union president in American history," Mr. Biden told the cheering crowd on Saturday, echoing a vow he made during his 2020 campaign. Predicting another victory in 2024, he added: "What I'm really proud about is being re-elected the most pro-union president in history."
The endorsements reflect Mr. Biden's popularity among the unions' leaders, but large segments of the union membership do not associate him with the union-friendly legislation he has signed into law.
"There is a disconnect between all the Biden-Harris accomplishments and what information is landing on the ground in communities," said Liz Shuler, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "It is such an inside-the-Beltway thing to do to talk about policies and talk about legislation and regulations. It's up to us to decode that and connect the dots back to what is happening in Washington."
Upon entering office, Mr. Biden pledged to be "the most pro-union president you've ever seen," and he has largely delivered on that promise.
During the Philadelphia union rally -- officially hosted by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. but with all the trappings of a Biden campaign event -- Mr. Biden ticked through his pro-union accomplishments. Along with the climate, infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing bills he signed that incentivize companies that employ unionized workers, Mr. Biden cited the Butch Lewis Act, which restored the pensions of more than one million people whose retirement benefits had been severely reduced because of underfunded multi-employer pension plans.
"That was a big deal," Mr. Biden said. "It was one of the most significant achievements for union workers and retirees in 50 years."
The Biden administration has made clear that it stands with unionized workers. Jill Biden, the first lady, wore the blue T-shirt of the National Education Association on Saturday. Last weekend, Mr. Biden's education secretary, Miguel Cardona, refused to cross a picket line to give a commencement address at the University of Washington. Vice President Kamala Harris canceled an MTV appearance after Hollywood writers went on strike.
Last month, workers at a school bus factory in Georgia won the first significant organizing election at a facility receiving major federal funding under legislation signed by Mr. Biden.
The president has also been far more vocal than his Democratic predecessors in encouraging union organizing. Last year, Mr. Biden welcomed to the White House the millennial Amazon and Starbucks organizers who had unionized parts of those companies.
Before he was president, Mr. Biden was a regular at Labor Day parades -- especially in Pittsburgh, home of the largely male and white steelworker unions that built much of western Pennsylvania, and where he kicked off his 2020 campaign.
That run followed a defection of large numbers of union workers to Donald J. Trump's 2016 campaign, which had reoriented the Republican Party in opposition to international free trade accords championed by Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.
That helped Mr. Trump shave off traditionally Democratic union voters. When Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, she won just 51 percent of votes from union households, while Mr. Trump won by huge margins among white working class voters, according to exit polls at the time. Four years later, Mr. Biden took 56 percent of votes from union households, and union voters made up a slightly larger share of the electorate.
"The labor movement is changing, no question. We are having a younger and more diverse work force," said Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "We are seeing a revitalization among young people and people of color who see that they're being mistreated and they don't have a true seat at the table."
Martin J. Walsh, Mr. Biden's first labor secretary who is now the executive director of the pro hockey players' union, said the early endorsements from organized labor were clear attempts to give union leaders more time to press Mr. Biden's case to their members.
"Having so many unions coming out so early in the process tells you that the unions are solidifying their membership early and working their members early, so they don't have a repeat of what happened in 2016," Mr. Walsh said.
Among the youngest labor leaders is Roland Rexha, the secretary-treasurer of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association, which represents maritime workers including employees of the Staten Island Ferry. Mr. Rexha, who at 41 is the youngest member and the only Muslim on the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council, said it can be difficult to sell Mr. Biden to a group that was about three-quarters white men -- a group with whom Mr. Trump has drawn majority support.
"Most labor unions do a good job of trying to explain to the members why they need to support the people that support them," Mr. Rexha said. "It's something that as leadership, we have had a hard time sometimes relaying to them."
The broad union endorsements for Mr. Biden Saturday mask some discontent for the president among organized labor. The United Auto Workers has withheld an endorsement over concerns about the electric vehicle transition the White House has championed. There was significant grumbling among labor groups that on the day Mr. Biden launched his campaign, he spoke to the building trades union -- a group whose members are seen within the labor world as less reliably Democratic.
And then there is the fact that Mr. Biden's much-touted infrastructure legislation will largely benefit construction workers -- a group far more likely to be male and to vote Republican than the rest of the organized labor universe.
"There is some real progress, ironically, for construction workers, probably half of whom voted for Trump twice," said Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America who has long been an adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
"The messaging is as good as it's ever been in 50 years or more, but there needs to be results."

Beloved Furniture Gets a Brand-New Life: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: E-commerce sites like Facebook Marketplace have given unloved pieces a second (or third?) chance at a new beginning, and a provenance they would never have had.
In the summer of 2019, Jacqueline Lobel, a 33-year-old TV producer, was scrolling through Craigslist, optimistically hoping to buy a dining room table that would fit into a slightly dark space in the large studio apartment she had just moved into in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.
"When I saw how this apartment was staged before I rented it, I was inspired to do the same layout, so I knew what kind of table I needed," she said.
Two months into her search, she saw a post that promised a gorgeous, 42-inch walnut wood and brass dining room table in good condition. It was part of the décor at Günter Seeger, a Michelin-starred restaurant that was closing in the West Village. The custom-made table retailed for $ 3,000. The proprietors were offering it for $ 500. She bought it for that price.
"I met the owners and could tell they were sad about selling these pieces. There's romanticism and story behind them," said Ms. Lobel, who has learned that anything and everything is findable -- and sellable -- on e-commerce sites, especially Facebook Marketplace.
So naturally Ms. Lobel turned to Facebook Marketplace two years later when that same table fell out of favor.
"I loved it, but I was too precious about damaging it to use it," she said. "I think I had two or three dinners on it before it became a visual clutter and dumping ground for packages."
Despite the awkwardness Ms. Lobel said she feels when interacting with strangers, she loves enthusiastic buyers who will give her furniture "a happy place" to live. "I'm continuing a cycle. I'm getting rid of something to bring something else in." (Last year she scored an impressive vintage camel leather couch for $ 50.)
She posted photos and descriptions of the table in November 2022, but it sat unclaimed for a month before she refreshed the posting. The following day, the table was spotted by Ruth Gallogly, 51, a freelance writer and consultant who lives in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn.
After a few messages and some texts, Ms. Gallogly said she sent over "a guy with a van that I use when something needs to be picked up." The mover measured the piece, confirmed it was the right size, and Ms. Gallogly paid Ms. Lobel $ 500 by Venmo.
An hour later it glowed in Ms. Gallogly's kitchen in her one-bedroom co-op. "Now it's become this warm, welcoming hosting spot," said Ms. Gallogly, who had been trying to fill the space since she renovated her apartment in 2021. "I loved the table, but I also loved the back story and the history this piece of furniture had to tell," she said. "I share it with everyone who visits."
And so it goes. A furniture handoff sparking an unexpected relationship.
"People are looking for connection. Through this transaction you're continuing a thread through a shared piece of furniture," said Charles Lindsey, an associate professor of marketing at University at Buffalo School of Management, whose focus is on the psychology of consumption and consumer behavior.
"That's how you can share a piece of someone's life," Mr. Lindsey added. "It's also the new story you're creating by extending the history of something that someone owned by how you display it and embrace that item. It makes buying something from someone else psychologically attractive."
E-commerce sites offer that attraction to millions of consumers, from the amateur sleuth to the full-blown shopping addict.
Ms. Gallogly, who likes the hunt, has furnished her home over the past year with more than 20 items from Marketplace. "I'm one of those people who knows what I like once I see it but who has a hard time visualizing how things will look in a space or what colors will work well together," she said.
Sylvain Sénécal, a marketing professor at the business school HEC Montreal who specializes in digital marketing and consumer behavior, said Ms. Gallogly was not alone.
"The social proof and inspiration these items create when someone sees how one person highlighted it in their apartment and how someone else can do the same in their home is part of the draw," he said. "For potential buyers, that becomes aspirational. It triggers something that increases their willingness to buy something."
Last year, Mr. Sénécal conducted an online experiment. He showed 335 participants a dozen photos from a pool of 60. In some, the photos showed only a bare table or bed. Others were staged to reflect a lived-in environment or an indication that a person had a personal connection to it.
"The staged shots increased the person's emotions, motivation or intention to buy the product," he said. "They have an easier time imagining that item in their home, especially if they think the item was connected to happiness."
Like many shoppers, Ms. Gallogly doesn't identify as just a buyer, she also quickly became a seller, adding to the momentum of a continuous furniture circulating chain. In 2019 she purchased a gray and white marbleized oval coffee table from CB2, which she adored. That feeling never changed, but her surroundings did. After the renovation, it no longer went with the décor.
"The idea that this was in my home and I loved it, and that I'm able to pass this along to someone else who will love it is very settling," she said.
She posted the oval table at the end of December 2022. At $ 400, it wasn't getting any inquiries. She lowered the price to $ 350. Then $ 300.
When Kristen Daibes and her husband moved from their small one-bedroom rental in Edgewater, N.J., in 2020 into a 1920s colonial-style three-bedroom house in Harrington Park, N.J., they suddenly had extra rooms to furnish.
Ms. Daibes, a 30-year-old elementary teacher, wanted something oval that was white and gray to complete a family room, and spent six months scrolling on Marketplace. She was instantly smitten with Ms. Gallogly's table, but it was out of her budget until the price dropped. When it went to $ 275, she pounced. In January of 2023, she stood alongside her husband, Ghanem Daibes, in Ms. Gallogly's hallway.
"Once I saw it, I started envisioning it in our room, with a candle placed on it, and yelling at my husband for not using a coaster," she said. "I'm a big secondhand person, my husband is not. I had to sell him on this concept, and the coffee table."
The piece now resides alongside a piano and two couches, under a skylight in their family room. "As unsentimental and boring as a coffee table is, there's an acknowledgment that someone loved this item in their home and it is now in mine. I'm giving it a second life," she added.
Ms. Daibes's satisfaction and sentimentality, which seemed rather passionate in the beginning, was surprisingly short lived.
"None of these pieces last in our home forever," she added. "I'll probably sell it in a few years."
Her ability to maintain detachment is what led her to sell a full-length mirrored door, that when opened, revealed drawers, compartments and countless slots to hold jewelry, which she bought on Amazon in 2017 for over $ 200.
"It was important to have at the time. When we moved, it didn't fit with our home and I didn't have the jewelry to fill it."
No worries. Mary Jo Birrittieri-Parente had plenty of jewelry.
Early in the pandemic, Ms. Daibes and Ms. Birrittieri-Parente met in a busy Target's parking lot in Closter, N.J., to do a handoff, three days after Ms. Daibes posted it on Marketplace.
"I got involved in Marketplace during Covid because stores were closed or they didn't have inventory," said Ms. Birrittieri-Parente, a 51-year-old, former medical receptionist, who lives in a two-bedroom condominium in Bergen County, N.J., with her daughter.
Ms. Birrittieri-Parente, a single parent who appreciates the bargains offered by sites like Marketplace, has accumulated more than 90 pieces of costume jewelry. "I needed something that would organize them all in one place and I needed a full-length mirror," she said.
The exchange in the parking lot lasted only a few minutes, and after Ms. Birrittieri-Parente determined the piece reflected what the photos promised, handed over the negotiated price: $ 30 in cash, down from the original ask of $ 60. The multitasking armoire fit into her black SUV. Minutes later it was propped up in her bedroom.
"This breathed new life into me and this room while making it more modern," she said. "Everything has its own place now. I love that it's white and goes with my furniture. It doesn't matter that it was someone else's. It's brand-new to me and my home."
The furniture tango is always moving and constantly changing partners. Sometimes the dance is easy, other times, not so much.
Ms. Lobel, who felt an emotional loss at selling the round table, was soothed by quickly filling the once empty space with a bookshelf, chest and reading chair -- all bought secondhand, and by the fact that Ms. Gallogly was so thrilled at the find, and purchase.
"It was a beautiful piece. But I empathized with Ruth deeply," she said. "I was her three years ago looking for a beautiful round table. Knowing I helped her find that made it more sweet than bitter."

It's a New Broadcast World. Can the N.C.A.A. Take Advantage?: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Many college sports championships, including the marquee women's basketball tournament, have been sold as a bundle. The prospect of selling separately raises questions for dozens of sports.
For more than 20 years, fans of college sports like softball, baseball, women's basketball and more than two dozen others have known just where to find N.C.A.A. championships -- on ESPN's spectrum of channels.
The arrangement has worked well for both parties: The N.C.A.A. ensured that its top athletes would perform on a national stage, and ESPN added hundreds of hours of live programming to a college sports portfolio that is anchored by college football and men's basketball games.
A sign of how comfortable the N.C.A.A. and ESPN were with their partnership came in 2011, when they agreed to a 13-year, $ 500 million renewal without the N.C.A.A.'s ever taking the rights to market.
Now, though, with that deal set to expire in a year, it is increasingly likely that the next media rights deal for those 31 championships will look much different from the current one, which has been widely criticized as undervalued -- particularly for its marquee event, the Division I women's basketball tournament.
Addressing the upcoming negotiations, Charlie Baker, who took office as the new N.C.A.A. president in March, pointedly acknowledged last week at a symposium on college sports that "we dramatically underperform across a whole bunch of other revenue-raising opportunities."
The increase in interest in women's basketball has amplified pressure on the N.C.A.A. to sell those tournament rights by themselves rather than in a bundle with other championships. Doing so could fetch about $ 100 million annually, according to one analyst. Such an unbundling, though, could risk leaving other sports on lower-profile platforms.
And while the women's basketball tournament, coming off record-smashing attendance and television ratings, is heading to market at a seemingly opportune moment, the industry is in turmoil as broadcasters navigate a transition away from cable, which continues to bleed subscribers, and toward streaming platforms, which still have far smaller audiences.
There is much for the N.C.A.A. to consider. Have the interests changed at ESPN, whose parent company, Disney, is in the midst of slashing 7,000 jobs? What about at other networks, like CBS and NBC, which have fewer cable networks but do have fledgling streaming platforms? And might streaming-only companies like Apple, Amazon and YouTube, which have selectively begun to acquire sports rights, be players?
The N.C.A.A. declined to make Baker or any other official available for an interview, saying in a statement that it "is open to any and all new and creative ideas -- including potentially having stand-alone contracts -- to generate revenue to support student-athletes and continue to grow all sports, including women's basketball."
The N.C.A.A. has hired Endeavor, a global sports media company, to help develop its strategy for negotiations, which have not yet begun. Baker has said he expects a rights deal to be completed around the end of the year.
"The N.C.A.A. is a very political organization, and you're living in a different world of politics than you were 10, 15, 20 years ago when these deals got struck," said Chris Bevilacqua, a sports media analyst who previously advised the N.C.A.A. on media rights. "There are 500,000 N.C.A.A. student-athletes, and half are women, so there's going to be a lot of political pressure to architect something that is consistent with that narrative of investing in women's sports."
That pressure stems from a 2021 N.C.A.A. basketball gender equity review, which was commissioned after widespread disparities were identified between the N.C.A.A. men's and women's basketball tournaments during the pandemic.
In the report, Ed Desser, a sports media analyst, estimated then that if the rights to the women's tournament were sold on their own, they could have fetched between $ 81 million and $ 112 million for the 2025 tournament.
ESPN paid close to $ 50 million for the 31 championships this year, including the women's basketball title game, which drew a record 9.9 million viewers on ABC.
"The value has only increased" since his estimate two years ago, Desser said in an interview. He cited not only the increase in attention for the women's tournament, but increasing interest in professional women's basketball and soccer leagues.
Still, the surge in interest in women's sports has not necessarily translated to a boom in rights fees. In soccer, for example, FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, threatened blackouts in several European countries of games from this summer's Women's World Cup before a deal was struck this week. Broadcasters were hesitant to meet FIFA's asking price for the games, which were being sold as stand-alone properties for the first time. Previously, they were bundled with the rights to the men's World Cup.
Women's basketball history over the last 30 years has been dotted with spikes and plateaus. The rise of Connecticut as a foil to Tennessee dovetailed into the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where the United States romped to the gold medal, a dominant run that helped start the N.B.A.-backed W.N.B.A. a year later.
By 2012, interest in the college sport had stagnated to the point that the N.C.A.A. commissioned Val Ackerman, the first president of the W.N.B.A., to study how to bolster interest in the game.
During the pandemic, as many sports were shut down, the murder of George Floyd prompted a wave of social activism in the United States. The W.N.B.A. and women's college basketball leaned into that, and among other causes they questioned the many differences with the men's versions of their sports, including the inequitable weight rooms (and coronavirus tests) during the 2021 men's and women's N.C.A.A. tournaments. More recently, another cause arrived: the detention of the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner in Russia.
All this happened amid the loosening of N.C.A.A. rules prohibiting athletes from signing endorsement deals. That amplified the personalities of the top college women's players, who, unlike the men, are not allowed entry into the W.N.B.A. until they turn 22 (in their draft year) or graduate from college. In recent years, players like Sabrina Ionescu, Paige Bueckers, Aliyah Boston and Caitlin Clark became nationally known.
"We said it might take a generation" to gain a foothold, Ackerman said of the start of the W.N.B.A. "Now, the question for me is can this vibe be taken advantage of commercially? Will there be more tickets at higher prices? Will sponsors be paying higher rights fees? That's the test here. That's what's being put to market."
This is, however, a complicated time to go to market.
Even though cable subscriptions continue to plummet and nascent streaming platforms continue to build subscriber bases, there remain far more cable viewers than streaming viewers. (ESPN is in 72.5 million homes this month, according to Nielsen; ESPN+ has 25.3 million subscribers, a spokesman said.)
Such uncertainty is likely to shorten any N.C.A.A. deals.
Mike Aresco, the commissioner of the American Athletic Conference and a former CBS and ESPN executive, said media companies had generally preferred contracts of a decade or longer so they could focus on building up the telecasts instead of renegotiating the rights.
But lengthy deals have left the Pac-12 and Atlantic Coast conferences far behind the Big Ten, whose decision in 2017 to renew its media rights for just six years set it up for a seven-year, nearly $ 7 billion deal that begins this football season. It is also difficult to predict what the streaming and cable worlds will look like in five years, let alone 10.
"Everybody is rethinking how far out we'll go," Aresco said. "It's not an exact science. In fact, it's probably more art than science."
Even if the money ends up in the same place -- eventually wending its way back to colleges' coffers -- conference media rights deals are fundamentally different from what the N.C.A.A. will be selling. A conference agreement extends over the course of a season, while the N.C.A.A. is selling playoffs or championship events, which are condensed into a matter of days or weeks.
The women's basketball tournament also has another attractive selling point: It runs for three weeks in March and early April, a window in which most broadcasters are craving content. There is little else between the Super Bowl in mid-February and the Masters golf tournament and the start of the pro basketball and hockey playoffs in mid-April except the basketball tournaments. The rights for the men's tournament are owned by CBS and Turner.
"The women's basketball tournament is the top-rated event on ESPN between mid-February and mid-April," Desser said. "That matters, especially in a world where monthly subscriptions are increasingly in vogue. People didn't used to disconnect month to month, but now you have to have something that's competitive to stay in the decision set."
The upcoming negotiations will be different from those of a professional sports league, the increasingly professional nature of college sports notwithstanding.
The N.F.L., for example, might be expected to extract every last dollar from a deal. The N.C.A.A., even with Baker's insistence that the governing body must get better at increasing revenue, will have other considerations.
"It's a principle-based conversation," said Julie Roe Lach, the commissioner of the Horizon League and a member of the N.C.A.A. women's basketball oversight committee. "It can't just be monetary. It can't be as simple as which network is going to give the most money. There has to be a genuine commitment to grow the game."
In an era where athletes can make money from endorsements, she added, such growth might come in the way a broadcaster can help athletes reach a broader audience through mediums other than television.
Roe Lach is among those who believe that unbundling women's basketball would provide opportunities for other sports to grow on their own.
Perhaps the college baseball World Series might be attractive to the M.L.B. Network, or another network might get behind a niche sport the way the SEC Network has with its Friday night broadcasts of gymnastics that have heightened the sport's popularity in the South.
Julie Cromer, the athletic director at Ohio University and a co-chair of the committee that rewrote the N.C.A.A.'s constitution last year, believes Olympic sports are natural candidates to have their profiles elevated. She pointed to her time at Arkansas, where the university's indoor track and field team drew several thousand fans for its home meets, which prompted the university to livestream its events.
The N.C.A.A., she said, could act as an incubator.
"A lot of these sports have a dedicated fan base, and getting the product to that fan base doesn't always have to be accomplished through linear broadcasts," Cromer said.
One such sport would be lacrosse. Far down the sporting food chain, it has an anchor in the Northeast, but a decades-long push westward has been slow. When ESPN broadcast the men's and women's championships back to back on Memorial Day, it lent a big-time air to the event.
"Lacrosse has been searching for that for a long time," said Joe Spallina, the women's coach at Stony Brook University, whose regular-season game with top-ranked Syracuse was shown on ESPNU. "That's one of the problems with growing sports -- everyone wants to get to the top immediately."

Full text: Kyle Roche was a rising star in the field of cryptocurrency law -- until his career imploded. Who orchestrated his downfall?
When he arrived in London in late January 2022, Kyle Roche was riding high. At just 34 years old, he had established himself as one of the biggest players in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency litigation. He boasted a law firm bearing his name, lawsuits filed against more than a dozen crypto companies and a huge verdict against the man who claimed to have invented Bitcoin.
Now a new opportunity beckoned. Two businessmen had flown Mr. Roche over from Miami to discuss investing in a new business venture he was forming. A waiting car whisked him from Heathrow Airport to meet the men in a plush townhouse in Mayfair.
That evening, Mr. Roche went to dinner with one of the men, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. Mr. Villavicencio, who said he was from Argentina, had picked one of London's fanciest restaurants, Jean-Georges in the Connaught hotel.
When he woke up the next morning, Mr. Roche says, he felt groggy. He couldn't remember much aside from being pretty sure he had spotted Mr. Villavicencio's business partner, a Norwegian named Christen Ager-Hanssen, lurking at a nearby table. The brain fog was odd because he didn't think he'd had all that much to drink. As he flew back to Miami a few days later, Mr. Roche couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
Months passed. Then, one day last summer, Mr. Roche's world detonated. A website called Crypto Leaks posted two dozen videos of him that had been secretly recorded during his meetings with Mr. Villavicencio and Mr. Ager-Hanssen.
The videos portrayed Mr. Roche and his law firm, Roche Freedman, as being in the pocket of one of their crypto clients. In one clip, Mr. Roche revealed that the client, a company called Ava Labs, had granted him tens of millions of dollars' worth of its digital tokens, making him beholden to the company and its founder, whom he likened to a "brother."
In other clips, Mr. Roche made it sound like his sole concern, even when representing other clients, was to promote Ava Labs' interests. He bragged that he had managed to distract regulators from looking into Ava Labs and suggested that his lawsuits against other crypto companies were designed to harm Ava Labs' competitors.
In the videos filmed at Jean-Georges, Mr. Roche looked intoxicated, waving his hands, cursing and referring to jurors as "idiots."
After he got over his initial shock, Mr. Roche realized he had a major problem on his hands. The videos made him look corrupt. To defend himself, he published a piece on Medium saying they had been "illegally obtained" and "spliced out of context," and he denied being in cahoots with Ava Labs.
It was too late. One after another, companies that Roche Freedman had sued filed motions to disqualify the firm from their cases. In October, the first of those motions succeeded: A federal judge in New York tossed Roche Freedman from a case it had filed against Tether, the operator of the world's most used "stablecoin."
Within days, Mr. Roche was forced to resign from the law firm he had founded. With his career in tatters, he says, he enrolled in ethics classes and began to see a therapist.
Mr. Roche was felled by his own loose lips and his overly cozy relationship with a client. But he also was the victim of an elaborate international setup.
The question was: Who was behind it?
The New Sheriff
Mr. Roche grew up in a working-class family in Buffalo. The oldest of four siblings, he shared a bedroom with intellectually disabled twin brothers. Watching them struggle with simple tasks while he breezed through school made Mr. Roche feel both guilty and determined to succeed so he could one day provide for them.
After attending Purdue University and working for a few years as a management consultant, he enrolled at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law. During his first semester, in the fall of 2013, he caught the crypto bug. Joe Delich, a classmate who later worked with Mr. Roche at his law firm, remembers him constantly checking the price of Bitcoin on his laptop during classes. Mr. Roche cashed out before a big price drop, earning about $ 100,000 in profits. He used the money to pay his tuition.
As a third-year student, Mr. Roche collaborated with a professor on a paper discussing Bitcoin's virtues as the first currency free from government interference. That led to an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.
"That was the first moment I thought, 'Oh, wow, maybe I can do something with this,"' he said.
By then, Mr. Roche was a first-year associate at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was developing a reputation as the kid who understood crypto. When a colleague in Miami approached him a few days after the Journal piece with a Bitcoin-related case, he jumped at the opportunity.
The case pitted a man named Ira Kleiman against Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who claims to be Bitcoin's enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Kleiman wanted to sue Dr. Wright for defrauding his brother David, a paraplegic computer forensics expert who had died in his mid-40s, out of billions of dollars of Bitcoin they supposedly mined together in Bitcoin's early days.
The facts were murky: There was evidence that Dr. Wright and David Kleiman had indeed been friends, and David Kleiman had been known to carry around his neck an encrypted hard drive that might or might not have contained the passwords to Bitcoin wallets. But many people considered Dr. Wright a fraud, calling into question the notion that he had mined early blocks of Bitcoin, much less cheated someone out of them.
To Mr. Roche, that was one of the allures of the case. If he could make Dr. Wright hand over his files during discovery, he might be able to solve Bitcoin's great enduring mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity. Mr. Roche and his young Miami colleague, Velvel Freedman, were soon devoting most of their time to the case.
In 2019, with the Kleiman case slowly progressing toward a trial, Mr. Roche met a new client, who was locked in a dispute with a crypto company. In a matter of days, he negotiated a lucrative settlement on the client's behalf. As a token of his gratitude, the client agreed to invest $ 7.5 million with Mr. Roche and Mr. Freedman so they could start their own law firm. At first, Mr. Roche set up shop in a co-working space in Brooklyn, but when the pandemic hit he joined Mr. Freedman in Miami.
Their firm, Roche Freedman, soon made a splash. Mr. Roche had watched with increasing skepticism as a number of crypto start-ups rode Bitcoin's growing popularity by marketing new digital coins that surged in value and then crashed. It reminded him of pump-and-dump scams in which a group inflates the price of a stock by talking it up publicly before selling all at once and making off with the profits.
Regulators didn't seem to be doing anything about it, so Mr. Roche decided he would. On April 3, 2020, Roche Freedman filed lawsuits seeking class action status against seven issuers of digital coins, alleging they had pumped what amounted to unregistered securities with false statements and then dumped them, leaving retail investors holding the bag.
It also sued four crypto exchanges for enabling the coin issuers' conduct, foreshadowing some of the legal arguments the Securities and Exchange Commission used to sue Binance and Coinbase this month. (Binance and Coinbase have vowed to fight the S.E.C. in court.)
Those suits were just an opening salvo: Sixteen months later, Mr. Roche filed his biggest securities fraud case yet. It alleged that a British entrepreneur, Dominic Williams, and entities he controlled had swindled investors out of billions of dollars by aggressively promoting, and then dumping, a digital coin tied to a grandiose plan to revolutionize computing.
Mr. Williams had boldly proclaimed that his Internet Computer blockchain -- a decentralized network of computers powered by a digital token called ICP -- would supplant the big cloud services offered by Amazon and Microsoft and become humanity's primary computing platform. But after an initial surge that briefly made it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICP had plummeted 92 percent -- a collapse that Mr. Roche's lawsuit attributed to "massive" selling by Mr. Williams and other insiders. (Mr. Williams denied the allegations.)
If crypto was the Wild West of finance, Mr. Roche had announced himself as the new sheriff. But sheriffs, as he would soon learn, make enemies.
A Big Verdict
Around the time Mr. Roche was working on his first pump-and-dump lawsuits, he befriended Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who was hatching a cryptocurrency project of his own in the Brooklyn co-working space where Mr. Roche initially worked. Mr. Roche agreed to do legal work for Dr. Sirer's company, Ava Labs, in exchange for an equity stake and a small percentage of the cryptocurrency tokens it planned to issue.
Such arrangements aren't uncommon in the tech industry. Mr. Roche's former boss David Boies had struck a similar one with Theranos, the blood-testing company whose founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was later convicted of fraud. The scandals involving Theranos and another client, Harvey Weinstein, had badly tarnished Mr. Boies's reputation, but to Mr. Roche he remained a role model.
When Mr. Roche reached his deal with Dr. Sirer in September 2019, he says, there was no guarantee that Dr. Sirer's project would be successful. At the time, the tokens granted to him were valued at less than 3 cents each.
A year later, Dr. Sirer's blockchain, Avalanche, went live. As crypto fever spread, its AVAX tokens rocketed to more than $ 100, making Mr. Roche a multimillionaire.
Mr. Roche's compensation agreement with Ava Labs was supposed to be confidential, but anyone who wanted to gather intel on him would soon be able to find out about it. In February 2021, Roche Freedman fired one of its partners, Jason Cyrulnik. He hit back with a lawsuit that disclosed each partner's share of the AVAX tokens.
That fall, Kleiman v. Wright went to trial in U.S. District Court in Miami. Mr. Roche gave a fiery opening statement during which he repeatedly pointed an accusatory finger at Dr. Wright.
In the end, the trial didn't resolve whether Dr. Wright had really invented Bitcoin, but the jury ordered him to pay $ 100 million in damages to a company Ira Kleiman had inherited from his dead brother. (The judge later tacked on $ 43 million in interest.) Mr. Roche and Mr. Freedman toasted over cocktails at a Miami restaurant. Their law firm stood to make more than $ 10 million.
With the Kleiman trial over, Mr. Roche turned to a project he and Dr. Sirer had been discussing: Ryval, a company that would help people raise money on Avalanche to pay for lawsuits. Mr. Roche saw it as a GoFundMe for litigation and thought it could level the legal playing field between individuals and big corporations.
But while he was plotting his new venture, someone was plotting his downfall.
The Setup
In December 2021, Mr. Roche received an email from someone he trusted introducing him to Mr. Villavicencio, according to a copy of the message reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Villavicencio presented himself as an associate of Mr. Ager-Hanssen, a venture capitalist who was interested in Mr. Roche's new project. Mr. Roche had no idea who the two men were, but he welcomed the approach: He was raising money for Ryval, which had received some attention in the crypto press.
After an introductory Zoom call, Mr. Roche agreed to fly to London at the men's expense the next month.
They met at Mr. Ager-Hanssen's townhouse office, where things soon took a strange turn: According to Mr. Roche, Mr. Ager-Hanssen pressed his index finger to Mr. Roche's forehead -- "I didn't think it was a gun motion, but I thought he was trying to intimidate me" -- and said that if he was going to invest with him, he needed to know everything Mr. Roche was capable of.
In hindsight, Mr. Roche wishes he had gotten up and left. Instead, he took it as a cue to sell himself harder. According to Mr. Roche, Mr. Ager-Hanssen spent the next couple of hours goading him into bragging about his relationship with Ava Labs while Mr. Villavicencio, who was sitting across a table from him, secretly filmed him.
Armed with the information he had gleaned from the lawsuit filed by the fired Roche Freedman partner, Mr. Ager-Hanssen coaxed Mr. Roche into saying he had been granted 1 percent of the supply of Avalanche's AVAX tokens. At the time, that would have been equivalent to more than $ 100 million. (Mr. Roche says he exaggerated the 1 percent figure, and AVAX tokens have since lost 80 percent of their value.)
Mr. Ager-Hanssen then asked Mr. Roche to give examples of how he had made himself useful to Ava Labs executives.
"They haven't been sued yet, and there's a reason for that," said the baby-faced Mr. Roche, wearing a blazer over a button-down shirt and sweater, according to a video clip from the meeting.
"Brilliant," Mr. Ager-Hanssen replied. "Good answer."
Mr. Roche later elaborated. "I deal with making sure that the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. have other magnets to go after," he said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He added, "Litigation can be a tool" to attack competition. "It's a fantastic tool."
That night, when Mr. Roche got to Jean-Georges, he says, he found Mr. Villavicencio at a table and a drink waiting for him. Mr. Roche recalls Mr. Ager-Hanssen arriving about 15 minutes later and sitting at a nearby table with a tall blond man. Mr. Roche says the rest of the evening was a blur. He now believes the drink was laced with a drug, though he has no proof.
In one video clip from the restaurant, Mr. Roche revels in his power to crush companies with lawsuits. In another, Mr. Villavicencio asks him whether Ava Labs has sued any of its competitors. Mr. Roche replies, "No, they have me do that on behalf of the class," suggesting that he filed his class actions against other crypto companies at Ava Labs' behest.
After the dinner at Jean-Georges, Mr. Roche never saw Mr. Villavicencio again, though he did meet one last time with Mr. Ager-Hanssen in New York.
On Aug. 26, Mr. Roche was in California to attend a wedding when one of his clients came across the Crypto Leaks videos on Twitter and sent him a link.
Blindsided, he scrambled to understand when and where they had been recorded. Once he pieced it together, he called Mr. Freedman and reached out to clients to do damage control.
Mr. Roche's biggest worry was his comments suggesting he had filed lawsuits to harm Ava Labs' competitors and to distract regulators. It was baseless bluster, he now says, blaming the blue-collar kid in him who was trying to impress a prospective investor. He says he started putting together the first lawsuits a month before he met Dr. Sirer, the Ava Labs founder.
Dr. Sirer denied that he or Ava Labs had anything to do with those lawsuits, some of which he said he strongly disagreed with. Six weeks before Crypto Leaks published its videos, Ava Labs' general counsel wrote an article criticizing one of the Roche Freedman lawsuits as "scurrilous."
To insulate his law firm, Mr. Roche recused himself from the lawsuits Roche Freedman had filed against crypto companies, sold his stake in Ava Labs back to the company and stopped representing it. (Mr. Roche declined to say whether he profited on the sale.)
When it became clear that wouldn't be enough, he resigned from his firm, which was renamed Freedman Normand Friedland.
'Someone That Doesn't Exist'
A week after the videos surfaced, Mr. Roche got another jolt: A friend of one of his colleagues reported that he had heard rumors at a crypto event that Mr. Roche's life was in danger, according to an affidavit later filed in court. Spooked, Mr. Roche and his fiancée hunkered down in a short-term rental in Brooklyn.
Mr. Roche felt that his world was unraveling. He says he became so stressed that he stopped eating and lost 10 pounds. After several weeks, he and his fiancée returned to Miami but, still worried for their safety, moved to an apartment leased under a relative's name.
While Mr. Roche's career imploded, Mr. Ager-Hanssen called for Mr. Roche's disbarment and tweeted about a report he had compiled on Mr. Roche that largely repeated the Crypto Leaks allegations. He also emailed Mr. Cyrulnik, the former Roche Freedman partner, and offered to help him prove his case against Mr. Roche and his former firm.
To Mr. Roche, the implication was clear: Mr. Ager-Hanssen had set him up.
In an interview, Mr. Ager-Hanssen denied that. "This was not an operation run by me at all," he said. "It was run by someone else." He said that he had been genuinely interested in investing in Ryval, that Mr. Villavicencio had filmed the videos at his office without his knowledge and that he wasn't at Jean-Georges that night. Mr. Ager-Hanssen said he thought he knew who was behind the operation, but he wouldn't reveal the person's identity.
Mr. Villavicencio, for his part, seems to have disappeared. Attempts to reach him at the phone number and email address he gave Mr. Roche were unsuccessful.
Mr. Ager-Hanssen said he didn't know Mr. Villavicencio's whereabouts. He said he had met the man only a few weeks before Mr. Roche came to London and allowed that Villavicencio was probably not his real name. "Of course, it's someone that doesn't exist," he said.
But Mr. Ager-Hanssen, in addition to running his venture capital firm, has long had a sideline digging up dirt on behalf of wealthy clients entangled in business disputes in Britain and Scandinavia.
On multiple occasions, he has secretly recorded his targets. For example, in a 2014 interview, he recounted how he had snared the adversary of a Swedish financier with a hidden microphone and boasted that he employed former intelligence officers from the C.I.A., MI6 and Mossad.
But if Mr. Ager-Hanssen did set Mr. Roche up, who hired him to do it -- and why?
A Series of Clues
Plenty of people had reason to celebrate Mr. Roche's downfall.
First in line were Dr. Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and Calvin Ayre, a gambling tycoon who bankrolls Dr. Wright. Dr. Wright quickly sought to exploit the videos, filing an unsuccessful motion to disqualify Roche Freedman from the Kleiman case. And after the videos came out, Mr. Ager-Hanssen became chief executive of nChain, a company that Mr. Ayre funds and that employs Dr. Wright as chief science officer.
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Ayre acknowledged that he and Dr. Wright were "pleased" when the videos came out. But they denied having anything to do with the London sting.
Mr. Roche believes them because he thinks he knows who hired Mr. Ager-Hanssen: Mr. Williams, the British entrepreneur who was the target of Roche Freedman's biggest pump-and-dump lawsuit.
A series of clues, documented by his former law firm in court filings, led Mr. Roche to that conclusion. The first is that on May 12, 2022, Mr. Williams wrote on Twitter that he was "coming for" his critics. That was the same day the cryptoleaks.info domain name was registered.
Then, on June 9, 2022, the Crypto Leaks website went live. Billing itself as the defender of "the honest crypto community," it posted two reports that aligned with Mr. Williams's interests. The first espoused a complicated theory about the ICP token crash that Mr. Williams had previously floated on Twitter.
The second attacked The Times for an article it had published about the crash. Mr. Williams tweeted a link to that Crypto Leaks report, calling it "Gobsmacking." The Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit that Mr. Williams created to oversee his blockchain, has since sued The Times for defamation in New York. The Times is seeking to dismiss the suit.
The videos of Mr. Roche were the crux of Crypto Leaks' third exposé. After they were published, Mr. Williams and Dfinity filed a motion to disqualify Roche Freedman as plaintiffs' counsel in the pump-and-dump lawsuit, saying Mr. Roche's comments demonstrated "a disregard for the integrity of the judicial system."
In court filings opposing the motion, Mr. Roche's former firm accused Mr. Williams of being behind Crypto Leaks and said the videos filmed at Jean-Georges showed signs of deepfake alterations. It also blamed Mr. Williams for the rumored death threats against Mr. Roche.
Pete Padovano, a spokesman for Dfinity and Mr. Williams, denied that anyone at the foundation had made death threats. Asked if he was connected to Crypto Leaks, Mr. Williams said, "We appreciate the coverage of Crypto Leaks and believe their articles speak for themselves."
Mr. Roche spent last fall lying low, but he has recently begun to rebuild his career as a solo practitioner.
In April, he won a $ 12.5 million verdict on behalf of six former Cantor Fitzgerald partners who sued the Wall Street firm for withholding some of their compensation. The judgment, which Cantor has appealed, opened the way for Mr. Roche to file a separate class action against the firm. Mr. Roche is also representing dozens of investors in a dispute with Coinbase.
But Mr. Roche's videotaped remarks continue to dog him and his former firm. Last month, the judge overseeing the pump-and-dump case granted Mr. Williams's motion and disqualified Freedman Normand Friedland as plaintiffs' counsel.
The judge cited Mr. Freedman's continuing friendship with Mr. Roche -- and the fact that they together control a cryptocurrency wallet holding more than a million AVAX tokens. He also voiced concern that the law firm was consumed by "extreme animosity" toward Mr. Williams, which might lead it to turn down equitable settlement offers.
Unless the lead plaintiff can enlist new lawyers by August, the lawsuit is essentially dead. In Mr. Roche's view, the plot against him worked to perfection.

Why It Seems Everything We Knew About the Global Economy Is No Longer True

LONDON — When the world’s business and political leaders gathered in 2018 at the annual economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, the mood was jubilant. Growth in every major country was on an upswing. The global economy, declared Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, “is in a very sweet spot.”
Five years later, the outlook has decidedly soured.
“Nearly all the economic forces that powered progress and prosperity over the last three decades are fading,” the World Bank warned in a recent analysis. “The result could be a lost decade in the making — not just for some countries or regions as has occurred in the past — but for the whole world.”
A lot has happened between then and now: A pandemic hit; war erupted in Europe; tensions between the United States and China boiled. And inflation, thought to be safely stored away with disco album collections, returned with a vengeance.
But as the dust has settled, it has suddenly seemed as if almost everything we thought we knew about the world economy was wrong.
The economic conventions that policymakers had relied on since the Berlin Wall fell more than 30 years ago — the unfailing superiority of open markets, liberalized trade and maximum efficiency — look to be running off the rails.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceaseless drive to integrate the global economy and reduce costs left health care workers without face masks and medical gloves, carmakers without semiconductors, sawmills without lumber and sneaker-buyers without Nikes.
The idea that trade and shared economic interests would prevent military conflicts was trampled last year under the boots of Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
And increasing bouts of extreme weather that destroyed crops, forced migrations and halted power plants have illustrated that the market’s invisible hand was not protecting the planet.
Now, as the second year of war in Ukraine grinds on and countries struggle with limp growth and persistent inflation, questions about the emerging economic playing field have taken center stage.
Globalization, seen in recent decades as unstoppable a force as gravity, is clearly evolving in unpredictable ways. The move away from an integrated world economy is accelerating. And the best way to respond is a subject of fierce debate.
Of course, challenges to the reigning economic consensus had been growing for a while.
“We saw before the pandemic began that the wealthiest countries were getting frustrated by international trade, believing — whether correctly or not — that somehow this was hurting them, their jobs and standards of living,” said Betsey Stevenson, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration.
The financial meltdown in 2008 came close to tanking the global financial system. Britain pulled out of the European Union in 2016. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on China in 2017, spurring a mini trade war.
But starting with COVID, the rat-a-tat series of crises exposed with startling clarity vulnerabilities that demanded attention.
As the consulting firm EY concluded in its 2023 Geostrategic Outlook, the trends behind the shift away from ever-increasing globalization “were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic — and then they have been supercharged by the war in Ukraine.”
‘The End of History’
Today’s sense of unease is a stark contrast with the heady triumphalism that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. It was a period when a theorist could declare that the fall of communism marked “the end of history” — that liberal democratic ideas not only vanquished rivals but represented “the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution.”
Associated economic theories about the ineluctable rise of worldwide free-market capitalism took on a similar sheen of invincibility and inevitability. Open markets, hands-off government and the relentless pursuit of efficiency would offer the best route to prosperity.
It was believed that a new world where goods, money and information crisscrossed the globe would essentially sweep away the old order of Cold War conflicts and undemocratic regimes.
There was reason for optimism. During the 1990s, inflation was low while employment, wages and productivity were up. Global trade nearly doubled. Investments in developing countries surged. The stock market rose.
The World Trade Organization was established in 1995 to enforce the rules. China’s entry six years later was seen as transformative. And linking a huge market with 142 countries would irresistibly draw the Asian giant toward democracy.
China, along with South Korea, Malaysia and others, turned struggling farmers into productive urban factory workers. The furniture, toys and electronics they sold around the world generated tremendous growth.
The favored economic road map helped produce fabulous wealth, lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and spur wondrous technological advances.
But there were stunning failures as well. Globalization hastened climate change and deepened inequalities.
In the United States and other advanced economies, many industrial jobs were exported to lower-wage countries, removing a springboard to the middle class.
Policymakers always knew there would be winners and losers. Still, the market was left to decide how to deploy labor, technology and capital in the belief that efficiency and growth would automatically follow. Only afterward, the thinking went, should politicians step in to redistribute gains or help those left without jobs or prospects.
Companies embarked on a worldwide scavenger hunt for low-wage workers, regardless of worker protections, environmental impact or democratic rights. They found many of them in places such as Mexico, Vietnam and China.
Televisions, T-shirts and tacos were cheaper than ever, but many essentials such as health care, housing and higher education were increasingly out of reach.
The job exodus pushed down wages at home and undercut workers’ bargaining power, spurring anti-immigrant sentiments and strengthening hard-right populist leaders such as Trump in the United States, Viktor Orban in Hungary and Marine Le Pen in France.
In advanced industrial giants such as the United States, Britain and several European countries, political leaders turned out to be unable or unwilling to more broadly reapportion rewards and burdens.
Nor were they able to prevent damaging environmental fallout. Transporting goods around the globe increased greenhouse gas emissions. Producing for a world of consumers strained natural resources, encouraging overfishing in Southeast Asia and illegal deforestation in Brazil. And cheap production facilities polluted countries without adequate environmental standards.
It turned out that markets on their own weren’t able to automatically distribute gains fairly or spur developing countries to grow or establish democratic institutions.
Jake Sullivan, U.S. national security adviser, said in a recent speech that a central fallacy in American economic policy had been to assume “that markets always allocate capital productively and efficiently — no matter what our competitors did, no matter how big our shared challenges grew and no matter how many guardrails we took down.”
The proliferation of economic exchanges among nations also failed to usher in a promised democratic renaissance.
Communist-led China turned out to be the global economic system’s biggest beneficiary — and perhaps master gamesman — without embracing democratic values.
“Capitalist tools in socialist hands,” Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said in 1992, when his country was developing into the world’s factory floor. China’s astonishing growth transformed it into the world’s second-largest economy and a major engine of global growth. All along, though, Beijing maintained a tight grip on its raw materials, land, capital, energy, credit and labor, as well as the movements and speech of its people.
Poor Countries Paid Price
In developing countries, the results could be dire.
The economic havoc wreaked by the pandemic combined with soaring food and fuel prices caused by the war in Ukraine have created a spate of debt crises. Rising interest rates have made those crises worse. Debts, such as energy and food, are often priced in dollars on the world market, so when U.S. rates go up, debt payments get more expensive.
The cycle of loans and bailouts, though, has deeper roots.
Poorer nations were pressured to lift all restrictions on capital moving in and out of the country. The argument was that money, like goods, should flow freely among nations. Allowing governments, businesses and individuals to borrow from foreign lenders would finance industrial development and key infrastructure.
“Financial globalization was supposed to usher in an era of robust growth and fiscal stability in the developing world,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. But, she said, “it ended up doing the opposite.”
Some loans — whether from private lenders or institutions such as the World Bank — didn’t produce enough returns to pay off the debt. Others were poured into speculative schemes, half-baked proposals, vanity projects or corrupt officials’ bank accounts. And debtors remained at the mercy of rising interest rates that swelled the size of debt payments in a heartbeat.
Over the years, reckless lending, asset bubbles, currency fluctuations and official mismanagement led to boom-and-bust cycles in Asia, Russia, Latin America and elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, extravagant projects undertaken by the government, from ports to cricket stadiums, helped drive the country into bankruptcy last year as citizens scavenged for food and the central bank, in a barter arrangement, paid for Iranian oil with tea leaves.
It’s a “Ponzi scheme,” Ghosh said.
Private lenders who got spooked that they would not be repaid cut off the flow of money, leaving countries in the lurch.
And the mandated austerity that accompanied bailouts from the IMF, which compelled overextended governments to slash spending, often brought widespread misery by cutting public assistance, pensions, education and health care.
Even IMF economists acknowledged in 2016 that instead of delivering growth, such policies “increased inequality, in turn jeopardizing durable expansion.”
Disenchantment with the West’s style of lending gave China the opportunity to become an aggressive creditor in countries such as Argentina, Mongolia, Egypt and Suriname.
Return to Self-Reliance
Although the collapse of the Soviet Union cleared the way for the domination of free-market orthodoxy, the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has now decisively unmoored it.
The story of the international economy today, said Henry Farrell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is about “how geopolitics is gobbling up hyperglobalization.”
Old-world-style great power politics accomplished what the threat of catastrophic climate collapse, seething social unrest and widening inequality could not: It upended assumptions about the global economic order.
Josep Borrell, the EU’s head of foreign affairs and security policy, put it bluntly in a speech 10 months after the invasion of Ukraine: “We have decoupled the sources of our prosperity from the sources of our security.” Europe got cheap energy from Russia and cheap manufactured goods from China. “This is a world that is no longer there,” he said.
Supply chain chokeholds stemming from the pandemic and subsequent recovery had already underscored the fragility of a globally sourced economy. As political tensions over the war grew, policymakers quickly added self-reliance and strength to the goals of growth and efficiency.
“Our supply chains are not secure, and they’re not resilient,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last spring. Trade relationships should be built around “trusted partners,” she said, even if it means “a somewhat higher level of cost, a somewhat less efficient system.”
“It was naive to think that markets are just about efficiency and that they’re not also about power,” said Abraham Newman, co-author with Farrell of “Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy.”
Economic networks, by their very nature, create power imbalances and pressure points because countries have varying capabilities and vulnerabilities.
Russia, which had supplied 40% of the EU’s natural gas, tried to use that dependency to pressure the bloc to withdraw its support of Ukraine.
The United States and its allies used their domination of the global financial system to remove major Russian banks from the international payments system.
China has retaliated against trading partners by restricting access to its enormous market.
The extreme concentrations of critical suppliers and information technology networks has generated additional chokepoints.
China manufactures 80% of the world’s solar panels. Taiwan produces 92% of tiny advanced semiconductors. Much of the world’s trade and transactions are figured in U.S. dollars.
The new reality is reflected in American policy. The United States — the central architect of the liberalized economic order and the WTO — has turned away from more comprehensive free-trade agreements and repeatedly refused to abide by WTO decisions.
Security concerns have led the Biden administration to block Chinese investment in American businesses and limit China’s access to private data on citizens and to new technologies.
And it has embraced Chinese-style industrial policy, offering gargantuan subsidies for electric vehicles, batteries, wind farms, solar plants and more to secure supply chains and speed the transition to renewable energy.
“Ignoring the economic dependencies that had built up over the decades of liberalization had become really perilous,” said Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser. Adherence to “oversimplified market efficiency,” he added, proved to be a mistake.
Although the previous economic orthodoxy has been partly abandoned, it is not clear what will replace it. Improvisation is the order of the day. Perhaps the only assumption that can be confidently relied on now is that the path to prosperity and policy trade-offs will become murkier.

When he arrived in London in late January 2022, Kyle Roche was riding high. Just 34, he had established himself as one of the biggest players in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency litigation. He boasted a law firm bearing his name, lawsuits filed against more than a dozen crypto companies and a huge verdict against the man who claimed to have invented bitcoin.
Now a new opportunity beckoned. Two businessmen had flown Roche over from Miami to discuss investing in a business venture he was forming. A waiting car whisked him from Heathrow Airport to meet the men in a plush town house in Mayfair.
That evening, Roche went to dinner with one of the men, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. Villavicencio, who said he was from Argentina, had picked one of London’s fanciest restaurants, Jean-Georges in the Connaught hotel.
When he woke up the next morning, Roche said, he felt groggy. He couldn’t remember much aside from being pretty sure he had spotted Villavicencio’s business partner, a Norwegian named Christen Ager-Hanssen, lurking at a nearby table. The brain fog was odd because he didn’t think he’d had all that much to drink. As he flew back to Miami a few days later, Roche couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss.
Months passed. Then, one day last summer, Roche’s world detonated. A website called Crypto Leaks posted two dozen videos of him that had been secretly recorded during his meetings with Villavicencio and Ager-Hanssen.
The videos portrayed Roche and his law firm, Roche Freedman, as being in the pocket of one of their crypto clients. In one clip, Roche revealed that the client, a company called Ava Labs, had granted him tens of millions of dollars’ worth of its digital tokens, making him beholden to the company and its founder, whom he likened to a “brother.”
In other clips, Roche made it sound like his sole concern, even when representing other clients, was to promote Ava Labs’ interests. He bragged that he had managed to distract regulators from looking into Ava Labs and suggested that his lawsuits against other crypto companies were designed to harm Ava Labs’ competitors.
In the videos filmed at Jean-Georges, Roche looked intoxicated, waving his hands, cursing and referring to jurors as “idiots.”
After he got over his initial shock, Roche realized he had a major problem on his hands. The videos made him look corrupt. To defend himself, he published a piece on Medium saying they had been “illegally obtained” and “spliced out of context,” and he denied being in cahoots with Ava Labs.
It was too late. One after another, companies that Roche Freedman had sued filed motions to disqualify the firm from their cases. In October, the first of those motions succeeded: A federal judge in New York tossed Roche Freedman from a case it had filed against Tether, the operator of the world’s most used “stablecoin.”
Within days, Roche was forced to resign from the law firm he had founded. With his career in tatters, he said, he enrolled in ethics classes and began to see a therapist.
Roche was felled by his own loose lips and his overly cozy relationship with a client. But he also was the victim of an elaborate international setup.
The question was: Who was behind it?
The New Sheriff
Roche grew up in a working-class family in Buffalo, New York. The oldest of four siblings, he shared a bedroom with intellectually disabled twin brothers. Watching them struggle with simple tasks while he breezed through school made Roche feel both guilty and determined to succeed so he could one day provide for them.
After attending Purdue University and working for a few years as a management consultant, he enrolled at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law. During his first semester, in the fall of 2013, he caught the crypto bug. Joe Delich, a classmate who later worked with Roche at his law firm, remembers him constantly checking the price of bitcoin on his laptop during classes. Roche cashed out before a big price drop, earning about $100,000 in profits. He used the money to pay his tuition.
As a third-year student, Roche collaborated with a professor on a paper discussing bitcoin’s virtues as the first currency free from government interference. That led to an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.
“That was the first moment I thought, ‘Oh, wow, maybe I can do something with this,’” he said.
By then, Roche was a first-year associate at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was developing a reputation as the kid who understood crypto. When a colleague in Miami approached him a few days after the Journal piece with a bitcoin-related case, he jumped at the opportunity.
The case pitted a man named Ira Kleiman against Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who claims to be bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Kleiman wanted to sue Wright for defrauding his brother David, a paraplegic computer forensics expert who had died in his mid-40s, out of billions of dollars of bitcoin they supposedly mined together in bitcoin’s early days.
The facts were murky: There was evidence that Wright and David Kleiman had indeed been friends, and David Kleiman had been known to carry around his neck an encrypted hard drive that might or might not have contained the passwords to bitcoin wallets. But many people considered Wright a fraud, calling into question the notion that he had mined early blocks of bitcoin, much less cheated someone out of them.
To Roche, that was one of the allures of the case. If he could make Wright hand over his files during discovery, he might be able to solve bitcoin’s great enduring mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity. Roche and his young Miami colleague, Velvel Freedman, were soon devoting most of their time to the case.
In 2019, with the Kleiman case slowly progressing toward a trial, Roche met a new client who was locked in a dispute with a crypto company. In a matter of days, he negotiated a lucrative settlement on the client’s behalf. As a token of his gratitude, the client agreed to invest $7.5 million with Roche and Freedman so they could start their own law firm. At first, Roche set up shop in a coworking space in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, but when the pandemic hit he joined Freedman in Miami.
Their firm, Roche Freedman, soon made a splash. Roche had watched with increasing skepticism as a number of crypto startups rode bitcoin’s growing popularity by marketing new digital coins that surged in value and then crashed. It reminded him of pump-and-dump scams in which a group inflates the price of a stock by talking it up publicly before selling all at once and making off with the profits.
Regulators didn’t seem to be doing anything about it, so Roche decided he would. On April 3, 2020, Roche Freedman filed lawsuits seeking class-action status against seven issuers of digital coins, alleging they had pumped what amounted to unregistered securities with false statements and then dumped them, leaving retail investors holding the bag.
It also sued four crypto exchanges for enabling the coin issuers’ conduct, foreshadowing some of the legal arguments the Securities and Exchange Commission used to sue Binance and Coinbase this month. (Binance and Coinbase have vowed to fight the SEC in court.)
Those suits were just an opening salvo: Sixteen months later, Roche filed his biggest securities fraud case yet. It alleged that a British entrepreneur, Dominic Williams, and entities he controlled had swindled investors out of billions of dollars by aggressively promoting, and then dumping, a digital coin tied to a grandiose plan to revolutionize computing.
Williams had boldly proclaimed that his Internet Computer blockchain — a decentralized network of computers powered by a digital token called ICP — would supplant the big cloud services offered by Amazon and Microsoft and become humanity’s primary computing platform. But after an initial surge that briefly made it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICP had plummeted 92% — a collapse that Roche’s lawsuit attributed to “massive” selling by Williams and other insiders. (Williams denied the allegations.)
If crypto was the Wild West of finance, Roche had announced himself as the new sheriff. But sheriffs, as he would soon learn, make enemies.
A Big Verdict
Around the time Roche was working on his first pump-and-dump lawsuits, he befriended Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who was hatching a cryptocurrency project of his own in the Brooklyn coworking space where Roche initially worked. Roche agreed to do legal work for Sirer’s company, Ava Labs, in exchange for an equity stake and a small percentage of the cryptocurrency tokens it planned to issue.
Such arrangements aren’t uncommon in the tech industry. Roche’s former boss David Boies had struck a similar one with Theranos, the blood-testing company whose founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was later convicted of fraud. The scandals involving Theranos and another client, Harvey Weinstein, had badly tarnished Boies’ reputation, but to Roche he remained a role model.
When Roche reached his deal with Sirer in September 2019, he said, there was no guarantee that Sirer’s project would be successful. At the time, the tokens granted to him were valued at less than 3 cents each.
A year later, Sirer’s blockchain, Avalanche, went live. As crypto fever spread, its AVAX tokens rocketed to more than $100, making Roche a multimillionaire.
Roche’s compensation agreement with Ava Labs was supposed to be confidential, but anyone who wanted to gather intel on him would soon be able to find out about it. In February 2021, Roche Freedman fired one of its partners, Jason Cyrulnik. He hit back with a lawsuit that disclosed each partner’s share of the AVAX tokens.
That fall, Kleiman v. Wright went to trial in U.S. District Court in Miami. Roche gave a fiery opening statement during which he repeatedly pointed an accusatory finger at Wright.
In the end, the trial didn’t resolve whether Wright had really invented bitcoin, but the jury ordered him to pay $100 million in damages to a company Ira Kleiman had inherited from his dead brother. (The judge later tacked on $43 million in interest.) Roche and Freedman toasted over cocktails at a Miami restaurant. Their law firm stood to make more than $10 million.
With the Kleiman trial over, Roche turned to a project he and Sirer had been discussing: Ryval, a company that would help people raise money on Avalanche to pay for lawsuits. Roche saw it as a GoFundMe for litigation and thought it could level the legal playing field between individuals and big corporations.
But while he was plotting his new venture, someone was plotting his downfall.
The Setup
In December 2021, Roche received an email from someone he trusted introducing him to Villavicencio, according to a copy of the message reviewed by The New York Times. Villavicencio presented himself as an associate of Ager-Hanssen, a venture capitalist who was interested in Roche’s new project. Roche had no idea who the two men were, but he welcomed the approach: He was raising money for Ryval, which had received some attention in the crypto press.
After an introductory Zoom call, Roche agreed to fly to London at the men’s expense the next month.
They met at Ager-Hanssen’s town house office, where things soon took a strange turn: According to Roche, Ager-Hanssen pressed his index finger to Roche’s forehead — “I didn’t think it was a gun motion, but I thought he was trying to intimidate me” — and said that if he was going to invest with him, he needed to know everything Roche was capable of.
In hindsight, Roche wishes he had gotten up and left. Instead, he took it as a cue to sell himself harder. According to Roche, Ager-Hanssen spent the next couple of hours goading him into bragging about his relationship with Ava Labs while Villavicencio, who was sitting across a table from him, secretly filmed him.
Armed with the information he had gleaned from the lawsuit filed by the fired Roche Freedman partner, Ager-Hanssen coaxed Roche into saying he had been granted 1% of the supply of Avalanche’s AVAX tokens. At the time, that would have been equivalent to more than $100 million. (Roche says he exaggerated the 1% figure, and AVAX tokens have since lost 80% of their value.)
Ager-Hanssen then asked Roche to give examples of how he had made himself useful to Ava Labs executives.
“They haven’t been sued yet, and there’s a reason for that,” said the baby-faced Roche, wearing a blazer over a button-down shirt and sweater, according to a video clip from the meeting.
“Brilliant,” Ager-Hanssen replied. “Good answer.”
Roche later elaborated. “I deal with making sure that the SEC and the CFTC have other magnets to go after,” he said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He added, “Litigation can be a tool” to attack competition. “It’s a fantastic tool.”
That night, when Roche got to Jean-Georges, he said, he found Villavicencio at a table and a drink waiting for him. Roche recalls Ager-Hanssen arriving about 15 minutes later and sitting at a nearby table with a tall blond man. Roche said the rest of the evening was a blur. He now believes the drink was laced with a drug, though he has no proof.
In one video clip from the restaurant, Roche revels in his power to crush companies with lawsuits. In another, Villavicencio asks him whether Ava Labs has sued any of its competitors. Roche replies, “No, they have me do that on behalf of the class,” suggesting that he filed his class actions against other crypto companies at Ava Labs’ behest.
After the dinner at Jean-Georges, Roche never saw Villavicencio again, though he did meet one last time with Ager-Hanssen in New York.
On Aug. 26, Roche was in California to attend a wedding when one of his clients came across the Crypto Leaks videos on Twitter and sent him a link.
Blindsided, he scrambled to understand when and where they had been recorded. Once he pieced it together, he called Freedman and reached out to clients to do damage control.
Roche’s biggest worry was his comments suggesting he had filed lawsuits to harm Ava Labs’ competitors and to distract regulators. It was baseless bluster, he now says, blaming the blue-collar kid in him who was trying to impress a prospective investor. He said he started putting together the first lawsuits a month before he met Sirer, the Ava Labs founder.
Sirer denied that he or Ava Labs had anything to do with those lawsuits, some of which he said he strongly disagreed with. Six weeks before Crypto Leaks published its videos, Ava Labs’ general counsel wrote an article criticizing one of the Roche Freedman lawsuits as “scurrilous.”
To insulate his law firm, Roche recused himself from the lawsuits Roche Freedman had filed against crypto companies, sold his stake in Ava Labs back to the company and stopped representing it. (Roche declined to say whether he profited on the sale.)
When it became clear that wouldn’t be enough, he resigned from his firm, which was renamed Freedman Normand Friedland.
‘Someone That Doesn’t Exist’
A week after the videos surfaced, Roche got another jolt: A friend of a colleague said he had heard rumors at a crypto event that Roche’s life was in danger, according to an affidavit later filed in court. Spooked, Roche and his fiancée hunkered down in a short-term rental in Brooklyn.
Roche felt that his world was unraveling. He says he became so stressed that he stopped eating and lost 10 pounds. After several weeks, he and his fiancée returned to Miami but, still worried for their safety, moved to an apartment leased under a relative’s name.
While Roche’s career imploded, Ager-Hanssen called for Roche’s disbarment and tweeted about a report he had compiled on Roche that largely repeated the Crypto Leaks allegations. He also emailed Cyrulnik, the former Roche Freedman partner, and offered to help him prove his case against Roche and his former firm.
To Roche, the implication was clear: Ager-Hanssen had set him up.
In an interview, Ager-Hanssen denied that. “This was not an operation run by me at all,” he said. “It was run by someone else.” He said that he had been genuinely interested in investing in Ryval, that Villavicencio had filmed the videos at his office without his knowledge and that he wasn’t at Jean-Georges that night. Ager-Hanssen said he thought he knew who was behind the operation, but he wouldn’t reveal the person’s identity.
Villavicencio, for his part, seems to have disappeared. Attempts to reach him at the phone number and email address he gave Roche were unsuccessful.
Ager-Hanssen said he didn’t know Villavicencio’s whereabouts. He said he had met the man only a few weeks before Roche came to London and allowed that Villavicencio was probably not his real name. “Of course, it’s someone that doesn’t exist,” he said.
But Ager-Hanssen, in addition to running his venture capital firm, has long had a sideline digging up dirt on behalf of wealthy clients entangled in business disputes in Britain and Scandinavia.
On multiple occasions, he has secretly recorded his targets. For example, in a 2014 interview, he recounted how he had snared the adversary of a Swedish financier with a hidden microphone and boasted that he employed former intelligence officers from the CIA, MI6 and Mossad.
But if Ager-Hanssen did set up Roche, who hired him to do it — and why?
A Series of Clues
Plenty of people had reason to celebrate Roche’s downfall.
First in line were Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and Calvin Ayre, a gambling tycoon who bankrolls Wright. Wright quickly sought to exploit the videos, filing an unsuccessful motion to disqualify Roche Freedman from the Kleiman case. After the videos came out, Ager-Hanssen became CEO of nChain, a company that Ayre funds and that employs Wright as chief science officer.
Through a spokesperson, Ayre acknowledged that he and Wright were “pleased” when the videos came out. But they denied having anything to do with the London sting.
Roche believes them because he thinks he knows who hired Ager-Hanssen: Williams, the British entrepreneur who was the target of Roche Freedman’s biggest pump-and-dump lawsuit.
A series of clues, documented by his former law firm in court filings, led Roche to that conclusion. The first is that on May 12, 2022, Williams wrote on Twitter that he was “coming for” his critics. That was the same day the cryptoleaks.info domain name was registered.
Then, on June 9, 2022, the Crypto Leaks website went live. Billing itself as the defender of “the honest crypto community,” it posted two reports that aligned with Williams’ interests. The first espoused a complicated theory about the ICP token crash that Williams had previously floated on Twitter.
The second attacked the Times for an article it had published about the crash. Williams tweeted a link to that Crypto Leaks report, calling it “Gobsmacking.” The Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit that Williams created to oversee his blockchain, has since sued the Times for defamation in New York. The Times is seeking to dismiss the suit.
The videos of Roche were the crux of Crypto Leaks’ third exposé. After they were published, Williams and Dfinity filed a motion to disqualify Roche Freedman as plaintiffs’ counsel in the pump-and-dump lawsuit, saying Roche’s comments demonstrated “a disregard for the integrity of the judicial system.”
In court filings opposing the motion, Roche’s former firm accused Williams of being behind Crypto Leaks and said the videos filmed at Jean-Georges showed signs of deepfake alterations. It also blamed Williams for the rumored death threats against Roche.
Pete Padovano, a spokesperson for Dfinity and Williams, denied that anyone at the foundation had made death threats. Asked if he was connected to Crypto Leaks, Williams said, “We appreciate the coverage of Crypto Leaks and believe their articles speak for themselves.”
Roche spent last fall lying low, but he has recently begun to rebuild his career as a solo practitioner.
In April, he won a $12.5 million verdict on behalf of six former Cantor Fitzgerald partners who sued the Wall Street firm for withholding some of their compensation. The judgment, which Cantor has appealed, opened the way for Roche to file a separate class action against the firm. Roche is also representing dozens of investors in a dispute with Coinbase.
But Roche’s videotaped remarks continue to dog him and his former firm. Last month, the judge overseeing the pump-and-dump case granted Williams’ motion and disqualified Freedman Normand Friedland as plaintiffs’ counsel.
The judge cited Freedman’s continuing friendship with Roche — and the fact that they together control a cryptocurrency wallet holding more than 1 million AVAX tokens. He also voiced concern that the law firm was consumed by “extreme animosity” toward Williams, which might lead it to turn down equitable settlement offers.
Unless the lead plaintiff can enlist new lawyers by August, the lawsuit is essentially dead. In Roche’s view, the plot against him worked to perfection.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jensen Huang, the C.E.O. of Nvidia, is transforming a black leather jacket into a symbol of the A.I. paradigm shift.
There's a new tech titan in town and he's preparing to enter the pantheon. How do we know?
Well, Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, has the company: He co-founded Nvidia in 1993, and the market cap is now about $ 950 billion, though at the end of May it was briefly in the $ 1 trillion club, putting it in a similar league to Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.
He has the product: a data processing chip that is key to A.I. development, which is to say, the life of ChatGPT and Bard, which is to say, the current paradigm shift.
And he has the look: a black leather jacket he wears every time he is in the public eye, most often with a black T-shirt and black jeans.
Mr. Huang wore a black leather jacket when he was on the cover of Time as one of its men of the year in 2021. A black leather jacket during his keynote speeches at multiple GTC developer conferences since 2018. To deliver the 2023 World ITF keynote and the 2023 Computex 2023 keynote. He even identified himself, back in a Reddit AMA in 2016, as "the guy in the leather jacket."
Sometimes his leather jackets have collars, sometimes they look more like motorcycle jackets; sometime a lot of zips are involved, sometimes not. But the jackets are always black. He has been wearing them, a spokesman said, "for at least 20 years." The point is that he always looks the same.
There hasn't been a popularly identifiable face of A.I. yet. ChatGPT and Bard are anonymous brains. That's part of what makes A.I. so eerie -- its disembodied nature. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, is ubiquitous, but looks kind of generic. Mr. Huang and his leather jacket are poised to step neatly into that gap.
The jacket is an object that has become a signifier -- of a person but also the great leap forward that person represents. And that association puts Mr. Huang in the same club as Steve "black turtleneck" Jobs, Mark "gray T-shirt" Zuckerberg and Jeff "Pitbull" Bezos as a chief executive who understands that the difference between a company that is a world-changing success and a company that is a world-changing success that becomes a part of pop culture may be the image of its figurehead. One that's just enough of a caricature to work its way into the public imagination and become the avatar of a movement.
"It makes a person instantly recognizable, sort of like a cartoon character or superhero," said Richard Thompson Ford, the author of "Dress Codes: How the Laws of Fashion Made History" and a professor at Stanford Law School. It signals "a down-to-earth rejection of fashionable artifice, while still using the power of fashion."
Not that the people involved would put it that way exactly.
Power Uniforms (or the Power of Uniforms)
When asked why they wear the same thing day in and day out, most powerful people who are willing to address the question say it saves time, allowing them to think about whatever pressing issue is at hand, not about what they are going to wear that day.
This is what Barack Obama, who copped to wearing only gray or dark blue suits as president, aside from that one unfortunate tan suit moment, said, as did Mr. Zuckerberg. According to Mr. Huang's spokesman, "he's said before that he dresses in the same style of black pants and shirt because it presents one fewer set of decisions to be made each day." (Mr. Huang himself was "taking a break from speaking to the media," the spokesman said. )
That's unquestionably true. Wearing the same uniform every day also communicates discipline (no flights of fashion here), focus and, Mr. Ford said, "reliability" -- all qualities that are desirable in any chief executive.
But to think that's all that this is about is to miss part of the picture. Anyone with aspirations to global domination, especially in the era of visual communication, would know enough about history to know that.
After all, wearing the same thing every day is a shortcut to crafting a Pavlovian identity in the hive mind -- not just in Silicon Valley but in pretty much any arena. When you think of magazine editors, for example, who comes to mind? Anna Wintour, with her severe bob and dark glasses. When you think of the Supreme Court? Black robes (and maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg's lace collar).
History is littered with figures who understood the power of a consistent visual signature -- so much so that they often had garment styles named after them. Nelson Mandela had the Madiba shirt; Narendra Modi, the Modi Kurta; Jawaharlal Nehru, the Nehru jacket. These associations become impossible to forget, embedded deep in our cerebral cortex, shaping assumptions and opinions. See Elizabeth Holmes and her black turtleneck, which, with its direct link to Steve Jobs, implied brilliance to the watching world, whether we were aware of it or not.
And when it comes to cultural associations, there are few garments as rich in adjectives as a black leather jacket. It is effectively a personality ready-made -- as Mr. Huang is clearly aware.
According to one observer, when the Nvidia chief was walking around Computex in Taipei last month in his leather jacket, he was asked how he could stand the heat. (The temperature on the day of his keynote was between 79 and 90 degrees.)
"I'm always cool," Mr. Huang responded.
The Man in Black
The black leather jacket "connects 1950s Hollywood to a sense of independence, the open road, rebellion and sex appeal," said Joseph Rosenfeld, an image consultant and stylist in Silicon Valley.
It is the uniform of Marlon Brando in "The Wild One" and James Dean in photos almost everywhere. Of the Beats and the Beatles; Elvis and David Bowie (in his Berlin period). It is the opposite of what we think of when we think of a tech nerd, which is why the fact that Mr. Huang chose it as his uniform was so smart. It stands out. It causes a reassessment.
Especially on a 60-year-old man like Mr. Huang. Imagine "if Huang were wearing a suit or even a polo shirt and khakis," Mr. Ford said. "He would look like a boring, conventional middle manager." Instead, he said, the leather jacket "signals that he's a creative type and a high status person who can wear whatever he wants."
When I asked ChatGPT, "Why does Jensen Huang wear the same black leather jacket all the time?" it responded with four options, including the suggestion that "Leather jackets, particularly black ones, are often associated with a sense of confidence, authority and professionalism." Also motorcycles, which are about speed.
The jacket also connects to a founding myth of Silicon Valley and Mr. Jobs, the man who was the antithesis of the men in gray suits at IBM, and "almost a spiritual leader for some," as Mr. Ford said. Someone, he said, "who represents a sort of golden age, when everything seemed possible and people still thought tech would be a force for good in the world" -- a particularly salient reminder at a time when the public conversation is centered in part on the potential threat of A.I.
And the jacket strategy is adding up. According to Mr. Rosenfeld, "Clients have asked me about the leather jacket, wanting to know if they can wear the same." (He said he told them Mr. Huang already owned the look and advised that they develop another signature.)
For those who want to know what brand Mr. Huang wears, his spokesman said he did not know. Unlike Mr. Jobs, who owned many versions of the same Issey Miyake turtleneck (or Mr. Zuckerberg, who wears Brunello Cucinelli T-shirts), Mr. Huang appears to vary his jackets. But Mr. Rosenfeld guessed that "they don't appear to be Tom Ford level, which we know he could well afford. At least some that I've seen look to be Theory."
For those who want to get the look, however, at least seven different e-tailers currently offer "Jensen Huang leather jackets" at prices from $ 109 (Jacketpop) to $ 149.99 (the Genuine Leather).
To put this in context, Superstar Jacket sells two versions of a "Jensen Huang leather jacket," alongside a "Fast & Furious 10 Vin Diesel jacket," a "Snoop Dogg leather jacket" and an "Indiana Jones leather jacket."
But Mr. Huang is the only C.E.O. to have a jacket named after him.

A.I. Leader Is Courting Washington: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chief executive of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, has met with at least 100 U.S. lawmakers in recent months. He has also taken his show abroad.
Weeks after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot last year, Sam Altman, the chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up, launched a lobbying blitz in Washington.
He demonstrated ChatGPT at a breakfast with more than 20 lawmakers in the Capitol. He called for A.I. to be regulated in private meetings with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders. In all, Mr. Altman has discussed the rapidly evolving technology with at least 100 members of Congress, as well as with Vice President Kamala Harris and cabinet members at the White House, according to lawmakers and the Biden administration.
"It's so refreshing," said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and the chair of a panel that held an A.I. hearing last month featuring Mr. Altman. "He was willing, able and eager."
Technology chief executives have typically avoided the spotlight of government regulators and lawmakers. It took threats of subpoenas and public humiliation to persuade Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google to testify before Congress in recent years.
But Mr. Altman, 38, has run toward the spotlight, seeking the attention of lawmakers in a way that has thawed icy attitudes toward Silicon Valley companies. He has initiated meetings and jumped at the opportunity to testify in last month's Senate hearing. And instead of protesting regulations, he has invited lawmakers to impose sweeping rules to hold the technology to account.
Mr. Altman has also taken his show on the road, delivering a similar message about A.I. on a 17-city tour of South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. In recent weeks, he has met with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.
"We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models," Mr. Altman said in last month's Senate hearing.
His charm offensive has put him in an important seat of influence. By engaging with lawmakers early, Mr. Altman is shaping the debate on governing A.I. and educating Washington on the complexities of the technology, especially as fears of it grow. Taking a page out of recent history, he is also working to sidestep the pitfalls that befell social media companies, which are a constant target of lawmakers, and to pave the way for A.I.
His actions may help cement OpenAI's position at the forefront of a debate on A.I. regulation. Microsoft, Google, IBM and A.I. start-ups have drawn battle lines on proposed rules and differ on how much government interference they want in their industry. The fissures have led other tech chiefs to plead their cases with the Biden administration, members of Congress and global regulators.
So far, Mr. Altman's strategy appears to be working. U.S. lawmakers have turned to him as an educator and adviser. Last month, he gave a briefing on ChatGPT to dozens of members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House A.I. caucus. He has proposed the creation of an independent regulatory agency for A.I., licensing of the technology and safety standards.
"I have a lot of respect for Sam," said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who hosted Mr. Altman for dinner with more than a dozen other senators last month.
But how long such good will can last is uncertain. Some lawmakers cautioned against becoming overly reliant on Mr. Altman and other tech leaders to educate them on the explosion of new A.I. technologies.
"He does seem different, and it was nice for him to testify," said Senator Josh Hawley, the ranking Republican in the Senate hearing. "But I don't think we ought to be too laudatory of his company just yet."
OpenAI said that with the benefit of learning from the tech industry's past mistakes, it wanted to bridge the knowledge gap between Silicon Valley and Washington on A.I. and help shape regulations.
"We don't want this to be like previous technological revolutions," said Anna Makanju, OpenAI's head of public policy, who leads a small team of five policy experts. Mr. Altman, she said, "knows that this is an important period, so he tries to say yes to as many of these kinds of meetings as possible."
Mr. Altman has been sounding the alarm over A.I.'s potential risks for years while also talking up the technology. In 2015, while leading the start-up incubator Y Combinator, he co-founded OpenAI with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and others. He wrote in a blog post at the time that governments should regulate the most powerful tools of A.I.
"In an ideal world, regulation would slow down the bad guys and speed up the good guys," he wrote.
Mr. Altman has long held the view that it is better to engage early with regulators, Ms. Makanju said.
In 2018, when OpenAI published a statement on its mission, it promised to put a priority on safety, which implied the involvement of regulators, Ms. Makanju said. In 2021, when the company released DALL-E, an A.I. tool that creates images from text commands, the company sent its chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, to showcase the technology for lawmakers.
In January, Mr. Altman traveled to Washington to speak at an off-the-record breakfast with members of Congress organized by the Aspen Institute. He answered questions and previewed GPT-4, OpenAI's new A.I. engine, which he said was built with better security features.
Mr. Altman has surprised some lawmakers with his candor about A.I.'s risks. In a meeting with Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, at OpenAI's San Francisco offices in March, Mr. Altman said A.I. could have a devastating effect on labor, reducing the workweek from five days to one.
"He's very direct," said Mr. Lieu, who holds a degree in computer science.
Mr. Altman visited Washington again in early May for a White House meeting with Ms. Harris and the chief executives of Microsoft, Google and the A.I. start-up Anthropic. During the trip, he also discussed regulatory ideas and concerns about China's development of A.I. with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader.
In mid-May, Mr. Altman returned for a two-day marathon of public and private appearances with lawmakers, starting with a dinner hosted by Mr. Lieu and Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, with 60 House members at the Capitol. Over a buffet of roast chicken, potatoes and salad, he wowed the crowd for two and a half hours by showing ChatGPT and answering questions.
"Write a bill about naming a post office after Representative Ted Lieu," he typed into the ChatGPT prompt that appeared on a big screen, according to Mr. Lieu. "Write a speech for Representative Mike Johnson introducing the bill," he wrote as a second prompt.
The answers were convincing, Mr. Lieu said, and elicited chuckles and raised eyebrows from the audience.
The next morning, Mr. Altman testified at the Senate hearing about A.I.'s risks. He presented a list of regulatory ideas and supported proposals by lawmakers, including Mr. Blumenthal's idea of consumer risk labels on A.I. tools that would be akin to nutrition labels for food.
"I'm so used to witnesses coming in and trying to persuade us with talking points," Mr. Blumenthal said. "The difference with Sam Altman is that he is having a conversation."
After the hearing, which lasted three hours, Mr. Altman briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee on A.I.'s security risks. That evening, he spoke at Mr. Warner's dinner at the Harvest Tide Steakhouse on Capitol Hill. (Mr. Altman is vegetarian.)
He has also benefited from a partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in the start-up. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said he and Mr. Altman provided each other feedback on drafts of memos and blog posts. The companies also coordinated messaging ahead of the White House meeting, Mr. Smith said.
"Any day that we can actually support each other is a good day because we're trying to do something together," he said.
Some researchers and competitors said OpenAI had too much influence over debates on A.I. regulations. Mr. Altman's proposals on licensing and testing could benefit more established A.I. companies like his, said Marietje Schaake, a fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford and a former member of the European Parliament.
"He's not only an expert, he's a stakeholder," Ms. Schaake said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, the authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Mr. Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that the accused killer had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took over six weeks -- weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the murders. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as "targeted" and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, the authorities eventually backtracked.
"We cannot say that there is no threat to the community," the police chief, James Fry, said at a news conference on Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the F.B.I. to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home's back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners' addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 the police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Mr. Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a Ph.D. in criminology.
They checked Mr. Kohberger's car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Ms. Goncalves's car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims' house from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims' bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on U.P.S. delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Ms. Goncalves's account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account-holders, including their locations, credit card information and any "private images, pictures or videos" associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 different people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"You couldn't get one warrant to search 19 houses," he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area -- including one in Idaho and two in Washington State -- while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Mr. Kohberger's name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for bread crumbs.
"You could say this is uncharted territory," Mr. Kerr said. "They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there."
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the F.B.I.'s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites' data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
"That is why the Idaho case is so interesting," she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
F.B.I. personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university eight miles from the murder scene.
Mr. Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by the police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Mr. Kohberger's cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks -- perhaps turned off -- in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Mr. Kohberger's family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against their original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whoever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Mr. Kohberger was arrested on Dec. 30.
"We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe," the police chief, Mr. Fry, announced. "But we still do need to be vigilant, right?"

Casey DeSantis Is Your Obsession. Jill Biden's Mine.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: From the breathless media coverage of Ron DeSantis's recent visits to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, you could easily get the impression that:
Voting starts in approximately five minutes.
You're really watching a new Netflix series about a body snatcher's attempts to pantomime just enough humanity to amass power on Planet Earth.
The Florida governor's entire candidacy hinges on his wife, Casey DeSantis.
She could be RuPaul at a drag ball for all the attention she's getting. She could be the sorcerer in Disney's "Fantasia" for all the magic journalists are primed for: When she's with her grumpy guv, will her sunshine melt his ice? Can her aptitude for small talk make up for his allergy to it? And when she trots out the couple's three children, ages 3 to 6, will voters be reminded of and charmed by her husband's youth? (He's 44 to Donald Trump's 76.)
Those are the wrong questions about Casey DeSantis. And they reflect how wrongly we in the media often approach the subject of political spouses in general.
We wildly overestimate their potential impact on a politician's image. I've spoken to many, many voters over the years, and I've emerged from exactly zero of those conversations thinking: "Wow, Barack is going to owe Michelle for a few hundred of this state's votes." Or: "Tipper just swung that state out of Al's win column."
Back when Bill Clinton was running for the White House, some pundits cast Hillary Clinton as a poison pill with voters in the middle. Last I checked, he won two presidential elections in a row.
And I challenge you to find me one voter, just one, whose pro or con decision about Trump hinged on his third wife. Where, by the way, is she? And how, pray tell, did she assist his 2016 victory? I'd forgotten all about her until she came up the other day in a Daily Beast headline that called Casey DeSantis "the Walmart Melania." Better than "the Bergdorf Melania," which would be redundant. It would also summon thoughts of a certain dressing room and would disregard Republicans' populist conversion. They're now all about the little guy and gal! Well, except when they're doling out tax cuts.
But while we tend to exaggerate the importance of what a spouse does in public, we sometimes shortchange the relevance of what a spouse does in private. That's where and how Casey DeSantis probably matters most.
By many accounts, including an especially thorough profile of her by Michael Kruse in Politico recently, she's "uncommonly involved" (Kruse's words) in all aspects of her husband's career: strategy, policy, the friends-and-enemies scorecard. He doesn't simply turn to her in a dutiful, chivalrous, "And what do you think, honey?" fashion. She's no afterthought. She's the first thought. And the second thought. And the very last thought.
The political spouse I observed most closely, Laura Bush, was much more consequential behind the scenes than in front of the cameras. She in fact recoiled from the spotlight. But George W.'s aides relished her presence on the campaign trail with him because she calmed him, grounded him, took the bluster out of him whenever he was getting blustery.
She read the news coverage about him so that he didn't have to, and she would tell him what he needed to know but not what would make him fume pointlessly at us journalists in the back of the plane. That was her impact -- not the way she dressed, not how she styled her hair, not the degree of verve or humor with which she delivered public remarks when she consented to do that. She regulated his emotional temperature.
I get the impression that Jill Biden does likewise with Joe, to an extent that could be absolutely critical to what happens in November 2024.
That Jill gets a say and gets her way was clear in a priceless anecdote that she included in her 2019 memoir, "Where the Light Enters." She recalled being by the pool and hearing her husband's political advisers, who were inside with him, trying to persuade him to enter the 2004 presidential race. She and Joe had ruled that out.
"A Sharpie caught my eye," she wrote. "I drew NO on my stomach in big letters, and marched through the room in my bikini."
President Biden is 80. It's not ageist to observe that over the months between now and Election Day, he must pace himself carefully, watch his health closely, do all he can to decrease the odds of any stammer or stumble that will be turned against him. He must stay focused and optimistic, which means tuning out as much of the Hunter Biden melodrama as he can. Rest is vital. Mood is pivotal.
And no one -- not Ron Klain, not Mike Donilon, not Anita Dunn -- can help with that the way Jill can. So, you go ahead and put Walmart Melania under a microscope. I'll be over here putting White House Jill on a pedestal.

Words Worth Sidelining: Canine Edition
My computers' operating systems demand to be updated yearly, it seems. Several of my apps cry out for renewal every few months. So how is it that archaic sayings hang around for not just decades but centuries past the point of any coherence?
I direct you to the doggedness of phrases that invoke dogs. I can't square them with the ways of my dog, Regan, and of most of the other American pooches I know.
It's still said that someone "works like a dog." How many of the dogs around you do arduous physical labor -- do any physical labor -- or keep even a 9-to-5 schedule of other tasks? Barking at the Amazon delivery person doesn't count.
A hypochondriacal friend of mine always announces: "I'm sick as a dog!" In my experience, dogs are significantly hardier than we humans. No cold compresses, no hot tea, no Purell, no Pepto Bismol.
"A dog's life" means a harsh one, never mind the Instagram parade of golden retrievers in platinum digs, French bulldogs in haute couture and Siberian huskies that will never come within a snowball's toss of a sled (or of Siberia).
And those furry social-media stars nosh on treats, not one another. So the phrase "dog-eat-dog world" baffles me. They're dachshunds, not the Donner party.
Also, I detect, at least in English, some semantic inequality between dogs and cats, with the former starring in more negative metaphors ("lie down with dogs, get up with fleas," "call off the dogs") than the latter do.
To wit: Donald Trump so frequently took a canine tack with his insults that Philip Rucker wrote an entire article in The Washington Post about how, in Trump's "singular lexicon, there is no more vicious put-down than likening an adversary to a dog." "Choked like a dog," "fired like a dog," "sweat like a dog" -- Trump had used all of those and more.
Cats got off easy. Don't they always? If someone calls you "the cat's meow," "the cat's pajamas" or a "cool cat," you have cause to purr. A "fat cat" indulging in a "cat nap" has anything but "a dog's life."
That said, I cringe at hearing that someone "let the cat out of the bag." What sadist almost suffocated the kitty in the first place?
Let's retire that phrase, along with the digs about dogs above. While we're at it, let's rethink "kill two birds with one stone." I'd rather let the feathered creatures live. And I'm not much for hurling heavy objects, just as Regan isn't much for fetching heavy, medium-weight or even light ones. She can't be bothered with all that back-and-forth when there are soft patches of grass on which to sun herself. It's a dog's life.

For the Love of Sentences
In The Washington Post, Mattie Kahn took issue with the word "fearless" being applied so often and fashionably to young women today: "We haven't really created a generation of unflinching girls. With our broken world, we've scared them into action." (Thanks to Olga Adler of Delray Beach, Fla., for nominating this.)
Also in the Post, Paul Waldman took the measure of Mike Pence's appeal beyond the Republican primaries: "Voters are not clamoring for someone to tell them why we need to cut taxes for the rich and outlaw abortion, delivered in the tone of a stepdad explaining why you're being grounded for the rest of the school year." (Adam Schmuckler, Olney, Md., and Alfred Reid, Durham, N.C.)
And David Von Drehle used the occasion of the P.G.A.-LIV golf merger to reflect on the odd career of a golfer centrally involved in it: "Greg Norman with a four-stroke lead in a major tournament was like a cat leaping onto a narrow shelf of Limoges. You just covered your eyes and waited for the sound of disaster." (Christopher Dodson, Montville, N.J., and Joe Bohr, Park City, Utah, among others) Von Drehle's article also had the clever observation that "golf was for decades -- for centuries -- the province of people who cared about money but never spoke of it openly. Scots. Episcopalians. Members of the Walker and Bush families. People who built huge homes then failed to heat them properly. People who drove around with big dogs in their old Mercedes station wagons. People who greeted the offer of a scotch and soda by saying, 'Well, it's 5 o'clock somewhere!"' (Jessica N. Lange, Beavercreek, Ohio)
In The Times, Kurt Streeter reassessed the PGA's onetime pose of rectitude in light of the merger: "The PGA Tour presented itself as the guy who calls a penalty on himself if he accidentally moves his ball a quarter-inch. Turns out it was the guy who makes a double-bogey and marks it down as a par." (John Daly, Richmond, Va., and Doug Hardy, Concord, Mass., among others)
Also in The Times, Ezra Klein marveled at how little, in the end, Republicans extracted from the debt-ceiling standoff: "Threatening default -- and we came within days of it this time -- in order to get a deal like this is like threatening to detonate a bomb beneath the bank unless the teller gives you $ 150 and a commemorative mug." (Will Rothfuss, Stroudsburg, Penn., and Anita Moran, San Francisco, among many others)
In The New Yorker, Amanda Petrusich examined Paul Simon's newest album, "Seven Psalms," a deeply spiritual reflection on human life: "Outside religious spaces, posing the big questions -- how we arrived here; what we're supposed to do with the time we've been allotted -- is generally considered the terrain of undergraduate philosophy majors and people who have gravely misjudged their tolerance for edibles." (Helen Pelletier, Portland, Maine, and Michael O'Keefe, San Juan Cosala, Mexico, among many others)
An article in The Economist assessed DeSantis's apparent reticence and long delay before he squarely took on Donald Trump: "It is as if Brutus had overslept on the Ides of March, giving Julius Caesar a chance to put on his armor, but had tried to proceed with his hit job all the same. The plot to overthrow Mr. Trump, which once seemed plausible, now looks forlorn." (Howard Stambor, Seattle, and Harry Gerecke, Vashon, Wash.)
And in GQ, Alex Pappademas had a grand time profiling the musician Dave Matthews and noted that when "someone tells you they don't like Dave Matthews, they're really voicing a deep tribal aversion to the type of person they picture when they picture a Dave Matthews fan -- spiritually incurious trustafarians, pumpkin-spice basics, fleece-vest I.P.A. bros, or whichever straw-man stereotype offends their imagination most." Matthews owns a Tesla "but he's a little embarrassed by it -- specifically the gull-wing doors, because it's basically impossible to be a rock star and get out of a car with gull-wing doors without looking like an asshole, especially if you're wearing sunglasses." (Kate Schultz, Madison, Wis.)

On a Personal Note
The presidential race is heating up, even at this early stage. The war between Ukraine and Russia continues to rage. Robert Kennedy Jr. is cyber-hobnobbing with Elon Musk, in a convergence of runaway vanity and ruinous nonsense that's scarily emblematic of the United States circa 2023.
But the article that everybody I know was talking about most over the past week was Tim Alberta's profile in The Atlantic of Chris Licht, who had been in charge at CNN for 13 baffling and tumultuous months and, it turned out, was days away from being canned.
That's largely because my circle of acquaintance is bloated with people in the news business. We can navel-gaze with the best of them. But it also reflects the richness of the portrait of Licht that Alberta deftly paints.
His article (behind a paywall, which may or may not block you) is about more than CNN, more than Licht. It's about tendencies and traps that many people have skirted or tumbled into. It's about confidence bleeding into grandiosity, defensiveness edging into reclusiveness, bluntness becoming coldness. It examines the lies we tell ourselves about the deals and compromises we've made.
The key scene, for me, is the one in which Licht huffs, puffs and perspires at an elite gym with a quirky personal trainer. He hoists a heavy pole. He does a side plank. He pushes a weighted sleigh. He tells Alberta, who's there, "Zucker couldn't do this shit." That's Jeff Zucker, who ran CNN before him.
What's the point of that statement? And why is Licht letting Alberta watch him work out? One answer -- which I can relate to as a large person who struggles to lose weight -- is that Licht was 226 pounds three years ago but 178 when Alberta spent time with him. He's surely proud of that.
But what's also happening in that scene -- what apparently happened during the whole of Licht's time at CNN -- is that someone who built his career making other people (Joe Scarborough, Stephen Colbert, Gayle King) look good is overly relishing his moment in the spotlight. He's forgetting what his job is. He's losing sight of the larger picture.
It's a recognizable human error. And it's a cautionary tale with resonance far beyond the world of journalism.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Our critic says "Chosen Memories" at MoMA is one of the most stirring recent collection shows. The theme of change and instability is a binding thread.
The land of the brave and home of the free has always been bearish about borders, about who gets in, who stays out. Politically we're feeling that tension hugely now. And it's always been evident culturally in, for example, the kind of art our museums have brought through the door.
The Museum of Modern Art's long but sporadic pattern of collecting 20th century Latin American art offers a constructive gauge. Early in it favored art that it seemed to view as a species of exotica: folkloric, surreal, evidence that south of the border was wild, barely-modern terrain.
After World War II, with cultural exchange increasingly used as a diplomatic tool, MoMA wanted further engagement with new Latin American art, but now art of a kind that looked to be made by "people like us" -- that is, work that appeared to carry clear evidence of European DNA, like geometric abstraction.
Then, in the 1970s came the global recession. Art markets went bust. And in the confusion, walls began to come down as the permission-giving shake-up called multiculturalism -- pro-diversity, anti-essentialist -- arrived.
More and more, as that initiating episode of what is sometimes called postmodernism recedes into history, it looks to be one of 20th century art's finest, most germinative hours. MoMA has taken a long time -- decades -- to get on board with this, but is well along to judge by "Chosen Memories: Contemporary Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift and Beyond," one of the most stirring museum collection shows I've seen in New York in a while.
In the 1970s Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, a native of Venezuela and a longtime MoMA trustee, was already interested in Latin American art over a broad spectrum: Indigenous art; 19th-century work made by Europeans traveling there; hybrid colonial artifacts; and modernist painting and sculpture. In 2016, she gave the museum more than 100 modernist works, and there was a show. But already by then she had turned her attention to new art and in 2019 there was an even larger gift, this one of contemporary work, including photography and video.
Some three dozen examples, most dating from the past three decades and supplemented by loans, make up the current show. And together they reflect -- and critically reflect on -- all the categories of Latin American art that interested her from the start.
For example, the complex history of colonialism, largely expunged from modernist abstraction, is brought into play in one of the exhibition's earliest entries, "The Catherwood Project" by the Argentine artist Leandro Katz.
In the 1840s, the English artist Frederick Catherwood traveled twice to Central America and made drawings of Maya ruins there. Published as prints, his images gave the European public a first look at these ancient monuments and established a romanticized vision of the "New World" that persists into the tour-bus present. In his "Catherwood" series. Katz considers the accuracy of those images through on-the-spot comparisons: He photographs himself holding up the illustrator's images in front of the Maya monuments they depict. Katz notes Catherwood's manipulations, but also understands that he is inevitably adding his own distorting 20th-century view to a layered perceptual history.
Indigenous culture, crucial to but underacknowledged by European modernism, is referred to repeatedly in the show. In 1996, the Mexican-born artist Laura Anderson Barbata spent time with Yanomami people in the Venezuelan Amazon rainforest learning, hands on, how they created their graceful canoes. In exchange for this instruction, she taught them papermaking. We see the fruits of reciprocity in the show: in a photograph, that Barbata has titled "Self-portrait," of a hand-carved boat standing upright as if it had a life of its own; and in lissome drawings of Amazonian fauna and flora by the Yanomami artist Sheroanawe Hakihiiwe, all done on handmade fiber paper.
Some artists make a deft, playful thing of tradition. The Mexican artist Gabriel Kuri toys with notions of value, labor and consumer culture in his loom-woven image of a supermarket receipt. So does the Puerto Rico collective called "Las Nietas de Nonó," composed of two sisters (Mulowayi Iyaye Nonó and Mapenzi Chibale Nonó) who, isolated during the pandemic, turned their daily life into a kind of back-to-basics hunter-gather picnic.
What's taken seriously is something that most mainstream Western art doesn't know what to do with anymore, but which multiculturism notably respected: spirituality. In a 2020 painting by the Dominican-born artist Firelei Báez, a powerful Afro-Caribbean female deity dances across and dominates a 16th-century European map of the Atlantic Ocean.
And in pencil drawings, the Colombian-Korean artist Gala Porras-Kim documents hundreds of textile fragment left, centuries ago, as temple offerings to the Mayan rain god and now preserved in an ethnological museum at Harvard University. Included in the show is a letter the artist wrote to the museum's director asking her to release the offerings from their archival prison and permit them to turn to dust as their givers intended. Their perishability, she argues, is what made them powerful.
The theme of change and instability, here often framed as loss, is one of the show's binding threads, and a complicated one. Historically, loss can be violent, as suggested in a fierce work by the always astonishing, go-for-broke Guatemalan performance artist Regina José Galindo. For a 2010 work called "Looting," which addresses the extractive depredations of European colonialism on her mineral-rich homeland, she had a dentist in Guatemala fit eight of her teeth with fillings made of locally mined gold, and then asked a second dentist, in Europe, to remove the fillings, which are displayed as art in a vitrine.
Several works about loss are, like hers, politically loaded. A short video titled "Black Anthropology II" from 2014 by Paulo Nazareth is one. In it, the artist lies half-buried under piles of human skulls and bones, the remains of Afro-Brazilian prisoners that he found stored in a police museum in Bahia.
In a 1989 photograph titled "The Two Fridas," the Chilean gay activists Francisco Casas Silva and Pedro Mardones Lemebel (1952-2015) pose, bare-chested and skirted, their bodies connected by IV tubing, in an AIDS-era riff on Kahlo's famed double self-portrait.
Their picture can be read as a tribute to partnership, artistic, or affectional, or both. So can a jaunty little sculpture assembled from a music stand, a pair of garden shears, and a single rose, dedicated to a friend -- a lover? -- by the elusive Venezuelan polymath Claudio Perna (1938-1997).
There's a memorial vibe to this piece, as there is to a 2009 video that was actually conceived as a gesture of mourning-in-advance by the Uruguayan artist Alejandro Cesarco. Titled "Present Memory" (2010) it's a silent filmed portrait of Cesarco's father, a doctor, made soon after he'd received a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. We see the older man, with his elegant suit and extravagant mustache, sitting impassively in his office and being viewed repeatedly from various angles, as if to fix his features in our minds. Then the camera travels round the room, now empty. He's gone.
Some fundamental tone of the show -- organized by Inés Katzenstein, curator of Latin American Art at MoMA, and director of the Cisneros Research Institute, and Julia Detchon, a curatorial assistant -- is distilled here: a kind of uneasy, ironic, reality-check melancholy that feels very different from the utopianism often attributed to Latin American art on the basis of the geometric abstract painting that has, until recently, defined it in many North American museum collections.
Actually, geometric abstraction has a presence, though an ambiguous one, in "Chosen Memories," in the form of a site-specific mural painting by the Brazilian artist Iran do Espírito Santo. Composed entirely of vertical lines in subtly varying shades of gray, the painting is hard to see it first, like a passing shadow, or a dark smudge. It seems both to soil the white gallery wall and to dissolve it, to be either a meditational aid or a mistake. Titled "En Passant" and commissioned for the occasion, it will physically disappear when the show is done, but stay vivid as an idea, like much of the rest of what's here.

Air Travel Could Become Even More Miserable: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Were you planning on a last-minute trip to Orlando to visit Gov. Ron DeSantis's favorite amusement park? "Prices are currently high for your search," warns Google Flights. Well, yes they are.
And yes, fares have been high throughout our last two years of "revenge travel" mode. Packed jets, ill-tempered passengers, bad airline management and weather roulette contributed to some miserable travel conditions last year, when more than 180,000 flights were canceled, according to Department of Transportation data. While the Federal Aviation Administration is corralling tantrum throwing grown-ups, there's not much the agency can do about climate change-induced weather events.
The industry is also struggling with staffing shortages that have contributed to domestic airline capacity, relative to the economy, remaining below prepandemic levels. This summer, when our overheating climate starts spinning thunderstorms and hurricanes around the country, we could be back to business as miserable.
Against this backdrop of diminishing expectations, JetBlue Airways stood out. The carrier's first flight took off in 2000 from busy, brusque Kennedy Airport and actually delivered on the promise of a better in-flight experience -- bigger coach seats, more palatable food, free satellite television and pricing that got competitors' attention. JetBlue's history as a lower-priced disrupter is so well known it's called "the JetBlue Effect." The mere threat of JetBlue sniffing new turf is enough to keep the major players in check.
But now JetBlue wants to be a major player, too. It formed the Northeast Alliance with American Airlines in 2021 and, a year later, announced its planned acquisition of ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines. At a time when four airlines and their tightly coupled networks control 80 percent of the domestic traffic, the U.S. government is fighting both deals. Last month, a federal judge ordered JetBlue and American to disentangle the Northeast Alliance. American said it would appeal.
As a journalist who has covered big mergers and airline operations, I'm taking the government's side in this fight. If JetBlue is allowed to grow as big as it wants, market forces figure to make the JetBlue Effect evaporate like a vapor trail from one of its jets.
In other parts of the travel and hospitality industry, innovation is a driving force. Hyatt Hotels, for instance, just started a concept called Hyatt Studios, for extended-stay guests, that is the latest of the more than two dozen brands in the company's portfolio. Innovation in airlines, however, is rarer than reward seats during the holiday season. While most goods and services improve over decades, air travel has defied progress -- with the very important exception of safety. Innovative airline start-ups are relatively rare. One of the most recent is Breeze Airways, founded by David Neeleman -- who also founded JetBlue.
Why don't airlines innovate? Part of the answer is that they are in a capital-intense business and are largely driven by chief financial officers, while hotel management companies are asset-light and are driven by customer service managers. The former asks: How much more money can I squeeze out of this very expensive piece of equipment? The latter asks: How can I improve the customer experience and get paid for it? Which is why the experience of arriving at your hotel is so much better than the experience of flying to your destination.
The operating structure of the industry has also made innovation difficult, particularly post-pandemic. When JetBlue started, it attracted thousands of résumés from pilots. Today, the carriers are short thousands of pilots and other professionals. Likewise, there were takeoff and landing slots available at J.F.K. in 2000. Today, the four major carriers control most of these precious slots in major airports and aren't keen to surrender them. Want new jets? The production wait can be years long.
Nor is the industry vulnerable to outsiders. Transportation disrupters such as Uber and Lime made a strategy out of flouting local regulations and asking for permission later. That's not an option in air travel: You can't show up at LaGuardia with a jet and declare yourself open for business.
Since the arrival of ultra low-cost carriers like Spirit, innovation has come mostly in the form of pricing. By unbundling each part of the journey and then tacking on fees -- for an assigned seat, for stowing your luggage, for the overhead bin, for getting a printed ticket, for early boarding -- average airfares have fallen. That has helped make it possible for many more people to share in the pain of flying.
Logically, as passengers, we'd want more of what JetBlue brought to the business. Its chief executive, Robin Hayes, has promised as much, arguing that a JetBlue-Spirit combination equals more comfort and better services, value priced. "This is the anti-merger merger," he said in a meeting with Times Opinion in March. He maintains that the combined carriers, which represent about 9 percent of the domestic market, will be able to form a more muscular network that could better take on Delta, Southwest, United and its likely soon-to-be-former partner American.
The Department of Justice is positing that a post-merger JetBlue can't be the same innovative company it claims it will be. JetBlue can't imagine not being that same company. But when companies scale, or start making big acquisitions, they can't necessarily bring their cultures with them, whatever they want to believe. We once thought Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google were cool. Then they became FAANG, an acronym that connotes Big Tech.
The more prosaic view, though, is that JetBlue is buying assets to bulk up. Spirit has roughly 190 Airbus A320 family jets and, just as important, the pilots to fly them. That will allow JetBlue to grow faster than it could organically, if at a high cost. Spirit will most likely disappear in a couple of years, which a cynic might note is not necessarily a bad thing, given its on-time record.
A bigger JetBlue figures to have less reason to innovate because it will have greater pressure to protect its newly expanded turf. Airline mergers inevitably create fortress hubs -- United's combination with Continental erected one in Newark. And JetBlue's Northeast Alliance with American has already congealed into fortress hubs at J.F.K., LaGuardia and Boston Logan, the Justice Department charged. Fortress hubs result in higher fares. Once in a position of market power, why would JetBlue, or any company, charge less than it can get people to pay?
Wall Street is forever urging capacity discipline to protect profitability. Consider, too, that JetBlue took on debt to finance the $ 3.38 billion all-cash purchase of Spirit. Which is to say that JetBlue will face considerable obstacles to remain true blue to its disruptive culture.
Given the industry's past success in mergers, JetBlue's chances of capturing Spirit are still good. But a bigger JetBlue would make the carrier a bigger barrier for the creation of a future JetBlue-like airline. That would be unfortunate.
In the postwar jet age era, industry pioneers such as Pan Am's Juan Trippe, who introduced both the 707 and the 747 into service, knew that the sky was the limit. In the current era, Mr. Trippe might have discovered that the sky is very limited. The JetBlue-Spirit merger would only make it more so.

Full text: Tucked into the measure are changes to how the government approves projects at the center of the country's climate goals.
President Biden and Congress have wrangled a big political deal to raise the country's debt ceiling.
Tucked into that deal are some changes to how the government approves new projects that bear on the country's climate goals, whether pipelines or bus lanes. While these tweaks are fairly modest, they're part of a broader push by many lawmakers for something known as permitting reform, which could affect how quickly the United States cleans up its climate pollution.
We want to break that down for you today, without the wonky jargon.
Trust us, this is not just a Washington political story. It affects you and your communities. Also foreign policy.
Behind the jargon: A way to get big things done.
Permitting reform refers to efforts to change the rules, including those under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, that govern how, and how quickly, federal agencies authorize big projects. That could be congestion pricing on cars in Manhattan or a big solar array on federal lands, or, hardest of all, transmission lines that can go through many state and city jurisdictions.
Those who want to build any of those projects have to first detail what the environmental impacts could be, and they have to seek public input. It's, well, democracy.
The debt ceiling deal would surely speed up one thing.
That's the Mountain Valley Pipeline. It's a big win for the established oil and gas producers and their champion in the Senate, Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat. How polluting the pipeline would be is a matter of debate. But opponents say a new gas pipeline, which would operate for decades, defies the scientific consensus that the world needs to move quickly away from fossil fuels in order to slow down climate change.
So would renewable energy projects get built faster?
That's unclear.
One section of the bill is designed to speed up energy projects of all kinds, polluting or not, by designating a lead agency to oversee environmental reviews and requiring that they are completed in one to two years. In theory, that could speed up oil and gas projects as well as renewables. But those deadlines could prove tough to enforce, and some experts say those changes would have only a modest impact.
It doesn't resolve the most urgent question.
Most significantly, the bill leaves unsettled whether the permitting of new transmission lines will be accelerated.
Why are transmission lines so important? Because they can carry electricity from solar arrays and wind farms to the communities that need it. There aren't nearly enough of them, as we explained in a recent article. The sheer volume of wind and solar projects that have been built recently "has overwhelmed the nation's antiquated systems to connect new sources of electricity to homes and businesses."
There's also the need to make the electricity grid flexible enough to deal with higher demand when extreme heat or cold prompts us to crank up air-conditioners or heaters. Right now, our systems are often not fit for that purpose. It's one of the reasons we're seeing power failures during heat waves and winter storms, and that's super dangerous.
A whole host of things stand in the way of new transmission lines, including permitting and arguments over who should pay for them.
So how did the debt ceiling negotiations address this? They didn't.
Democrats had floated a proposal to encourage new transmission lines that would connect different parts of the country but that was stripped out. Instead, the bill mandates that the issue be studied. There have been many such studies already. So the debt ceiling deal may end up delaying efforts to modernize the grid.
While lawmakers say they will revisit transmission later, critics say this was a missed opportunity at a time when the United States needs to move far more quickly. Some worry that Congress may have missed its best shot to encourage new power lines. And the stakes are high: One study found that unless the United States speeds up the rate at which it builds transmission, more than 80 percent of the climate benefits of last year's big clean energy law could be squandered.
How does this affect America's global standing?
The Biden administration's ability to show the world that it is serious about taking climate action rests not only on its bold promises to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions but also on its ability to keep its promises. Without grid modernization, that could prove extremely difficult.
Environmental campaigners have something new to weigh: Is faster better?
NEPA has been used to delay and block all kinds of big infrastructure projects, including oil and gas pipelines. Campaigners have become deft at stopping things, using environmental regulations.
Now, though, the United States needs to get much better at building new infrastructure quickly to meet its climate goals. That could be a new subway line or a bus-only lane to encourage city commuters to rely less on cars. Or it could mean an offshore wind farm, or those transmission lines that can get that wind energy to homes and businesses to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The question now is whether the permitting process for those projects should be streamlined. And if it is, would that cause more environmental harm in the places where they are built and for the plants and animals that live there?

Crackdown on 'Cop City' Protests Targets Bail Fund: [National Desk]

Full text: The arrest of three activists for financial crimes has been assailed as retaliation for lawful protests. Officials said the three had "facilitated and encouraged domestic terrorism."
Atlanta police officers and agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation swarmed a house this week that has long been known in the city as a hub of activism.
Three people were arrested inside, charged with money laundering and charity fraud for spending connected to the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which has paid bail and provided legal support for protesters fighting plans for a new police and fire training complex widely known by its derisive nickname, "Cop City."
Civil liberties groups and a number of elected officials have condemned the charges as egregious retaliation for lawful protests. The arrests have inflamed an already tense situation: For months, law enforcement officials have been cracking down on protests against the training center.
Kamau Franklin, a community organizer in Atlanta, said on Friday that opponents of the center saw the latest arrests as part of a larger bid to chill protests and scare would-be activists out of being involved in social justice movements. "We're in dangerous times," he said. "Law enforcement is now attacking the very infrastructure of organization and movement politics."
But officials contended that the arrests reflected something far more sinister: "These criminals facilitated and encouraged domestic terrorism," said Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp.
The charges should be seen as a potent reminder that "we will track down every member of a criminal organization, from violent foot soldiers to their uncaring leaders," Mr. Kemp said in a statement on Wednesday. "We will not rest until they are arrested, tried and face punishment."
The conflicting reactions to the charges are an extension of a broader disconnect in Atlanta between opponents and supporters of the planned police complex, as an effort to stop the construction of the training center amid a 1,000-acre stretch of urban forest land escalated into violent clashes in the woods, leading to the fatal shooting of one activist and domestic terrorism charges against many protesters.
The three people arrested -- Marlon Kautz, 39; Savannah Patterson, 30; and Adele MacLean, 42 -- made an initial court appearance on Friday. Bail for each of them was set at $ 15,000. But Judge James Altman expressed some skepticism about the state's case. "I don't find it real impressive," he told prosecutors during the hearing, adding that "there's not a lot of meat on the bones of thousands of dollars going to illegal activities."
The three have been accused, according to arrest warrants, of misleading donors by spending money to support Defend the Atlanta Forest, a group that has been blamed by local authorities for the arson and vandalism of buildings and heavy equipment during protests, and for throwing Molotov cocktails, rocks and fireworks at uniformed police officers.
The warrants listed specific reimbursements to the three from Mr. Kautz's charity, registered as the Network for Strong Communities, which runs the Atlanta Solidarity Fund: $ 298.54 to Mr. Kautz for mesh communications equipment to monitor the forest, $ 115.80 to Ms. Patterson for camping supplies, and $ 29.72 to Ms. McLean for a safe bought from Amazon, among other expenses.
The authorities also noted that $ 48,000 had been transferred by the Network for Strong Communities to another organization, which then returned the money -- actions that prosecutors said constituted money laundering.
During the hearing, prosecutors said that the defendants' work might appear lawful, even laudable, but that their money had helped fund destructive acts, including violent protests related to the training facility and vandalizing Ebenezer Baptist Church, the storied Atlanta congregation led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Raphael Warnock.
John Fowler, a deputy attorney general, also said that they "harbor extremist anti-government and anti-establishment views." (The case is being prosecuted by the Georgia attorney general's office and the district attorney for DeKalb County.)
But Donald Samuel, a lawyer for the three defendants, said they had done nothing wrong. "The notion that the solidarity fund should be somehow responsible for everything that goes over the line seems unbelievably unjust to me," he said on Friday.
The Atlanta Solidarity Fund, the group that the three are associated with, said it saw the charges as an effort to hamper protesters' ability to access legal aid.
Legal experts said that prosecutors could face significant hurdles as the case moved forward. Charitable organizations have First Amendment rights, and they routinely reimburse people for expenses like the ones cited in the arrest affidavits. The Network for Strong Communities lists the bail fund, pursuing police accountability and training community activists among its initiatives. To prove fraud, prosecutors would have to show that donations were used for other purposes.
"It's a stretch to use what are white-collar financial fraud claims to charge these individuals, but obviously they want them charged," said Randy Chartash, a former federal prosecutor of white-collar crime who is now a criminal defense lawyer in Atlanta. Still, he said, it is common for prosecutors to bring unrelated charges such as tax evasion against someone they believe to be involved in crime.
Money laundering in this context would typically refer to an attempt to conceal the source of funds or the use of funds to promote criminal activity, Mr. Chartash said, adding, "This will be a difficult case to prove."
But the arrests have also stoked concerns that reach beyond the case itself. Josh McLaurin, a Democratic state senator representing an Atlanta suburb, called the raid "reckless," saying, "The situation is already at a fever pitch."
The fight over the stretch of woodland, an old prison farm that had been reclaimed by nature, has gone on for nearly two years.
Plans for the roughly $ 90 million facility include areas for police trainees to learn vehicle skills, as well as a nightclub, a convenient store and homes, all intended to better prepare officers but also lift a police force that has been depleted of morale and manpower in recent years.
The development has been challenged not just by activists opposed to the aggressive police tactics and increased militarization of police forces that they argue the facility will support, but also by environmental advocates who want to protect a rare remaining expanse of green space near Atlanta.
Tensions came to a head during a violent confrontation between protesters and law enforcement officers in January, when a 26-year-old environmental activist named Manuel Esteban Paez Terán was fatally shot and a state trooper was wounded.
Some of those concerned about the crackdown on protesters say that the debate over the training center has particular resonance in Atlanta because of the city's deep ties to the civil rights movement and the role of protests in shaping the city's identity.
"Because of our reputation, Atlanta has to set the bar in terms of what freedom of speech looks like," said Liliana Bakhtiari, a city councilor representing the area in East Atlanta where the three were arrested, and a critic of the planned facility. "The state's actions against us, and what they are conducting in our city, I find to be a direct threat to that legacy and to the spirit of what Atlanta is."
Chris Carr, the state attorney general, said Georgia would press forward in prosecuting cases related to the protests. "We will not rest," he said in a statement, "until we have held accountable every person who has funded, organized or participated in this violence and intimidation."
But Ruwa Romman, a Democratic state representative from Duluth, northeast of Atlanta, expressed a sense of exhaustion -- not just with the aggressive response to protesters, but also with the push to continue constructing the facility.
She said the project should have been paused after the shooting death of the activist, known as Tortuguita. "But," she said, "the only message that I'm seeing being told to law enforcement is that, 'No matter what you do, we will make sure you get whatever you need, at all costs."'

Justices Rule Law Doesn't Shield Union: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The justices ruled that federal labor law did not block state courts from ruling on a case regarding damage caused when workers walked off the job.
The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that federal labor law did not protect a union from potential liability for damage that arose during a strike, and that a state court should resolve questions of liability.
The majority found that if accusations by an employer are true, actions during a strike by a local Teamsters union were not even arguably protected by federal law because the union took "affirmative steps to endanger" the employer's property "rather than reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk." It asked the state court to decide the merits of the accusations.
The opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Three conservative justices backed more sweeping concurring opinions. A single justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented.
Some legal experts had said a union setback in the case would discourage workers from striking by making the union potentially liable for losses that an employer incurred during a work stoppage.
"It will definitely lead to more expensive-to-resolve lawsuits against labor unions," said Charlotte Garden, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who was an author of a brief in support of the union. Professor Garden did note, however, that the decision was less far-reaching in discouraging strike activity than it could have been.
Others have argued that the ruling was necessary to prevent workers from intentionally harming an employer's property, an act not protected by federal labor law, and that such restrictions do not jeopardize the right to strike.
"Damages from intentional destruction of property are not inherent to the act of striking," said Michael O'Neill of the Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative legal advocacy group that submitted a brief in the case. As a result, Mr. O'Neill said, the law does not shield workers or unions from liability for such damage.
The case, Glacier Northwest v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, No. 21-1449, involved unionized employees of a concrete mixing and pouring company who walked off the job during contract negotiations, leaving wet concrete in their trucks. The employer argued that it suffered substantial monetary losses because the abandoned concrete was unusable.
The union argued that it had taken reasonable steps to avoid harming the employer's property, as federal law requires, because workers kept their trucks running as they walked off the job. That allowed the company to dispose of the concrete without damage to the trucks. The union said the lost concrete amounted to the spoilage of a product, for which unions were not typically held liable.
At issue were two key questions. The first was procedural: whether the case should be allowed to go forward in state court, as employers generally prefer. The alternative is that the state court -- in this case, Washington -- should step aside in favor of the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency responsible for resolving labor disputes.
The second question was about what economic damage is acceptable during a strike, and what amounts to vandalism -- which federal labor law does not protect -- of property or equipment.
The two issues are linked because under legal precedent, the labor board is supposed to elbow aside state courts when the alleged actions during the strike are at least "arguably protected" by federal law.
The Supreme Court ruled that the union's actions, as alleged by the employer, were not arguably protected because the spoilage of the product was not merely an indirect result of the strike. Instead, the employer contended in a lawsuit, "the drivers prompted the creation of the perishable product" and then waited until the concrete was inside the trucks before walking off the job.
"In so doing, they not only destroyed the concrete but also put Glacier's trucks in harm's way," the majority opinion said. It sent the case back to Washington State court to be litigated.
Sean M. O'Brien, the president of the Teamsters, issued a defiant statement after the decision was announced. "The Teamsters will strike any employer, when necessary, no matter their size or the depth of their pockets," he said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the court "got it right" in ruling that federal law "does not pre-empt state tort claims against a union for intentional destruction of an employer's property during a labor dispute."
In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas agreed that the Washington State court should be allowed to take up the case. He wrote that in a future case, the Supreme Court should reconsider whether the National Labor Relations Board should have such wide latitude to take the first pass in such cases.
Justice Jackson noted in her dissent that the labor board had issued its own complaint since the case was first filed in Washington State. In issuing its complaint, the labor board's general counsel found that the strike activity was in fact protected. This by definition meant that the activity was "arguably protected," Justice Jackson wrote, requiring the state court to stand down.
The decision, which some experts said could cause unions to reconsider striking or take a more cautious approach when a perishable product could be harmed, followed a series of rulings that appeared to scale back the power of unions and workers.
The court ruled in 2018 that companies could prohibit workers from collectively bringing legal actions against their employers, even though the National Labor Relations Act protects workers' rights to engage in so-called concerted activities.
In the same year, the court ruled that public-sector unions could no longer require nonmembers to pay fees that help fund bargaining and other activities that unions do on their behalf.
In 2021, the court deemed unconstitutional a California regulation that gave unions access to agricultural employers' property for recruitment.
In interviews, union leaders said that the ruling on Thursday would further tilt an already uneven playing field toward employers, and that it was often not a strike itself but the threat of a strike that helped unions win concessions.
"Without the threat of a strike, you have little leverage in negotiations," said Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has organized successful strikes.
Mr. O'Neill's group, the Landmark Legal Foundation, argued that a ruling against the employer could have jeopardized the labor peace that the National Labor Relations Act was enacted to assure, "placing workers and the public at risk" by essentially blessing acts of vandalism and sabotage.
Unions and workers often deliberately plan strikes to exploit employers' vulnerability -- for example, Amazon workers walked out during the holiday season -- and rely on an element of surprise to maximize the economic harm they inflict, and therefore the leverage the union gains.
In the near term, unions that are contemplating strikes or already striking, such as unions representing Hollywood writers or United Parcel Service employees whose contract expires this summer, may have to take greater precautions to insulate themselves from legal liability.
Such precautions will typically weaken the impact of strikes, said Ms. Garden, the University of Minnesota professor. "You could get unions prophylactically adopting less effective tactics -- things like giving advance warning about strike, which gives the employer a lot more time to hire replacement workers," she said.
Other unions may simply decide not to strike at all out of fear of heightened legal exposure, she said.
Further out, unions and their political allies may seek to enact legislation that explicitly exempts workers from liability for certain types of economic damage that arise during a strike.
"There will be efforts in blue states to make the best of it, to do something protective," said Sharon Block, a former Biden and Obama administration official who is a professor of practice at Harvard Law School.
But even these laws could wind up being challenged before the Supreme Court, experts said.

The Real Reason Your Groceries Are Getting So Expensive: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Food Fresh is the only grocery store in a rural stretch of southeastern Georgia. It has many five-star Google reviews praising its freshly butchered meats, tomato bar and friendly service. Yet it faces a threat to its survival that no amount of management skill can overcome. Big retailers like Walmart and Kroger "have a handle on suppliers that I can't touch," said Food Fresh's owner, Michael Gay. The chains wrest deep discounts from suppliers, making it impossible for the store to come close to matching the chains' prices.
To understand why grocery prices are way up, we need to look past the headlines about inflation and reconsider long-held ideas about the benefits of corporate bigness.
Like other independent grocers, Food Fresh buys through large national wholesalers that purchase goods by the truckload, achieving the same volume efficiencies the big chains do. What accounts for the difference in price is not efficiency but raw market power. Major grocery suppliers, including Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Clorox, rely on Walmart for more than 20 percent of their sales. So when Walmart demands special deals, suppliers can't say no. And as suppliers cut special deals for Walmart and other large chains, they make up for the lost revenue by charging smaller retailers even more, something economists refer to as the water bed effect.
This isn't competition. It's big retailers exploiting their financial control over suppliers to hobble smaller competitors. Our failure to put a stop to it has warped our entire food system. It has driven independent grocers out of business and created food deserts. It has spurred consolidation among food processors, which has slashed the share of food dollars going to farmers and created dangerous bottlenecks in the production of meat and other essentials. And in a perverse twist, it has raised food prices for everyone, no matter where you shop.
A level playing field was long a tenet of U.S. antitrust policy. In the 19th century, Congress barred railroads from favoring some shippers over others. It applied this principle to retailing in 1936 with the Robinson-Patman Act, which mandates that suppliers offer the same terms to all retailers. The act allows large retailers to claim discounts based on actual volume efficiencies but blocks them from extracting deals that aren't also made available to their competitors. For roughly four decades, the Federal Trade Commission vigorously enforced the act. From 1954 to 1965, the agency issued 81 cease-and-desist orders to stop suppliers of milk, tea, oatmeal, candy and other foods from giving preferential prices to the largest grocery chains.
As a result, the grocery retailing sector was enviable by today's standards. Independent grocery stores flourished, accounting for more than half of food sales in 1958. Supermarket chains like Safeway and Kroger also thrived. This dynamism fed a broad prosperity. Even the smallest towns and poorest neighborhoods could generally count on having a grocery store. And the industry's diffuse structure ensured that its fruits were widely distributed. Of the nearly nine million people working in retailing overall in the mid-1950s, nearly two million owned or co-owned the store where they worked. There were more Black-owned grocery stores in 1969 than there are today.
Then, amid the economic chaos and inflation of the late 1970s, the law fell into disfavor with regulators, who had come to believe that allowing large retailers to flex more muscle over suppliers would lower consumer prices. For the most part, the law hasn't been enforced since. As a top Reagan administration official explained in 1981, antitrust was no longer "concerned with fairness to smaller competitors."
This was a serious miscalculation. Walmart, which seized the opening and soon became notorious for strong-arming suppliers and undercutting local businesses, now captures one in four dollars Americans spend on groceries. Its rise spurred a cascade of supermarket mergers, as other chains sought to match its leverage over suppliers. If the latest of these mergers -- Kroger's bid to buy Albertsons -- goes through, just five retailers will control about 55 percent of grocery sales. Food processors in turn sought to counterbalance the retailers by merging. Supermarket aisles may seem to brim with variety, but most of the brands you see are made by just a few conglomerates.
These food giants are now the dominant buyers of crops and livestock. The lack of competition has contributed to the decline in farmers' share of the consumer grocery dollar, which has fallen by more than half since the 1980s. In the absence of rivals, food conglomerates have over time increasingly been able to raise prices and as a result have reported soaring profits over the past two years. Inflation gives them a cover story, but it's the lack of competition that allows them to get away with it. Meat prices surged last year among the four companies that control most pork, beef and poultry processing. Companies like PepsiCo and General Mills have also jacked up prices without seeing any loss of sales -- a sure sign of uncontested market power.
This has resulted in an ever-worsening cycle: As a system dominated by a few retailers lifts prices across the board -- even at Walmart -- consumers head to those retailers because of their ability to wrest relatively lower prices or simply because they're the only options left. Walmart's share of grocery sales swelled last year as more people flocked to its stores.
Meanwhile, the decline of independent grocers, which disproportionately serve rural small towns and Black and Latino neighborhoods, has left debilitating gaps in our food system. If Food Fresh were to close, residents of Evans County, where the store is, would have to subsist on the limited range of packaged foods sold at a local dollar store or drive about 25 minutes to reach a Walmart. (Nearly a quarter of Evans County residents live in poverty.) Living without a grocery store nearby imposes a daily hardship on people and could lead to an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and other diet-related illnesses.
Losing small retailers also stifles innovation. New food companies rely on independent retailers to introduce products. But as this diversity of retailers gives way to a monocrop of big chains, start-ups have fewer avenues to success. This results in diminished selection for shoppers, who find store shelves stocked with only what the big food conglomerates choose to produce.
We need to stop big retailers from using their enormous financial leverage over suppliers to tilt the playing field. By resurrecting the Robinson-Patman Act, we could begin to put an end to decades of misguided antitrust policy in which regulators abandoned fair competition in favor of ever-greater corporate scale. There is promising momentum. Last year an unusual coalition of Democratic and Republican lawmakers sent a letter to the F.T.C. urging it to dust off Robinson-Patman. The agency began a broad inquiry in late 2021 into grocery supply issues, which could uncover evidence of price discrimination. This year the agency opened investigations into soft drink and alcohol suppliers for possible violations of the act.
These moves are already drawing fire from an old guard locked in bigger-is-always-better thinking. Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who served as a top adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted recently that some of the views calling for a reset of our antitrust policies often seem "grounded less in consumer welfare and more in a view that everyone should be shopping at expensive craft boutiques." But that's not the story in places like Evans County. In the early days of the pandemic, as Walmart and Amazon compelled manufacturers to steer scarce supplies their way and worsened shortages at local grocers, Mr. Gay worked long days hustling to find alternate sources.
"My meat is fresher," he said. "My produce is fresher. My customer service is better. Imagine if you made the playing field level. Imagine what I could do."

Predawn Picketing by Writers Brings Some Hollywood Productions to a Halt: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Workers from other unions have shown solidarity with the strikers, catching entertainment companies off guard.
At 5 a.m. on a recent weekday, a lone figure paced back and forth outside the main entrance to the Fox Studios lot in Los Angeles. Peter Chiarelli, a screenwriter, was walking the picket line.
He held a sign reading "Thank You 399," a message to the local branch of the Teamsters union, whose members he hoped would turn their trucks around instead of crossing his personal picket line to enter the lot, where Hulu was filming the series "Interior Chinatown."
"It's passive-aggressive," Mr. Chiarelli, who wrote the films "Crazy Rich Asians" and "The Proposal," said of his sentiment -- sincere if the Teamsters turned back and sarcastic if they entered.
Since the Hollywood writers' strike began on May 2, Mr. Chiarelli and others like him have been waking before dawn to try to disrupt productions whose scripts had already been finished.
"We need to shut down the pipeline," he said of the shows in production.
The practice, which was not used to any real effect when the writers last went on strike in 2007, initially caught some studio executives off guard. And many of them -- as well as plenty of people in the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents the writers -- have been surprised that it has had some success.
Showtime paused production on the sixth season of "The Chi" after writers gathered for two straight days outside the gates of the Chicago studio where it was filming. Apple TV's "Loot" shut down after writers picketed a Los Angeles mansion where filming was taking place. The show's star, Maya Rudolph, retreated to her trailer and was unwilling to return to set.
Over 20 writers trekked from Los Angeles to Santa Clarita, Calif., to picket the FX drama "The Old Man," starring Jeff Bridges. The overnight action kept Teamsters trucks inside the Blue Cloud Movie Ranch, Mr. Chiarelli said, and crews had difficulty working. The show soon suspended production.
A Lionsgate comedy starring Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogen, with Aziz Ansari making his debut as a movie director, shut down last week after just two and a half days of filming in locations around Los Angeles after loud, shouting writers picketed all three of its sets.
"While we won't discuss the specifics of our strategy, we're applying pressure on the companies by disrupting production wherever it takes place," a Writers Guild of America spokesman said in a statement.
Eric Haywood, a veteran writer who is on the union's negotiating committee, put it more plainly. "If your movie or TV show is still shooting and we haven't shut it down yet, sit tight," he wrote on social media last weekend. "We'll get around to you."
A representative for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, declined to comment.
Both sides have privately said a much greater sense of solidarity among unions than during the last writers' strike has made it harder for workers from other unions to cross picket lines. Productions are also more geographically widespread than they were 15 years ago. In addition to fortified Los Angeles soundstages, writers have picketed locations in the New Jersey suburbs, New York's Westchester County and Chicago. And social media has provided a way to alert writers to quickly get to specific picket lines.
Each day, the writers send out calls for "rapid response teams" when they learn about a production's call time and location.
"Breaking: they're shooting on Sunday ... we're picketing on Sunday," a writer posted on Twitter, asking people to get together immediately in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn to disrupt a production. "Please amplify."
"I think everybody is getting behind us because they see that if we all stick together, we can make some real achievements," said Mike Royce ("One Day at a Time"), who has joined Mr. Chiarelli in his some of his predawn pickets.
The writers have disrupted other events as well. Netflix canceled a major in-person presentation for advertisers in New York amid concerns about demonstrations. The streaming company also canceled an appearance by Ted Sarandos, one of its co-chief executives, who was to be honored at the prestigious PEN America Literary Gala. A Boston University commencement address by David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, was interrupted by boos and chants of "Pay your writers!" from demonstrators and students.
While the makeshift picket lines have disrupted individual productions, it's not clear that they've had much effect on the strike itself. Negotiations haven't resumed since they broke down on May 1, and the industry is bracing for the possibility that the strike could last for months.
The writers contend that their wages have stagnated even though the major Hollywood studios have invested billions of dollars in recent years to build out their streaming services. The guild has described the dispute in stark terms, saying the "survival of writing as a profession is at stake."
But production shutdowns are affecting not only the studios. Crews and other workers -- like drivers, set designers, caterers -- lose paychecks. And if the shutdowns accumulate and more people are unable to work, some wonder whether the writers will begin to erode the current good will from other workers.
Lindsay Dougherty is the lead organizer of Local 399, the Teamsters' Los Angeles division, which represents more than 6,000 movie workers, from the truck drivers the writers are trying to turn away to casting directors, location managers and animal trainers. A second-generation Teamster, Ms. Dougherty is one of the union's few female leaders. Her copious tattoos, including one of the former Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa, and her frequently profane speech have made her a bit of a celebrity to the writers during the strike.
And she said the solidarity with the writers remained strong.
"I think collectively, we're all on the same page in that streaming has dramatically changed the industry," Ms. Dougherty said in an interview. "And these tech companies that we're bargaining with, during the last writers' strike -- Amazon, Apple, Netflix -- they weren't even part of the conversation."
Asked if the Teamsters were tipping off the writers about the timing and location of productions, she demurred.
"The Writers Guild is getting tips from all sorts of different places -- whether it's members that are working on the crew, or from film permits, they obviously have social media groups and emails set up to send tips and information," she said.
In the meantime, Mr. Chiarelli keeps pacing outside Fox Studios each day, hoping he can turn some trucks around. Some days he gets results. On a recent morning he was joined by several other writers, and five trucks turned away, he said. During an overnight picket at Fox, a trailer carrying fake police cars destined for the shoot turned tail at 2 a.m.
Other days, the picket line is much more sparse, especially if a tip takes a group to a different location.
He and Mr. Royce talked fondly about their second day out in the darkness. It was pouring rain when two large trucks pulled into the turn lane, blinkers on, ready to enter the lot. Then they saw the writers. The trucks pulled to the side of the road, waited about 10 minutes, then turned around.
They "blew past the entrance, honked their horns and waved at us," Mr. Royce said. "It was thrilling."
Added Mr. Chiarelli, "I've been chasing that high ever since."

For Her Book, a High Score: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Gabrielle Zevin didn't expect a wide audience for "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow," her novel about game developers. It became a blockbuster with staying power.
Five and a half years ago, Gabrielle Zevin was in a slump. She had recently published her ninth novel, and sales were sluggish.
She needed a distraction, so she turned, as she often does, to video games. But when she tried to play the adventure game Gold Rush, she discovered that the version she had played obsessively as a kid no longer existed. It felt like a chapter of her childhood had been erased. "This part of my life was gone," she said.
The feeling of loss yielded a kernel of an idea, which Zevin jotted in a notebook: "Story of two game designers. The games they make are their lives."
Those two sentences eventually grew into her latest novel, "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow," which follows two video game developers who endure creative highs and lows that parallel Zevin's own meandering path as a novelist.
Zevin had initially figured that there wouldn't be much of an audience for a literary novel set in the world of game development. So she was elated last summer when the novel became a word-of-mouth phenomenon, fueled by passionate independent booksellers, book clubs and zealous fans posting on social media.
Even more surprising than the novel's breakout success is its staying power. "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow," which came out in July, has remained on the New York Times best-seller list for 33 weeks and sold more than a million copies globally. So far this year, it has sold some 575,000 copies in the United States, outpacing last year's sales of 300,000. It has racked up around 175,000 five-star ratings on Goodreads and roughly 28,000 on Amazon. It is currently the No. 3 best-selling adult hardcover fiction title of 2023, according to Circana BookScan.
The relentless buzz has put Zevin in an odd position as a midcareer novelist. Even though "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" is not her first book, or even her first to be a best seller, many readers are coming to her work for the first time. (Oprah Daily mistakenly called it "one of the year's most ingenious debuts.")
"When someone has a breakout moment like this, people are always like, 'Oh, you appeared out of nowhere'," said the novelist Celeste Ng, who praised the book as "a page turner but also, really, this technical marvel."
"She didn't come out of nowhere," Ng said.
Zevin has been publishing at a frenetic pace for nearly two decades, and yet she has rarely repeated herself. Since her debut in 2005, she has written a family drama about war and capitalism, a futuristic dystopian series for young adults, a fablelike Y.A. novel about the afterlife, a quirky novel about a cranky bookseller who unexpectedly finds love and a bitingly funny one about politics, sexism and the double standards women face for sexual indiscretions.
"She has had it all in her career, she's had a global smash, but she's also had books that absolutely failed to connect for whatever reason," said Emma Straub, a novelist and an owner of the independent Brooklyn store Books Are Magic, where "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" has been the top-selling title this year. "For those of us on the backside of 40 who have half a dozen books under our belts, this is so beautiful to watch. She is operating at the height of her powers, and people are noticing."
Growing up in Boca Raton, Fla., where both of her parents worked for I.B.M., Zevin was lonely most of the time. The only child of a Korean American mother and a Jewish father, she often felt culturally adrift and out of place. One day, her father, a programmer, brought home a computer loaded with games, including Alley Cat, in which the player is a mischievous cat who jumps through windows into different apartments. "I remember thinking that the game solved a very particular problem for me, which was the problem of solitude," she said. "It became like an instant friend."
From there, she discovered games like King's Quest IV and Oregon Trail, which felt like immersive worlds she could disappear into. "These were really formative stories for me," she said.
She majored in English at Harvard University, where she met her partner, the director Hans Canosa. After graduating, they moved to New York. Zevin worked furiously on film scripts and plays. One day, she had an idea that didn't seem right for any of those formats. It became her novel "Elsewhere," about a teenage girl who dies in a bike accident and wakes up in an afterlife where people age backward until they are reborn. Around the same time, she had the idea for "Margarettown," a surreal novel about a young man whose love for a woman named Margaret draws him into an alternate world.
Both novels were published in 2005, when Zevin was 27, but they had wildly different trajectories. Critics praised "Margarettown," which Miramax Books published as an adult novel, but it failed commercially, selling around 4,200 print copies, according to Circana BookScan. "Elsewhere," a young adult novel that Farrar, Straus and Giroux released several months later, went on to sell more than 350,000 copies.
Over the next eight years, Zevin wrote at a frenetic pace. She published another young-adult novel and a futuristic Y.A. trilogy, and she spent years working on another literary novel, "The Hole We're In," about a family struggling with financial debt. But nothing matched the commercial success of "Elsewhere."
Then, in 2014, Zevin released "The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry," a love letter to literary culture that centers on an ornery bookstore owner with narrow taste whose horizons are expanded when he falls in love. For reasons that still mystify Zevin, it became a global blockbuster, selling more than 850,000 copies in the United States and more than four million worldwide. It was adapted into a feature film in 2022 that was based on a screenplay Zevin wrote, with Canosa, her partner, as the director.
Again, it seemed like Zevin's breakout moment, and again, success proved fleeting. Three years later, when she published "Young Jane Young," about a congressional intern who is publicly shamed for having an affair with her boss, it drew strong reviews but sold fewer than 10,000 hardcover copies.
Zevin wallowed for a bit, unsure of what to do next. When she had the idea for a novel about game designers in late 2017, she worried that she wouldn't be able to pull it off. Even though she had played video games all her life, she knew next to nothing about how they were made.
"It seemed that the subject was so vast, and I knew that if it were to work, it would have to be probably better than anything I had done before," she said.
She spent years researching the novel, which spans some three decades in the lives of Sam and Sadie. They bond over video games as children and then build a successful company together, making increasingly sophisticated games as technology improves.
Zevin read books about gaming culture and design and watched gamers on YouTube and the livestreaming service Twitch. She played old video games like the original Super Mario Bros. and newer ones that she wouldn't normally be drawn to, like first-person shooter games and immersed herself in cinematic-quality ones like The Last of Us. During the hours she spent playing, she was often struck by the games' narrative complexity and ability to conjure empathy.
A few times, Zevin almost abandoned the book, worried that the subject wouldn't resonate with a wide audience.
When her literary agent, Douglas Stewart, sent out the manuscript in January 2021, he felt in some ways as if he were introducing her for the first time. "Despite the fact that Gabrielle had several big successes before, there are people who had never heard of her before this," he said.
A frenzied bidding war with 10 publishers broke out, and Knopf won, paying a seven-figure advance. Shortly after, an auction for screen rights drew 25 bidders, and Paramount Pictures bought them for $ 2 million. Foreign rights sold in 37 territories. Zevin went on "The Tonight Show" with Jimmy Fallon.
The novel landed on the New York Times best-seller list at No. 3 in July and stayed for eight weeks before dropping off. Then, in December, critics' best-of-2022 lists gave the novel a second life, and it sailed back onto the best-seller lists. Knopf, which initially printed 60,000 copies, has reprinted the book 21 times to keep up with runaway sales. This spring, big stores like Walmart and Target, as well as some grocery chains, started carrying it for the first time.
Zevin, who lives in Los Angeles with Canosa and their dogs, Frank, a pug mix, and Leia, a dachshund mix, is writing the screenplay for "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow," a project that presents new narrative challenges.
Looking back, Zevin said she felt fortunate that she was able to carve such an eclectic path, without confining herself to a particular niche.
"I've had enough successes," she said, "to balance out the failures over the years."

It was adapted into a feature film in 2022 that was based on a screenplay Zevin wrote, with Canosa, her partner, as the director.
Again, it seemed like Zevin’s breakout moment, and again, success proved fleeting. Three years later, when she published “Young Jane Young,” about a congressional intern who is publicly shamed for having an affair with her boss, it drew strong reviews but sold fewer than 10,000 hardcover copies.
Zevin wallowed for a bit, unsure of what to do next. When she had the idea for a novel about game designers in late 2017, she worried that she wouldn’t be able to pull it off. Even though she had played video games all her life, she knew next to nothing about how they were made.
“It seemed that the subject was so vast, and I knew that if it were to work, it would have to be probably better than anything I had done before,” she said.
She spent years researching the novel, which spans some three decades in the lives of Sam and Sadie. They bond over video games as children and then build a successful company together, making increasingly sophisticated games as technology improves.
Zevin read books about gaming culture and design and watched gamers on YouTube and the livestreaming service Twitch. She played old video games like the original Super Mario Bros. and newer ones that she wouldn’t normally be drawn to, like first-person shooter games, and immersed herself in cinematic-quality ones like The Last of Us. During the hours she spent playing, she was often struck by the games’ narrative complexity and ability to conjure empathy.
A few times, Zevin almost abandoned the book, worried that the subject wouldn’t resonate with a wide audience.
When her literary agent, Douglas Stewart, sent out the manuscript in January 2021, he felt in some ways as if he were introducing her for the first time. “Despite the fact that Gabrielle had several big successes before, there are people who had never heard of her before this,” he said.
A frenzied bidding war with 10 publishers broke out, and Knopf won, paying a seven-figure advance. Shortly after, an auction for screen rights drew 25 bidders, and Paramount Pictures bought them for $2 million. Foreign rights sold in 37 territories. Zevin went on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon.
The novel landed on the New York Times bestseller list at No. 3 in July and stayed for eight weeks before dropping off. Then, in December, critics’ best-of-2022 lists gave the novel a second life, and it sailed back onto the bestseller lists. Knopf, which initially printed 60,000 copies, has reprinted the book 21 times to keep up with runaway sales. This spring, big stores like Walmart and Target, as well as some grocery chains, started carrying it for the first time.
Zevin, who lives in Los Angeles with Canosa and their dogs, Frank, a pug mix, and Leia, a dachshund mix, is writing the screenplay for “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,” a project that presents new narrative challenges.
Looking back, Zevin said she felt fortunate that she was able to carve such an eclectic path, without confining herself to a particular niche.
“I’ve had enough successes,” she said, “to balance out the failures over the years.”

Peru's Security Forces Face Little Scrutiny As Protesters Die: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Peru, investigations into the killing of protesters by security forces are often closed without any charges, undermining people's faith in their government.
In the adobe house she built with her husband in a small village in Peru, Antonia Huillca pulled out a stack of documents that once represented a glimmer of hope.
They were part of an investigation into the death of her husband, Quintino Cereceda, who left one morning in 2016 to join a protest against a new copper mine and never returned.
Ms. Huillca can't read, but she can identify a photo of her husband's body, a bullet wound to his forehead; the question-and-answer format in which police officers describe firing live ammunition as protesters threw rocks; the logo of the mining company sending convoys of trucks over unpaved roads, sparking protests among villagers fed up with the dust.
But today, the investigation has gone cold.
"All these years and no justice," Ms. Huillca, a 51-year-old Quechua farmer, said as a storm gathered over her village, Choquecca, in Peru's southern Andes. "It's as if we don't exist."
For years, scores of similar cases in Peru have met a familiar fate: Investigations into the killing of unarmed civilians at protests where security forces were deployed, most of them in poor Indigenous and rural areas, are opened when they attract headlines, only to be closed quietly later, with officials often citing a lack of evidence.
Now, the unusually high death toll during antigovernment demonstrations after the removal of the country's president last year has put accusations of abuse by security officials in the global spotlight, raising questions about why so many previous killings remain unsolved.
At least 49 civilians were killed in clashes with the police or military during protests after President Pedro Castillo was impeached last December when he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, according to figures from the country's ombudsman's office.
A New York Times investigation in March found that in three towns where deadly clashes occurred, the police and soldiers had fired shotguns at civilians using lethal ammunition, shot assault rifles at fleeing protesters and killed unarmed people, often in apparent violation of their own protocols.
"We went through the same thing," said José Cárdenas, whose younger brother, Alberto, was killed in 2015 in clashes with the police during protests that also targeted a copper mine. "My brother didn't die in an accident. He was shot."
So far, an investigation has not led to any charges.
A lack of accountability for excessive use of force by security agencies is a serious human rights failure, according to civil rights organizations, undermining people's faith in the authorities.
In Peru, more than 200 civilians have been killed in police and military crackdowns on protests in the past two decades, according to a list compiled by the National Human Rights Coordinator, an advocacy group.
Yet, over that same period, prosecutors have not won a single conviction against police or military officers or their superiors for killings at protests, according to human rights activists, lawyers and two state prosecutors who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.
In most cases, investigations do not even lead to a trial, they said, adding that, instead, demonstrators and protest leaders are accused of vandalism or inciting public disorder.
"It's backwards -- when it's about punishing campesinos they move fast," said David Velazco, a human rights lawyer who has defended more than 200 rural protesters on various charges, including vandalism and disturbing the public order.
The prime minister's office and the national prosecutor's office did not respond to multiple requests for comment, while the Interior Ministry declined to answer questions.
The country's current president, Dina Boluarte, who took over after Mr. Castillo was ousted, has blamed the deadly clashes on protesters who have blocked roads and attacked security forces with rocks and slingshots.
Investigations involving clashes in rural areas can be challenging, legal analysts say, partly because it can be hard to determine whether the police face a legitimate threat to their lives when they are outnumbered by protesters, said Rolando Luque, who monitors conflicts in the ombudsman's office.
"At some point, while carrying out their duties, they could be" overtaken by protesters," he said, and "they could be killed with their own weapons."
That is what happened during a clash in the Amazon between protesters and the police in 2009 that left 23 officers and 10 civilians dead, said Mr. Luque, who witnessed the aftermath. The officers, he said, "were taken into the forest and executed."
Further complicating matters, the police and the military often refuse to share details about their operations, according to lawyers involved in cases of civilian deaths. And cases tend to be assigned to overworked prosecutors, some of whom manage more than 200 at a time.
Prosecutors have been reluctant to investigate top government officials who may have authorized or encouraged the use of lethal force, or the role of mining companies that hire the police to provide private security, human rights activists said.
"There's a clear lack of institutional will to tackle the issue," said Carlos Rivera, a human rights lawyer.
Peru is not the only South American democracy where unarmed civilians have been killed in protests as popular discontent has boiled over into the street.
Javier Puente, a scholar of Andean studies at Smith College in Massachusetts, said militaries and the police have long helped weak Latin American leaders make up for the lack of strong parties and other institutions, normalizing violent solutions to political problems.
"The price that Peru pays for the form of institutionalism that the military and the police offers is impunity," Mr. Puente said.
Peru's return to democracy in 2000 after years of authoritarian rule raised expectations of broader access to justice and political representation, along with an end to the police and military abuses of Peruvians, notably against Indigenous people.
Instead, as Peru experienced a rapid economic expansion, those hopes were left by the wayside.
One democratically elected president after another became mired in corruption scandals. Inequality remained high, social conflicts festered and a global commodities boom brought huge mining projects to rural Indigenous regions.
"They never listen to us. They just send in the police," said Melchor Yauri, a member of an Indigenous community in southern Peru.
He said his father, Félix, was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet by the police during a protest in 2012 over pollution from a copper mine and died from an infection to his wounds. An investigation into his death was closed in 2015.
Peru's police could be given greater immunity under a proposed congressional bill that would shift trials involving officers from civilian courts to a military-police court.
While neighboring countries, including Chile and Colombia, have elected leaders who promised changes to address excessive force, abuse and impunity in Peru seem to be growing more entrenched, said Will Freeman, a fellow in Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. research institute.
Ms. Boluarte and most lawmakers "don't even seem interested in pretending to put pressure behind accountability or reforms," Mr. Freeman said.
Days after nine civilians were killed in clashes with security forces in December, Ms. Boluarte promoted her defense minister to prime minister. Her administration has described the police's handling of protests as "impeccable" and proposed longer prison sentences for people who damage property or disrupt public order.
The relatives of victims of recent clashes say they do not trust the head of the prosecutor's office, Patricia Benavides, after she removed prosecutors who specialize in human rights violations from investigations and moved cases from rural areas to Lima, the capital, making it harder for family members to monitor their progress.
After her husband's death at the mining protest, Ms. Huillca said her herd of sheep dwindled to 30 from 500, as she has sold them off to support her children's education.
To this day, she freezes up when she sees the police. "I'm afraid they'll do the same thing to me," she said.

China-Tied Malware Hits Systems in Guam. Is Taiwan the Real Target?: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, set off alarms because Guam would be a centerpiece of any U.S. military response to a move against Taiwan.
Around the time that the F.B.I. was examining the equipment recovered from the Chinese spy balloon shot down off the South Carolina coast in February, American intelligence agencies and Microsoft detected what they feared was a more worrisome intruder: mysterious computer code appearing in telecommunications systems in Guam and elsewhere in the United States.
The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, raised alarms because Guam, with its Pacific ports and vast American air base, would be a centerpiece of any American military response to an invasion or blockade of Taiwan. The operation was conducted with great stealth, sometimes flowing through home routers and other common internet-connected consumer devices, to make the intrusion harder to track.
The code is called a "web shell," in this case a malicious script that enables remote access to a server. Home routers are particularly vulnerable, especially older models that have not had updated software and protections.
Unlike the balloon that fascinated Americans as it performed pirouettes over sensitive nuclear sites, the computer code could not be shot down on live television. So instead, Microsoft on Wednesday published details of the code that would make it possible for corporate users, manufacturers and others to detect and remove it. In a coordinated release, the National Security Agency -- along with other domestic agencies and counterparts in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Canada -- published a 24-page advisory that referred to Microsoft's finding and offered broader warnings about a "recently discovered cluster of activity" from China.
Microsoft called the hacking group "Volt Typhoon" and said that it was part of a state-sponsored Chinese effort aimed at not only critical infrastructure such as communications, electric and gas utilities, but also maritime operations and transportation. The intrusions appeared, for now, to be an espionage campaign. But the Chinese could use the code, which is designed to pierce firewalls, to enable destructive attacks, if they choose.
So far, Microsoft says, there is no evidence that the Chinese group has used the access for any offensive attacks. Unlike Russian groups, the Chinese intelligence and military hackers usually prioritize espionage.
In interviews, administration officials said they believed the code was part of a vast Chinese intelligence collection effort that spans cyberspace, outer space and, as Americans discovered with the balloon incident, the lower atmosphere.
The Biden administration has declined to discuss what the F.B.I. found as it examined the equipment recovered from the balloon. But the craft -- better described as a huge aerial vehicle -- apparently included specialized radars and communications interception devices that the F.B.I. has been examining since the balloon was shot down.
It is unclear whether the government's silence about its finding from the balloon is motivated by a desire to keep the Chinese government from knowing what the United States has learned or to get past the diplomatic breach that followed the incursion.
On Sunday, speaking at a news conference in Hiroshima, Japan, President Biden referred to how the balloon incident had paralyzed the already frosty exchanges between Washington and Beijing.
"And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars' worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States," he told reporters, "and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another."
He predicted that relations would "begin to thaw very shortly."
China has never acknowledged hacking into American networks, even in the biggest example of all: the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans -- including six million sets of fingerprints -- from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration of data took the better part of a year, and resulted in an agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity.
On Wednesday, China sent a warning to its companies to be alert to American hacking. And there has been plenty of that, too: In documents released by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, there was evidence of American efforts to hack into the systems of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and military and leadership targets.
Telecommunications networks are key targets for hackers, and the system in Guam is particularly important to China because military communications often piggyback on commercial networks.
Tom Burt, the executive who oversees Microsoft's threat intelligence unit, said in an interview that the company's analysts -- many of them veterans of the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies -- had found the code "while investigating intrusion activity impacting a U.S. port." As they traced back the intrusion, they found other networks that were hit, "including some in the telecommunications sector in Guam."
Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said that covert efforts "like the activity exposed today are part of what's driving our focus on the security of telecom networks and the urgency to use trusted vendors" whose equipment has met established cybersecurity standards.
Ms. Neuberger has been spearheading an effort across the federal government to enforce new cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure. Officials were taken by surprise by the extent of the vulnerabilities in such infrastructure when a Russian ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021 interrupted gasoline, diesel and airplane fuel flow on the East Coast. In the wake of the attack, the Biden administration used little-known powers of the Transportation Security Administration -- which regulates pipelines -- to force private-sector utilities to follow a series of cybersecurity mandates.
Now Ms. Neuberger is driving what she called a "relentless focus on improving the cybersecurity of our pipelines, rail systems, water systems and other critical services," including the mandates on cybersecurity practices for these sectors and closer collaboration with companies with "unique visibility" into threats to such infrastructure.
Those firms include Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and many telecommunications firms that can see activity on domestic networks. Intelligence agencies, including the N.S.A., are forbidden by law from operating inside the United States. But the N.S.A. is permitted to publish warnings, as it did on Wednesday, alongside the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Infrastructure and Security Administration.
The agency's report is part of a relatively new U.S. government move to publish such data quickly in hopes of burning operations like the one mounted by the Chinese government. In years past, the United States usually withheld such information -- sometimes classifying it -- and shared it with only a select few companies or organizations. But that almost always assured that the hackers could stay well ahead of the government.
In this case, it was the focus on Guam that particularly seized the attention of officials who are assessing China's capabilities -- and its willingness -- to attack or choke off Taiwan. Mr. Xi has ordered the People's Liberation Army to be capable of taking the island by 2027. But the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, has noted to Congress that the order "does not mean he has decided to conduct an invasion."
In the dozens of U.S. tabletop exercises conducted in recent years to map out what such an attack might look like, one of China's first anticipated moves would be to cut off American communications and slow the United States' ability to respond. So the exercises envision attacks on satellite and ground communications, especially around American installations where military assets would be mobilized.
None is bigger than Guam, where Andersen Air Force Base would be the launching point for many of the Air Force missions to help defend the island, and a Navy port is crucial for American submarines.

Full text: The idea for an office mahjong league came unexpectedly to Bella Janssens, the director of the architectural design firm Food New York, which has collaborated with Virgil Abloh, Axel Vervoordt and Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art. During a flight from Amsterdam in 2021, as post-pandemic travel resumed, she felt inspired while watching "The Joy Luck Club," the 1993 film adaptation of Amy Tan's 1989 novel, wherein the intermingling stories of four Chinese women and their daughters unfold over rounds of the four-player, tile-based game.
Though it originated in China in the 19th century, mahjong has long been popular throughout Southeast Asia, Japan and America; it was brought stateside by a Standard Oil company representative returning from Shanghai in the 1920s. Janssens, who's from the Netherlands but grew up between the United Kingdom and Singapore, decided she and her colleagues should start playing after meetings or during lunch in Food's Chinatown office; eventually, those pickup games grew into an amateur-friendly mahjong tournament that the firm's founding director, Dong-Ping Wong, 43, and Janssens, 34, have organized twice a year since late 2021. Wong, who was born and raised in San Diego, had a typical second-generation immigrant's relationship to mahjong. (His parents are from Hong Kong.) "I played it once, probably with my grandparents and great-aunts, and my memory was that I won that game," he says, "and only 30 years later did I realize they were probably just [messing] with me."
The first Food Mahjong Club, in December 2021, was a scrappy affair. Wong and Janssens didn't prepare much besides buying some mahjong sets, designing a logo and sending out invitations to friends and collaborators in the design, fashion and art worlds. By the third iteration, last September, the ad hoc gathering had become a ticketed event at a defunct dim sum parlor within the 88 East Broadway Mall that benefited the community-building nonprofit Welcome to Chinatown and drew some 150 people. "A lot of our work is trying to engage the public in some way," says Wong, noting that "a dream project for the office would be to build out a community center in Chinatown."
Here's how the most recent tournament came together one weeknight in March, as a few dozen people gathered at Food's headquarters to learn the game, compete, then socialize -- and eat dim sum -- once most of them had inevitably lost.
The hosts: Wong and Janssens have worked together for more than five years at Food New York, where Janssens handles operations and Wong leads design. After shepherding the game's novices toward beginner tables and introducing acquaintances to one another, Wong served as the tournament's M.C., counting down rounds ("Twenty seconds to choose a winner!") and guiding those who advanced to their designated tables. Wong's punctiliousness was a lesson learned from lingerers at the first Food Mahjong Club, when games went long over schedule. "Now I'm yelling at people to 'get up!' and 'move over there!' and 'finish your game!"' he says with a laugh.
The rules: This tournament began with 32 players. After a quarter- and semifinal round, the remaining four players (the creative strategist Brendan Chareoncharutkun, the producer Wei-Li Wang, the casting director Najia Li Saad and -- completely coincidentally -- this writer), played for a prize of a new mahjong set, which ultimately went to Wang. Food Mahjong Club plays a Cantonese version of the game, in which players begin with 13 tiles and win by completing a 14-tile hand of four three-tile sets (called melds, similar to hands in poker) and one pair called eyes. Cantonese style is regarded as the easiest for beginners, as opposed to, say, Taiwanese style, which requires winning with a 16-tile hand and has more complicated scoring conventions. For nonspeakers, Wong and Janssens also designed cards that translated the Chinese symbols for numerical characters and necessary vocabulary: pong when a player nabs three of a kind, or tingpai when they're one tile away from victory (the Mandarin equivalent of "uno").
The venue: The game took place at Food's headquarters off Chatham Square, a ninth-floor studio that fits only six square tables, with just enough space to cram in extra stools for spectators, a buffet for food and drink and some standing room for those more focused on industry gossip. Wong and Janssens set the mood with red lights that evoked a Wong Kar-wai film (or an "underground parlor," as Wong says), though the exact shade took trial and error. "The lights were sort of orangy and blue before we switched to red and pink, which helped it look coherent," Janssens says. "You couldn't tell there was a messy architectural office behind you."
The food and drink: The caterer Jamie Cheung of Edible Affairs organized a spread based on Hong Kong-style street food, with smaller bites and nongreasy finger fare (the better to eat while drawing tiles), including har gow shrimp dumplings, curry fish balls and tea eggs. The centerpiece was a croquembouche made not of profiteroles but of shoutao (longevity peach buns filled with lotus paste, typically eaten during birthday celebrations for elders). In keeping with the evening's lychee martinis -- the club's signature drink -- Cheung also served lychee-filled goji berry and chrysanthemum agar-agar jellies in the shape of mahjong tiles.
The music: Wong created a Spotify playlist inspired by the Hong Kong pop singer Sammi Cheng's 1995 song "Du Jiang Shi Chang" ("獨家試唱"), which became the club's anthem after Wong and Janssens were listening to a track list that the Chinatown community organizer Rochelle Kwan curated for the streaming radio station NTS. Wong's playlist's mostly mid-tempo tracks -- Cantopop hits from the 1990s and 2000s by Gigi Leung, Faye Wong and Ekin Cheung -- struck the mainly 30- and 40-something attendees with a wave of Chinese-inflected nostalgia. "A few told us they felt almost emotional," Janssens says.
The equipment: While some Chinese Americans are lucky enough to play with vintage resin mahjong sets inherited from their parents (which are actually similar to versions you can find on Amazon), Wong and Janssens had to get creative, given the number of tiles required. They borrowed sets from friends and family; Wong, asking his parents to lend him theirs, discovered an oversize set his grandparents owned decades earlier in Hong Kong (but they didn't send it from San Diego). The co-hosts also bought new sets from Walmart and Yellow Mountain Imports: glittery champagne versions and emerald ones that resemble pandan jellies. Slightly controversial to the purists were the American sets, which have numerals printed on tiles featuring Chinese characters, so non-Chinese speakers don't have to guess, for instance, whether a character means five or six.
The architectural touch: Wong says that although some mahjong players forgo them, pushers -- the ruler-like sticks used not just to organize the tiles into straight lines but also to count them -- are essential. Depending on the style of mahjong, the pushers are the length of 13 or 16 tiles lined up side by side; because preferences differ, the implements often need to be purchased separately. Instead, some employees at Food New York crafted their own out of balsa wood, the lightweight material used for design maquettes. "We make a lot of models in the office," Wong says, "so that was easy."

WASHINGTON — Around the time that the FBI was examining the equipment recovered from the Chinese spy balloon shot down off the South Carolina coast in February, U.S. intelligence agencies and Microsoft detected what they feared was a more worrisome intruder: mysterious computer code appearing in telecommunications systems in Guam and elsewhere in the United States.
The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, raised alarms because Guam, with its Pacific ports and vast U.S. air base, would be a centerpiece of any U.S. military response to an invasion or blockade of Taiwan. The operation was conducted with great stealth, sometimes flowing through home routers and other common internet-connected consumer devices, to make the intrusion harder to track.
The code is called a “web shell” — in this case, a malicious script that enables remote access to a server. Home routers are particularly vulnerable, especially older models that have not had updated software and protections.
Unlike the balloon that fascinated Americans as it performed pirouettes over sensitive nuclear sites, the computer code could not be shot down on live television. So instead, Microsoft on Wednesday published details of the code that would make it possible for corporate users, manufacturers and others to detect and remove it. In a coordinated release, the National Security Agency — along with other domestic agencies and counterparts in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Canada — published a 24-page advisory that referred to Microsoft’s finding and offered broader warnings about a “recently discovered cluster of activity” from China.
Microsoft called the hacking group “Volt Typhoon” and said that it was part of a state-sponsored Chinese effort aimed at not only critical infrastructure such as communications, electric and gas utilities but also maritime operations and transportation. The intrusions appeared, for now, to be an espionage campaign. But the Chinese could use the code, which is designed to pierce firewalls, to enable destructive attacks, if they choose.
So far, Microsoft said, there is no evidence that the Chinese group has used the access for any offensive attacks. Unlike Russian groups, the Chinese intelligence and military hackers usually prioritize espionage.
In interviews, administration officials said they believed the code was part of a vast Chinese intelligence collection effort that spans cyberspace, outer space and, as Americans discovered with the balloon incident, the lower atmosphere.
The Biden administration has declined to discuss what the FBI found as it examined the equipment recovered from the balloon. But the craft — better described as a huge aerial vehicle — apparently included specialized radars and communications interception devices that the FBI has been examining since the balloon was shot down.
It is unclear whether the government’s silence about its finding from the balloon is motivated by a desire to keep the Chinese government from knowing what the United States has learned or to get past the diplomatic breach that followed the incursion.
On Sunday, speaking at a news conference in Hiroshima, Japan, President Joe Biden referred to how the balloon incident had paralyzed the already frosty exchanges between Washington and Beijing.
“And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars’ worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States,” he told reporters, “and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another.”
He predicted that relations would “begin to thaw very shortly.”
China has never acknowledged hacking into U.S. networks, even in the biggest example of all: the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans — including 6 million sets of fingerprints — from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration of data took the better part of a year and resulted in an agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity.
On Wednesday, China sent a warning to its companies to be alert to U.S. hacking. And there has been plenty of that, too: In documents released by Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, there was evidence of U.S. efforts to hack into the systems of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and military and leadership targets.
Telecommunications networks are key targets for hackers, and the system in Guam is particularly important to China because military communications often piggyback on commercial networks.
Tom Burt, the executive who oversees Microsoft’s threat intelligence unit, said in an interview that the company’s analysts — many of them veterans of the NSA and other intelligence agencies — had found the code “while investigating intrusion activity impacting a U.S. port.” As they traced back the intrusion, they found other networks that were hit, “including some in the telecommunications sector in Guam.”
Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said that covert efforts “like the activity exposed today are part of what’s driving our focus on the security of telecom networks and the urgency to use trusted vendors” whose equipment has met established cybersecurity standards.
Neuberger has been spearheading an effort across the federal government to enforce new cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure. Officials were taken by surprise by the extent of the vulnerabilities in such infrastructure when a Russian ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021 interrupted gasoline, diesel and airplane fuel flow on the East Coast. In the wake of the attack, the Biden administration used little-known powers of the Transportation Security Administration — which regulates pipelines — to force private-sector utilities to follow a series of cybersecurity mandates.
Now Neuberger is driving what she called a “relentless focus on improving the cybersecurity of our pipelines, rail systems, water systems and other critical services,” including the mandates on cybersecurity practices for these sectors and closer collaboration with companies with “unique visibility” into threats to such infrastructure.
Those firms include Microsoft, Google, Amazon and many telecommunications firms that can see activity on domestic networks. Intelligence agencies, including the NSA, are forbidden by law from operating inside the United States. But the NSA is permitted to publish warnings, as it did Wednesday, alongside the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Infrastructure and Security Administration.
The agency’s report is part of a relatively new U.S. government move to publish such data quickly in hopes of burning operations like the one mounted by the Chinese government. In years past, the United States usually withheld such information — sometimes classifying it — and shared it with only a select few companies or organizations. But that almost always assured that the hackers could stay well ahead of the government.
In this case, it was the focus on Guam that particularly seized the attention of officials who are assessing China’s capabilities — and its willingness — to attack or choke off Taiwan. Xi has ordered the People’s Liberation Army to be capable of taking the island by 2027. But the CIA director, William Burns, has noted to Congress that the order “does not mean he has decided to conduct an invasion.”
In the dozens of U.S. tabletop exercises conducted in recent years to map out what such an attack might look like, one of China’s first anticipated moves would be to cut off U.S. communications and slow the U.S.’ ability to respond. So the exercises envision attacks on satellite and ground communications, especially around U.S. installations where military assets would be mobilized.
None is bigger than Guam, where Andersen Air Force Base would be the launching point for many of the Air Force missions to help defend the island, and a Navy port is crucial for U.S. submarines.

As Protesters Die, a Nation’s Security Forces Face Little Scrutiny

CHOQUECCA, Peru — In the adobe house she built with her husband in a small village in Peru, Antonia Huillca pulled out a stack of documents that once represented a glimmer of hope.
They were part of an investigation into the death of her husband, Quintino Cereceda, who left one morning in 2016 to join a protest against a new copper mine and never returned.
Huillca can’t read, but she can identify key documents: a photo of her husband’s body, a bullet wound to his forehead; the question-and-answer format in which police officers describe firing live ammunition as protesters threw rocks; the logo of the mining company sending convoys of trucks over unpaved roads, sparking protests among villagers fed up with the dust.
But today, the investigation has gone cold.
“All these years and no justice,” Huillca, a 51-year-old Quechua farmer, said as a storm gathered over her village, Choquecca, in Peru’s southern Andes. “It’s as if we don’t exist.”
For years, scores of similar cases in Peru have met a familiar fate: Investigations into the killing of unarmed civilians at protests where security forces were deployed, most of them in poor Indigenous and rural areas, are opened when they attract headlines, only to be closed quietly years later, with officials often citing a lack of evidence.
Now, the unusually high death toll during anti-government demonstrations after the removal of the country’s president last year has put accusations of abuse by security officials in the global spotlight, raising questions about why so many previous killings remain unsolved.
At least 49 civilians were killed in clashes with the police or military during protests after President Pedro Castillo was impeached in December when he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, according to figures from the country’s ombudsman’s office.
A New York Times investigation in March found that in three towns where deadly clashes occurred, the police and soldiers had fired shotguns at civilians using lethal ammunition, shot assault rifles at fleeing protesters and killed unarmed people, often in apparent violation of their own protocols.
“We went through the same thing,” said José Cárdenas, whose younger brother, Alberto, was killed in 2015 in clashes with police during protests that also targeted a copper mine. “My brother didn’t die in an accident. He was shot.”
So far, an investigation has not led to any charges.
A lack of accountability for excessive use of force by security agencies is a serious human rights failure, according to civil rights organizations, undermining people’s faith in the authorities.
In Peru, more than 200 civilians have been killed in police and military crackdowns on protests in the past two decades, according to a list compiled by the National Human Rights Coordinator, an advocacy group.
Yet, over that same period, prosecutors have not won a single conviction against police or military officers or their superiors for killings at protests, according to human rights activists, lawyers and two state prosecutors who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.
In most cases, investigations do not even lead to a trial, they said, adding that, instead, demonstrators and protest leaders are accused of vandalism or inciting public disorder.
“It’s backwards — when it’s about punishing campesinos they move fast,” said David Velazco, a human rights lawyer who has defended more than 200 rural protesters on various charges, including vandalism and disturbing the public order.
The prime minister’s office and the national prosecutor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment, while the Interior Ministry declined to answer questions.
The country’s current president, Dina Boluarte, who took over after Castillo was ousted, has blamed the deadly clashes on protesters who have blocked roads and attacked security forces with rocks and slingshots.
Investigations involving clashes in rural areas can be challenging, legal analysts say, partly because it can be hard to determine whether police face a legitimate threat to their lives when they are outnumbered by protesters, said Rolando Luque, who monitors conflicts in the ombudsman’s office.
“At some point, while carrying out their duties, they could be” overtaken by protesters, he said, and “they could be killed with their own weapons.”
That is what happened during a clash in the Amazon between protesters and police in 2009 that left 23 officers and 10 civilians dead, said Luque, who witnessed the aftermath. The officers, he said, “were taken into the forest and executed.”
Further complicating matters, the police and the military often refuse to share details about their operations, according to lawyers involved in cases of civilian deaths. And cases tend to be assigned to overworked prosecutors, some of whom manage more than 200 at a time.
Prosecutors have been reluctant to investigate top government officials who may have authorized or encouraged the use of lethal force, or the role of mining companies that hire police to provide private security, human rights activists said.
“There’s a clear lack of institutional will to tackle the issue,” said Carlos Rivera, a human rights lawyer.
Peru is not the only South American democracy where unarmed civilians have been killed in protests as popular discontent has boiled over into the street.
Javier Puente, a scholar of Andean studies at Smith College in Massachusetts, said militaries and police have long helped weak Latin American leaders make up for the lack of strong parties and other institutions, normalizing violent solutions to political problems.
“The price that Peru pays for the form of institutionalism that the military and the police offers is impunity,” Puente said.
Peru’s return to democracy in 2000 after years of authoritarian rule raised expectations of broader access to justice and political representation, along with an end to the police and military abuses of Peruvians, notably against Indigenous people.
Instead, as Peru experienced a rapid economic expansion, those hopes were left by the wayside.
One democratically elected president after another became mired in corruption scandals. Inequality remained high, social conflicts festered and a global commodities boom brought huge mining projects to rural Indigenous regions.
“They never listen to us. They just send in the police,” said Melchor Yauri, a member of an Indigenous community in southern Peru.
He said his father, Félix, was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet by police during a protest in 2012 over pollution from a copper mine and died from an infection to his wounds. An investigation into his death was closed in 2015.
Peru’s police could be given greater immunity under a proposed congressional bill that would shift trials involving officers from civilian courts to a military-police court.
While neighboring countries, including Chile and Colombia, have elected leaders who promised changes to address excessive force, abuse and impunity in Peru seem to be growing more entrenched, said Will Freeman, a fellow in Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. research institute.
Boluarte and most lawmakers “don’t even seem interested in pretending to put pressure behind accountability or reforms,” Freeman said.
Days after nine civilians were killed in clashes with security forces in December, Boluarte promoted her defense minister to prime minister. Her administration has described the police’s handling of protests as “impeccable” and proposed longer prison sentences for people who damage property or disrupt public order.
The relatives of victims of recent clashes say they do not trust the head of the prosecutor’s office, Patricia Benavides, after she removed prosecutors who specialize in human rights violations from investigations and moved cases from rural areas to Lima, the capital, making it harder for family members to monitor their progress.
After her husband’s death at the mining protest, Huillca said her herd of sheep dwindled to 30 from 500, as she has sold them off to support her children’s education.
To this day, she freezes up when she sees the police. “I’m afraid they’ll do the same thing to me,” she said.

A.I.'s Help Enlisted For Video Games: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Generative A.I. is already changing how games are made, with Blizzard Entertainment training an image generator on assets from World of Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.
Intrigued by the potential that generative artificial intelligence holds for video game design, the studio Blizzard Entertainment has trained an image generator on its own hit titles. By feeding assets like the combative orcs of World of Warcraft, the macabre dungeons of Diablo and the vivacious heroes of Overwatch into the machine, Blizzard can effortlessly produce concept art for new ideas.
Because generative artificial intelligence creates art faster than any human can, studios like Blizzard, a division of Activision Blizzard, are hopeful that the technology can cut out some design and development drudgery and make the creation of video games more fun.
Blizzard's chief design officer, Allen Adham, told employees about the initiative last month in an email that was obtained by The New York Times. Its internal tool is called Blizzard Diffusion, a riff on Stable Diffusion, one of the popular image generators that enables anyone to turn text into art.
"Prepare to be amazed," Adham wrote, adding, "We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games."
Generative artificial intelligence, the technology behind tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, uses considerable computing power to identify patterns in text or images and produce new content from the data.
Some researchers are wary of the technology, warning of copyright abuses, job displacement, and its potential to help the spread of false information. But video game developers, already relying on artificial intelligence so that nonplayer characters can make humanlike decisions, believe that harnessing generative A.I. can speed up the creative process in a labor-intensive industry plagued by delays.
There is a gaming A.I. division at Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, and Ubisoft has built a tool called Ghostwriter that could produce basic dialogue for games like Assassin's Creed. Several start-ups say their technology can make it easier to design the look of the nonplayer characters, known as NPCs, that give video game worlds heft.
Chris Lee, the former studio head of Halo Infinite at 343 Industries, said generative A.I. could improve game development by reducing the human toil required to make an enormous open-world game.
"Game developers have never been able to keep up with the demands of our audiences," said Lee, who is now the head of immersive technologies at Amazon Web Services.
Halo Infinite was supposed to be the flagship launch game for the Xbox Series X in 2020, but its graphics were derided by fans as flat and ugly after an eight-minute preview was released. The studio ultimately delayed the game for another year.
The game's developers were miserable, Lee said, because even working on place-holder encounters required slowly moving pixels frame by frame. "To load this giant world, it's painful, it's like specialized data entry," he said.
Generative A.I. could also streamline quality assurance testing. At a recent conference for game developers, Kate Rayner, technical director for the Coalition, the studio behind Gears of War, talked about how A.I. could be used to catch bugs and glitches so players would see fewer crashes on launch day.
Many of the promises of generative A.I. are speculative, with Blizzard already abandoning machine-learning technology it had patented to create environmental textures like stone and brick.
Andrew Guerrero, Blizzard's vice president of global insights, said the tool was taking up too much artist time to be effective. But he said another A.I. tool was helping fit cosmetic headpieces to player models in World of Warcraft.
"The goal is to remove a repetitive and manual process and enable artists to spend more time on creativity," Guerrero said in a statement. "Our goal with A.I. has been, and will continue to be, to try to make creative work easier."
The internal email about Blizzard Diffusion said it was being used to help generate concept art for game environments as well as characters and their outfits. It also mentioned possible tools for "autonomous, intelligent, in-game NPCs," "procedurally assisted level design" and A.I.-assisted "voice cloning," "game coding" and "anti-toxicity."
Ghostwriter, Ubisoft's A.I. dialogue tool, was a request by writers who faced the daunting and sometimes tedious task of filling open-world games with more than 100,000 lines of dialogue, the company said.
Many of those lines are the background chatter of characters that help simulate a living world; one mundane interaction may require a dozen or more variations.
In a promotional video for Ghostwriter, an employee begins with the prompt "I used to be an adventurer like you" (a nod to an infamous line in Skyrim) and hones several suggestions by the A.I., including "I was once the most talented and famous adventurer in the land" and "I remember when I was young and strong."
These simple lines of dialogue have been a way for people to start careers in video game writing, and developers argued on social media that automating these tasks could threaten such jobs. Simon Johnson, an economist at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management who has a new book about the impact of automation, said it was a bad idea for tech companies to invent algorithms that mimic humans.
"We should be focused on machines that help humans improve human capabilities, rather than displacing people," he said.
Yves Jacquier, the executive director of Ubisoft La Forge, the research and development team responsible for Ghostwriter, said there had been a similar but unfounded fear that video game animators would be replaced when motion capture was introduced decades ago.
"While the future may involve more technology, it doesn't take away the human in the loop," Jacquier said in a statement. "Artists, writers and coders will always be at the heart of the development process, and while A.I. can now do a better job at assisting creators in their workflow, it's the artistic vision and perspective of individuals that are essential in the creation of games."
Another inescapable concern about A.I.-produced content is copyright. In one high-profile lawsuit, Getty Images has accused Stable Diffusion of scraping 12 million images from its photo database.
Employees of Activision Blizzard received an email this month from Michael Vance, its chief technology officer, that warned them not to use the company's intellectual property with external image generators. (Microsoft is looking to purchase Activision for nearly $ 70 billion, but regulators want to block the deal.)
"These new tools come with new and unknown risks, and we will proceed carefully to avoid pitfalls," Vance wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Times.
Some Activision Blizzard employees said the company's A.I. tools have not always delivered as promised, pointing to those that struggled to catch bugs or interact properly with game environments.
"Leadership's focus on A.I. doesn't feel like it is solving a problem that individual contributors care about," said Valentine Powell, a former World of Warcraft engineer who left Blizzard last August. "It feels like ignoring their problems and focusing on hype words that they think will sound impressive to shareholders."
Smaller video game studios that do not have the resources to create generative A.I. tools are turning to start-ups for help.
Scenario, which raised $ 6 million in seed funding in January, creates image databases to turn text prompts into assets -- such as a lizard in a spacesuit -- that can then be incorporated into games.
Its image generator is being used by a few small games. In tests by The Times, it sometimes spit out animated characters with unrealistic-looking hands, a common weakness for image generators.
Another start-up, Didimo, said that Soleil Game Studios, which makes fighting games based on properties like Naruto and Samurai Jack, had created hundreds of nonplayer characters using its A.I.-powered generator.
"We just automated that process, allowing them to remove the mundane jobs, because it just gets boring after a while," Sean Cooper, a Didimo developer, said.
Video games can take years to create, and it is early enough in the hype cycle that few published games have used generative A.I. But some companies like Niantic, the developer behind Pokémon Go, have experimented with the tools to create marketing materials, for instance writing a news release in Dr. Seuss's tone of voice.
Niantic also used ChatGPT while working on Peridot, a new augmented reality game that leverages '90s nostalgia for digital pets.
Kellee Santiago, Niantic's head of production, said that it was expensive to fill a room with creative people, and that the technology condensed the time needed to generate ideas.
"I, for one, am happy to have the first six hours of a brainstorm taken care of for me," she said.

New Yorkers are lucky that the exuberantly domed 1880 Weir Greenhouse in Brooklyn, the last known commercial Victorian conservatory in the city, is still around to marvel at.
The little greenhouse, on the west side of Fifth Avenue at 25th Street, looks like a retro spaceship of copper and glass that has just touched down from Victorian Gotham. If you like time travel, this is the place for you. The structure stands across the avenue from the double-arched entry gate of Green-Wood Cemetery, a transporting 1865 Gothic Revival confection of elaborately carved brownstone.
But good bones and landmark status do not guarantee longevity, and that was especially true with the conservatory.
By 2011, vandals and a century-plus of weather had rendered the fragile greenhouse a virtual ruin. Many of its badly rotting ground-floor window frames had been kicked in by marauding thieves. The brick wall at its base was crumbling. Leaking and missing window panes abounded, with repair estimates topping $ 1 million.
Although the hothouse was a city landmark, it was at risk of presiding over its own funeral. But in 2012, Green-Wood Cemetery swooped in to rescue it, buying the decaying treasure for $ 1.63 million from McGovern Florists, a flower-selling family with deep Brooklyn roots that had owned the place for 41 years.
By this July, workers are expected to put the finishing touches on an arduous, eight-and-a-half year reconstruction of the greenhouse, which is to be the gleaming jewel at the center of a planned education and welcome center for the cemetery. A Green-Wood spokesman estimated that the cost of the greenhouse work was "in the low eight figures."
On May 23, ground will be broken for the boxy, L-shaped modern building of glass and burgundy glazed terra cotta that will wrap around and connect to the greenhouse. Designed by Architecture Research Office, the low-slung, $ 35 million structure is intended to be a neighborhood hub for Sunset Park, comprising exhibition galleries, a classroom for programs and community use, and a climate-controlled research center for the graveyard's archives, which date to 1838.
"It's inherent to the cemetery business that at some point you will run out of room to bury people, and you really have to think about what will this green space become and how can you make it an asset to the community," said Lisa Alpert, Green-Wood's vice president of development and programming.
More than 5,000 schoolchildren from all over the city visit the cemetery each year, exploring cemetery records and the stories of notable people interred there to learn about American history, art, architecture and the environment. But those programs take place outdoors and are severely curtailed during cold months. After the new building opens in late 2024, however, Green-Wood will greatly expand its year-round educational and cultural offerings.
Plans for the greenhouse itself are evolving, but it will likely be used as a flexible events space for meetings, receptions or small repasts after a funeral.
The Weir Greenhouse was commissioned by James Weir, Jr., whose Scottish immigrant father founded a florist business in Bay Ridge in 1850, soon propagating a love of flowers in his boys. His eldest son and namesake put out his own shingle in 1861, ultimately constructing a small rectangular wood-and-glass greenhouse on the southwest corner of 25th Street and Fifth Avenue in 1880. Situated directly across from Green-Wood's main entrance, this was the premier location in the floral district that had blossomed in the area to serve the cemetery.
Weir's business flourished. The 1884 "History of Kings County" observed that the "thousands of people" who annually "pass Mr. Weir's charming conservatory, redolent with the perfumes of the rarest exotics and native flowers, find this one of the chief attractions of the Cemetery."
Weir had the Fort Hamilton Avenue entrance to Green-Wood covered, too. There he put up a greenhouse that had been exhibited at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, according to an 1894 edition of The Florist's Exchange. That showplace included rock-work "in the shape of an entrance to a cave in some wooded dell."
Like a plant outgrowing its pot, Weir's business apparently demanded more space. So in 1895 he applied to the City of Brooklyn for a permit to alter his 25th Street greenhouse, according to the architectural historian Andrew S. Dolkart, who wrote the 1982 designation report on the structure for the city landmarks commission. But the alteration was so extensive that its replacement, the greenhouse that survived into the 21st century, bore little resemblance to its forebear.
Designed by the architect George Curtis Gillespie, who lived nearby, the new structure was "a miniature crystal palace," according to the American Institute of Architects.
The central feature was its octagonal, copper-clad dome, some 25 feet across. A smaller dome capped the corner entrance. These domes, along with the building's abundant wood-framed windows and the glazed roofs that sloped downward from the clerestory at the base of the main dome, rested on a cast-iron framework resembling, from the inside, the ribbed skeleton of a whimsical mythical beast.
Weir died of a heart attack in 1906 while yacht racing in Peconic Bay, on the east end of Long Island, and in 1912, his son, James E. Weir, incorporated as J.E. Weir & Co. with Arthur W. Hawkins and Augustus M. Dauernheim, who managed the Brooklyn operations.
Dauernheim later branched out on his own, establishing a 60-acre nursery in the Long Island town of Wantagh. But ultimately his company acquired the Weir Greenhouse, which it used for selling rather than growing.
McGovern Florists, led by Catherine McGovern, a whirlwind of energy whom everyone knew as Kay, bought the greenhouse in 1971. The McGoverns were an old Brooklyn florist family. After entering the business in the 1870s, they established a sprawling complex of greenhouses between 18th and 19th streets, near the Prospect Park West entrance of Green-Wood.
But the McGovern greenhouses were clear-cut in the 1950s to make way for the Prospect Expressway, an indignity that Ms. McGovern never forgot.
When the Weir Greenhouse came up for sale, she "bought it because it reminded her of her family place that had been taken down near the highway," said Kevin McGovern, her nephew, who succeeded her in the business in 1990. And though many property owners bridle at the hassle and expense of landmark regulations, Ms. McGovern pushed to gain landmark protection for the hothouse, Mr. McGovern said, "because she didn't want it to meet the same fate that McGovern's did."
Mr. Dolkart, the architectural historian, also strongly advocated for landmark designation, arguing that the antique greenhouse was a precious survivor.
"There used to be many around cemeteries, and monument carvers as well, and they've largely disappeared," he said. "But for its own unique reasons that this one greenhouse survives is absolutely extraordinary to me, because it's such a fragile type of building."
In the McGovern era, the greenhouse was dominated by a massive rubber plant, more than 15 feet high and 20 feet wide at its top. Inside the main dome, suspended in the air, was an artificial Christmas tree festooned with ornaments. During the Christmas season, the tree was lowered.
But perhaps the greatest attraction was the voluble pair of green Amazon parrots, Molly and Laura, who routinely hollered "Hello" at customers.
Before the parrots took up residence there, they had lived with Catholic nuns.
"When we got them they used to whisper like they were praying," said Mr. McGovern, 58. "And one of them could sing the 'Ave Maria."'
During the 1980s and early 1990s, burglars repeatedly broke in to steal computers and other valuables. Even the beloved parrots were purloined.
"For the regular customers, it was like a loss of someone in their family," Mr. McGovern said wistfully.
When the restoration team from Page Ayres Cowley Architecture got into the conservatory in 2013, they were astonished by the simple technology used to assemble it.
"The whole building was put together with copper wire," Gustavo Carrera, the project manager, said during a recent visit, pointing at little holes in a cast-iron rib through which wire was originally threaded. "Every single wooden member was attached to the cast-iron frame with copper wire."
In the end, not much of the original building besides that cast-iron frame could be saved, due both to deterioration and stricter building codes. Stainless steel bolts were used to connect new wooden members to the iron armature.
Using period photographs, fire insurance maps, old buildings department applications and information gathered from an on-site survey, the team recreated the original greenhouse. When the new sloping glazed roofs leaked, Walter B. Melvin Architects was retained. They solved the problem with a simplified design, employing a time-tested system of copper mullions and 14-foot-long pieces of glass.
Atop the main dome, the rebuilt conservatory was crowned with a replica of the original sign, copper letters against a wire-mesh screen bearing the name Weir. (The name McGovern was added in the 1970s, but left off the reconstructed building.)
To Thomas E. Rinaldi, a design historian, that old Weir sign was as rare as the rarest orchid.
He said he believed that the original sign was the last wire-mesh-style sign in the city dating to the turn of the 20th century, when such signage was ubiquitous. One example appears in a 1913 Edward Hopper painting, "New York Corner," a depiction of a saloon that hung in a recent exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
"They're totally forgotten," Mr. Rinaldi said. "Nobody who's alive today has any memory of these wire-mesh signs being a character-defining element of the New York City streetscape." For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Bathrooms Are Where People Are Most Vulnerable: [Op-Ed]

Full text: A few years ago, I attended an advertising conference in the South of France. I was staying at a glitzy hotel on a glittering boulevard along the Côte d'Azur. I was in business attire, a navy pantsuit. On my way to a meeting, I ducked into the women's bathroom off the lobby. Then I heard heavy footsteps and a breathless voice saying, in French, "There's a man in the bathroom!"
"Monsieur, monsieur," another voice boomed. The door of my stall rattled as a fist pounded it from outside.
"I am a woman," I replied in French, using the most feminine intonation I could muster, frantically gathering the trousers pooled around my ankles to get out of the stall as quickly as possible.
The woman who had been pounding on the door, a security guard, seemed skeptical and waited until I left the stall just to make sure. Flustered as I was, I stepped out and flashed the friendliest smile I could manage, jutting out my hairless chin as proof that I belonged in this space despite the mannish cut of my suit and my close-cropped hairstyle. As a cisgender lesbian who is occasionally mistaken for a man, I have sometimes found bathrooms to be fraught spaces. But never to this extent. This was terrifying and humiliating.
I was reminded of this moment on Wednesday when the Florida governor and almost certain Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis signed several new bills directly targeting the freedom and dignity of queer people. Surrounded by smiling children, DeSantis scrawled his signature on a bunch of draconian new laws, including a far-reaching one that will require people in government-run buildings -- including state universities, prisons and public schools -- to use bathrooms associated with their sex assigned at birth. Anyone who fails to comply could face misdemeanor trespassing charges that could result in jail time.
When a law like this was passed in North Carolina in 2016, it prompted a furious outcry. Major companies announced they would halt plans to expand in the state. The N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. moved major events elsewhere. North Carolina faced billions in potential losses and ultimately repealed the measure.
Now, bathroom bills are back, part of a pitiless onslaught against trans bodies that gathers speed with each passing day. The new Florida bills target many aspects of trans people's lives, expanding the "Don't Say Gay" policies in school to older students, banning gender-affirming medical care for children and allowing the state to seize children from parents who allow them to receive such care. The laws also prohibit schools from recognizing a child's preferred name or pronouns.
The new bathroom law is particularly cruel and absurd. Politicians claim these measures seek to make bathrooms safer. But I have yet to see any of these legislators produce a shred of credible evidence that transgender people pose a safety threat to cisgender people in bathrooms.
What is clear is that they open up transgender people to harassment, intimidation and surveillance. Around 10 states have passed laws barring transgender children from using their chosen bathroom. So far this year there are more than 30 bills aimed at restricting bathroom use by trans people, according to the Human Rights Campaign, more than any other year on record. But none have gone as far as Florida, which is now the only state to criminalize using a bathroom that doesn't align with your sex at birth.
Bathrooms have long been porcelain crucibles for our deepest fears and anxieties. One hardly needs to crack open the collected works of Sigmund Freud to understand why they have been the sites of repression and humiliation in service of enforcing hierarchies.
Perhaps that is because few human experiences are truly universal, and the deep unease of needing a bathroom and not being able to find or use one is one of them. And there are few places where human beings feel more vulnerable: Bathrooms are a place where we expose our most tender parts and attend to the most private needs. So, it is no surprise that policing access to facilities to meet basic bodily needs has been an effective method of repression for a very long time.
"A lot of the things about gender and sexuality and identity that people get anxious about or don't want to talk about, they'll project onto the space of the bathroom," said Sheila Cavanagh, a professor of sociology and a psychotherapist who has written extensively about the politicization of bathrooms.
During the civil rights movement, advocates for segregation made lurid (and absurd) claims that white girls could contract venereal diseases from toilet seats shared with Black girls. Bathrooms are a place where we enforce hierarchies of class, from the executive washrooms of old to the shameful barring of delivery workers from using restaurant bathrooms (a practice now banned in New York City). Drivers who deliver Amazon packages have reported having to urinate in bottles because of the intense time pressure the company put on them.
In the movie "The Help," which is about Black housekeepers and their white employers in Mississippi in the 1960s, a pivotal dispute is over the housekeeper having access to a bathroom used by the white family that employs her. She protests this affront to her dignity by serving her employer a chocolate pie with a scatological secret ingredient.
Women have been denied access to bathrooms as well. It wasn't until 1992 that the Senate decided to build a dedicated bathroom for women elected to the chamber. This ended decades of forcing female senators to run downstairs and queue up with hoi polloi at the public restroom.
In an article about the ultraconservative Regier family that is increasingly dominating Montana politics, I came across a startling anecdote about an early priority of Matt Regier, speaker of the State House. At one meeting he raised the question of how to manage the chamber's bathrooms with the arrival of a transgender legislator, Zooey Zephyr. Even to one fellow Republican, this seemed a strange area of focus, but it was decided, The Times reported, that a lock would be installed on the main door to the multistall women's bathroom to avoid the possibility of anyone having to share it with Zephyr.
Whatever its stated purpose, the Florida bill seems intended to terrify and humiliate transgender people.
The writer and activist Erin Reed wrote that the bill "effectively deputizes cisgender individuals as bathroom enforcers, tasking them with identifying and reporting suspected transgender people for arrest and subsequent gender investigation."
Imagine, Reed asks, if she was transiting through a Florida airport, a government facility that could be covered by the bill, and needed to pee. "As a post-op transgender woman who is consistently recognized as my correct gender, I can never safely use a male restroom," she wrote.
You don't have to look very hard on any social media platform to find horrifying examples of transgender and gender-nonconforming people being harassed in bathrooms. These videos are terrifying in their ubiquity and chilling in their cruelty. These new laws will make what happened to me look like child's play.
Since adolescence, I have been somewhere on the more masculine end of the tomboy spectrum. This has created plenty of awkwardness in my life. But what happened in France was something else. It was a sharp rebuke that sent an unforgettable message: Your appearance makes you suspect. The authorities have the right to inspect your body and evaluate your fitness to occupy this space.
It didn't matter that I was a guest at a five-star hotel, the editor of one of the biggest news websites in the world, an executive at a giant American corporation. Some random woman in a bathroom didn't think I belonged there, and I was subjected to humiliating scrutiny as a result.
When I think back now on that bathroom in France, I feel a little embarrassed at how I responded. My goal was to escape the situation as quickly as possible -- a reasonable response to a horrible experience. And yet my method of escape -- proving that I belonged and was blameless rather than rejecting scrutiny -- felt deeply familiar.
It was the same impulse that I had silently learned, without ever being explicitly taught, as a young Black person in America, that when I was in a store I should keep my hands out of my pockets and avoid anything that looked like a furtive movement lest I be accused of theft. As most Black kids do, I had to learn to live with the knowledge that I was subject to enhanced surveillance because of the color of my skin. I have long since shed such reflexive fears with regard to my race. But old habits die hard, and in that bathroom they came roaring back with regard to gender.
There is a wonderful euphemism in Nigeria for needing to use the toilet: "I am going to ease myself," the felicitous phrase goes. What I love about that expression is that it artfully captures what one is seeking in the bathroom: relief, safety and above all, ease.
The rash of bills targets transgender people for scrutiny, surveillance and judgment, and that is reason enough to reject them as an affront to human dignity. But my experience tells me that these laws are really about something else: a step along the path to a rigid enforcement of gender norms, roles and presentation. It is about the routine humiliation and degradation of people who look or behave in ways a fanatical minority wants to punish. They will not stop until anyone who fails to meet their rigid definitions of identity forfeits the right to feel at ease.

Our Endless, Absurd Quest To Get the Very Best: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Let me tell you about my friend Dan Symons. There is a kind of person who finds the idea of seeking out "the best" incredibly enticing, on an almost spiritual level. The kind of person who genuinely enjoys perusing articles like "the nine best hair dryers of 2023," who is overcome with clammy dread at the idea of drinking in a bar with only a four-star rating on Google, who, in order to plan a weekend getaway, requires a prolonged and extensive operation that involves several spreadsheets. You know the type. Maybe you even are the type.
Dan is that kind of person. He is also from California (perhaps not a coincidence that this is the home of both the eternal quest for self-optimization and the internet ecosystem that underpins the explosion in ratings culture), works in tech and has a keen appreciation for the finer things in life. He is known throughout our friend group for his fastidiously curated lists of restaurants, bars and even specific menu items; his near refusal to venture into establishments that are anything less than excellent; and his hours spent trawling reviews for everything from mini-fridges to trail shoes. When I questioned him on a rumor that I heard recently, that he had been freezing packets of "the best butter" to bring back from France, he confirmed it was true.
Dan may be an extreme case, but a dampened version of his instinct permeates our culture. If it didn't, the raft of articles solemnly decreeing this year's superlative vacuum cleaners simply would not exist. I had been wondering about where this culture of ratings and rankings came from and how it came to take over our lives; how even the least exciting consumer choices are framed in terms of elusive state-of-the-art options; and, conversely, how necessarily subjective things (novels, colleges, where to live) are increasingly presented as consumer choices for which there is an objective "best."
I thought Dan could shed some light on what the pursuit of "the best" really means. But when I asked him, what I learned was that the motivation behind his "quest for the best" wasn't what I expected. It wasn't about snobbery, or even, really, self-optimization.
"I think the really important thing to me -- which is probably not a healthy thing -- is I want to make sure the people I'm with have the best time possible," Dan told me. "And this comes down to not just going to the restaurant, but even ordering as well. Like, 'Are you sure you want to get that dish? Based on the other things we're getting, is that the right thing to get?' It extends through the whole meal." To me it actually sounds, instead, as if Dan is trying to guarantee something closer to happiness. But can happiness really be found in a packet of butter?
Rankings, of course, are nothing new. Sight and Sound has put out a list of greatest films every 10 years since 1952. The U.S. News & World Report college rankings were first published in 1983. (It will probably surprise nobody that this year's top three are Princeton, M.I.T. and Harvard.) Rolling Stone released its first list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" in 2003. Some version of the "hottest new restaurants of the year" could be found in local newspapers and magazines for decades -- not to mention the best dentists, doctors, schools. These have always provoked conversation, backlash, letters to the editor.
But over the past 20 years, the internet gave us more and more ways to make ratings of our own, rather than just objecting to or agreeing with those handed down by editors. Online reviews first appeared around 1999, on sites like eBay. Yelp was created in 2004 to help people find good local businesses. Google reviews followed in 2007. These are now among the first places where people look when trying to find practically any business or service. And participating in these rankings can feel like one of the demands of the responsible consumer: If you go to an emerging small business, it's now normal for someone to ask you to help it out by filling out a Google review. (I myself have left giddy tributes to my beloved hairdresser across the internet.)
Listicles proliferated as a kind of content that was easy to produce, easy to attract attention to, easy to sell ads against. In the heyday of BuzzFeed, the listicle tended to take the form of "50 times baby pandas were the cutest," but with the advent of affiliate links, the likes of New York magazine's The Strategist and The New York Times's very own Wirecutter use them to rank all manner of consumer goods. The best easy-to-assemble tents, the 30 softest midrange nightgowns, the 17 smoothest razors under $ 50, the top seven waterproof briefcases.
There are best-of lists of less concrete things, too: the 100 best novelists of the past 100 years; rich lists; the 30 under 30. It's everywhere. And it can start to feel like the logical way to organize even highly personal information.
Some of us have even started listicle-ing ourselves. I recently spoke to my trusted adviser on all things Gen Z, my brother Ryan, to get an idea of how ratings culture has influenced those who have grown up completely immersed in it. It's worse than I suspected.
Ryan told me about a recent conversation at his workplace. Over lunch, he and his colleagues were sharing stories about the proliferation of spreadsheets and ratings systems. One of the women described a friend who kept a spreadsheet with her own personalized ratings for everything from TV shows to recipes. "But probably the most jarring one was one she had made for her sexual partners," Ryan said. "Most people around the table were kind of aghast." But then another woman said she does the same thing.
Even for those of us who don't relate to Dan Symons -- much less keep a spreadsheet of everyone we have slept with -- rankings and lists still have a use: They help us make sense of our impossibly vast consumer landscape.
There is a way of talking about the psychedelic, hysterical effect of the information glut produced by the internet that tends to exaggerate the nefariousness of certain elements -- like repeatedly being shown advertisements for things you've already bought -- while minimizing how chaotic and messy it all feels. You could, for example, say that these lists are a product of "ratings derangement syndrome" and then say something like "In a world where our tech overlords manipulate their distraction vortex to shovel us into the slobbering maw of capitalism, ratings offer the illusion of taking back a semblance of control."
Maybe. But to me, anyway, the experience of shopping for a hair dryer online feels less like being a pawn in a Matrix-esque mind-control operation and more like being trapped inside a box of plastic toys that have all been wound up so they constantly chatter and clatter against one another. The reality is I just want to spend as little time as possible in that box, while also hopefully buying something that won't break the second time I use it. Best-of lists and rankings can seem like a simple solution to this problem.
There are a lot of areas where people don't feel as if they have expertise, and ratings "get rid of that feeling of not being competent," Rick Larrick, a professor of management and organization at Duke University, told me.
Dr. Larrick has studied consumers' tendency to trust rankings and, in particular, to chase "the best." He has found that people put a strange amount of faith in this. "As soon as you put a rank on things," even something like toilet cleaner, "people's preference for the top-ranked one increases substantially, by around 20 percent," he said. "There is something about the comfort of using the simple differentiation between one and two. The ranks make it easy to make the decision, and then there's some feeling to being able to clearly tell yourself that you got the best one."
I'd venture that not many people (possibly not any people) are able to tell the difference between the top toilet cleaner and the second best -- or even the fifth or sixth. This suggests that the appeal of the best is not really about a simple difference in the quality of the product, but more about a feeling: of reassurance, maybe; of having won, having got the right thing.
Dan's proclivities would place him squarely as "a maximizer," a category of consumer invented by Barry Schwartz, an emeritus professor of psychology at Swarthmore College and the author of "The Paradox of Choice," which examines the detrimental side of endless consumer options. Dr. Schwartz defines people who are happy to settle for something that will probably be pretty good (a restaurant with above average, but not excellent, ratings; the third song they come to on a playlist; the midpriced toaster on the first page of Amazon) as "satisficers" and those who search exhaustively for the best version as "maximizers." (Many people who are generally satisficers will have certain things that bring out their inner maximizer. In other words, we all have an inner Dan Symons.)
When I started thinking about this idea of bests, it was through the prism of my own disposition, that of a settler, someone of the "just get one that works" school of thought. When I see a broken toaster, I see an annoying problem to be solved as quickly as possible. But Dan sees an opportunity: to get something that works a little faster, which would perhaps be more aesthetically pleasing, or run more smoothly, or not break so easily, and thus, to make life just that tiny bit better, with the only cost being a small investment in time spent doing research.
But these impulses have more in common than it seems. Both are attempts to solve the overwhelming consumer landscape facilitated by the internet. One (mine) is to try to engage with it as little as possible, essentially to run away and hide; the other is to greet the possibilities it offers with open arms, treating it as a challenge that can be won. One instinctively makes more sense to me, but then the other probably guarantees the better toaster. I wonder, though, if the better toaster promises something bigger. And in that case, can the better toaster ever really be enough? And what about when we're talking about something bigger, more significant, more subjective, more human than a toaster?
The people I know who broadly seem most content with their lives have adopted the satisficer's mind-set. When my hairdresser (a man of infinite wisdom) suggested I get a heat protection spray and I asked which one, he imparted some advice in this vein: "Oh, it doesn't really matter," he said. "Just don't spend £3, but don't spend £25 either." (The latter is the price of the brand the salon sells.) "Nobody really needs that. Spend around £7. That should be all right. Yes, always stick to the midrange. I should be a salesman!" He laughed. "Although not for the one we actually sell."
Dr. Schwartz goes further: He has found that those who are on the higher end of the maximizing scale not only have a harder time making decisions but also are less satisfied with the decisions they do make. They're also more likely to be borderline clinically depressed, he told me. "So it's really not doing anyone a favor," he said.
But the sensible attitude -- as obvious as it may sound -- can be hard to put into practice. Or maybe it's easier to put into practice with hair spray than it is with, say, a "perfect vacation" or the "optimal time to retire."
As I was thinking about all of this, I remembered a family vacation I went on when I was about 15, before seemingly everything was planned using smartphones and TripAdvisor. An elderly relative had saved up the money he was paid as a priest (I know, I grew up in Ireland) and gave it to my parents, who took us to Rome. My dad had meticulously plotted out our meals, but as we traipsed from restaurant to restaurant in the blazing heat, we repeatedly found that they were all closed: His guidebook was out of date; it was the height of summer and the city was dead. My dad would respond by having a meltdown in some piazza, then regain composure and select another guidebook recommendation. At the time, I found this maddening. I just wanted to eat something and then slink off to spend hours walking around and, perhaps, drink wine by a fountain near some Italian boys.
In hindsight, I have realized we were both after essentially the same thing: We both saw our trip as a rare opportunity, and we wanted to squeeze as much out of it as possible.
Out-of-date guidebooks are long gone, but many of us now take a "my dad in Rome" attitude to vacations -- fastidiously planning meals and excursions that can't possibly be missed, to insulate ourselves from the sense we might be wasting any of the experience. Spontaneity can feel risky when we all have constant, easy access to the internet, ostensibly a flawless, infinite guidebook. But we can forget that feeling -- happiness, smugness and satisfaction mixed with relief -- of finding something really great by accident.
It's true that searching long enough for something can make the fantasy version -- the version with which you'd be happy -- seem more and more perfect in the abstract, in such a way that it drifts farther and farther away. It's human nature to want more, and better. Indulging this instinct can push us toward better options, to a point, and from then on hopelessly feed a sense of want. I see this most vividly in online dating, where optimizing everyone's power to search for a partner seems to have caused more disappointment and loneliness than anything else.
It's a sentiment that has the folksy feel of a Sunday school teaching, but still, part of having a good life is learning to be happy with what you have. As Dr. Schwartz put it: "We mistakenly think it is a treasure hunt. And it's not a treasure hunt. It's more like treasure creation."
I find the sense of total directionlessness that is suggested by Googling something like "what is the best number of kids to have?" bizarre. But if people are earnestly using information like this to make their life choices, I would venture that this is because of a sense that those answers really do exist and the internet has made them easy to find. People have always felt lost, but the search for quantifiable, certified answers is now created by the existence of the answers themselves: a perfect number of wedding guests; the right place to live; the best age to be alive (it's 36). All suggest sureness in a world that feels confusing. It always has, but the answer to this perhaps used to be praying. That never guaranteed results.
The "perfect" restaurant means Dan will have the best time with his friends; for me, finding the perfect hairdresser (and yes, I do think he's perfect and I discovered him only after years of following disappointing recommendations) feels like a guarantee of optimum beauty and glamour.
As I talked to more and more people about the quest for the best, I realized that this seems to be true for most of them. One friend explained to me how the false promises of a sportswear brand's marketing exemplified the fruitlessness of a "quest for the best" anything -- only to disappear into another room and return with a freshly delivered pair of its leggings, to show me the false promises up close. Lots of people could be cynical about buying into the promise of a better, brighter life offered by the best version of something, while still sort of hoping it was true. This is not to say that we are powerless to resist a trap coldly set by capitalism or that adults can't engage rationally with marketing. But we all have our weaknesses and our fantasies.
Of course, the idea that a certain type of running leggings would make your life better is ridiculous. The same is true of tacos or mini-fridges -- or vacation sunsets. Or any other number of things which are perhaps only marginally different in quality or offer a difference we aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate.
When we grapple to exert control over these relatively small things, we are seeking to exert some agency over something that feels important to us. Because the idea of how little agency we really have is uncomfortable. No university will guarantee the best four years of your life or a dazzling career thereafter; you can be depressed at Harvard and then unemployed, living with your parents after you graduate. No "best city to retire in" will mean you don't end up divorced and lonely. Happiness is not a thing any amount of research or savvy will guarantee for us.
That's a scary thought. But this is a positive thing, too: Choosing the wrong thing doesn't have to mean the end of the world. In fact, it doesn't have to mean anything. Except whatever we want to make of it.

Prison Did Not Prepare Me for the Horrors of County Jail: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When I was 22 years old, I committed robbery and murder. I pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 45 years, of which I have so far served two decades. During that time, I've experienced the squalor and dangerous conditions of various state prisons. I've lived in a crumbling penitentiary built in the 1800s. I've been put in isolation for weeks on end because of Covid exposure and infection. Still, I was not prepared for what I found when I was transferred to a county jail for two weeks last December.
Along with people serving short sentences for relatively minor offenses, jails house people who are awaiting trial and either didn't get bail or simply couldn't pay it -- people, that is, who have not been convicted of any crime.
Despite that fact, conditions in these facilities are often worse, and sometimes much worse, than those in the prisons where people who are convicted of the worst crimes are confined. Jails throw people together in overcrowded units that may be controlled by the most violent people in the room. Like prisons, jails house a disproportionate number of people experiencing addiction or chronic health conditions but jails lack the resources to treat them and adequate staffing overall. Udi Ofer, a professor at Princeton University who focuses on policing and criminal justice reform, told me that jails "regularly rely on even harsher conditions of confinement" than prisons do.
As a prison writer, journalist and criminal justice activist, I try to communicate to anyone who will listen that the vast majority of incarcerated people will eventually return to their communities. The trauma they suffer on the inside comes with them. Just as a very short time in solitary confinement can cause lasting harm, weeks or months in county jail can have a huge negative impact on people's lives, even after they are released. What happens in jails doesn't stay in jails.
Ethan Frenchman, a lawyer in Washington who advocates on behalf of people with disabilities in jails, told me that while the nation's roughly 1,500 state prisons are operated or overseen by 50 states, the 3,000 or so jails "are operated by who knows how many hundreds or thousands of different jurisdictions," making it extremely hard to get reliable information about what goes on there, or to enforce any kind of accountability.
One data point is unmistakable: suicide rates. Suicides are the leading cause of death in jails, where they occur at a much higher rate than in prisons. Big city jails, like the complex on Rikers Island, are infamous for violence, neglect and overcrowding, but they are not outliers. In fact, research by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics has found that suicide rates in the nation's smallest jails were more than six times as high as those in the largest.
During my recent trip to Pierce County Jail in Tacoma, Wash., where I was sent to await a resentencing hearing that was ultimately delayed, I shared a cell with William Starkovich, a 35-year-old who had never been incarcerated before. He is awaiting trial in Pierce County Jail after an altercation with his siblings over rent money ended in two charges of assault in the first degree.
Mr. Starkovich, who gave me permission to tell his story, has received diagnoses of A.D.H.D., manic depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Since his mental illness can affect his ability to maintain his physical hygiene, he is often a target of ridicule and aggression from other prisoners. He has been assaulted by other prisoners and guards alike. Mr. Starkovich told me that guards insisted on transferring him into an open dorm living unit where he didn't feel safe. When he would not step into the unit, a "code blue" was called, meaning that a prisoner was defying an order. An officer wrestled Mr. Starkovich to the ground, used a Taser on him and handcuffed him.
Reports from jails across the country, from Rikers in New York to Santa Clara County's Main Jail complex, in San Jose, Calif., have shown that mentally ill people are frequently mistreated. Families have filed lawsuits alleging that corrections officers have severely beaten mentally ill people, or let them starve or freeze to death. A 2014 internal investigation at Rikers found that almost 80 percent of the more than 100 prisoners who sustained serious injuries during altercations with corrections officers in 11 months were mentally ill.
Conditions in county jails are bad not just for people suffering from mental illnesses. Prisoners there are often given so little food that they are hungry all the time and must buy more in the commissary. My meals in prison consist of larger portions and far more fruits and vegetables than my meals in jail. To my surprise, I even found myself missing the flavors and variety of prison food. A prisoner in Maine summed up a typical meal in a county jail well when he asked a reporter to "consider eating ground-up gym mat with a little bit of seasoning." But jail commissaries are so expensive that many people who can't afford bail also can't afford anything sold in them. In jail, I saw people beat each other up over commissary food.
Twenty-four packets of Top Ramen noodles that cost $ 6 on Amazon and just under $ 8 in my Washington State prison cost $ 26.40 in the Pierce County Jail's commissary while I was incarcerated there. A small bag of freeze-dried coffee that costs $ 3.34 in state prison costs almost $ 13 in the county jail.
Phone calls to our loved ones, which cost just over a dollar for 20 minutes at a Washington State prison, cost nearly $ 4 from the county jail. An investigation by the Prison Policy Initiative found that in 20 states, phone calls from jails were at least three times as expensive as calls from state prisons. The calls I made from state prison and the county jail are managed by the same company, Securus Technologies, and I see no legitimate reason they should be three times as expensive at one facility.
And not only the day-to-day living conditions are hard. In state and federal prisons across the country, people have access to positive programming to help them better themselves, educate themselves and take responsibility for the crimes they've committed. I've worked for years in prison to earn an associate degree from Seattle Central College, and I am five classes shy of a bachelor's degree in English and sociology. I have also co-founded a nonprofit, received training in restorative justice practices and worked as a restorative justice facilitator.
None of that changes the fact that I took another person's life. I will live with profound regret about that for the rest of mine. However, one day I will return home. Thanks to the positive programs I have been able to participate in, the person who walks out of the prison gates will bear little resemblance to the person who entered them. Many people in prisons are trying to better themselves. For the most part, people in jail are just trying to survive.
We have to care about what's happening in county jails if we are to make our communities safer. Eliminating cash bail, which puts people behind bars simply because they don't have enough cash on hand, would drastically reduce the number of people in county jails. It would also make jails more humane environments for those who need to be detained for legitimate public safety concerns while they work their way through the court system. And research in states and cities across the country has found that eliminating or curtailing the use of cash bail does not have a negative effect on public safety.
Price restrictions that keep private companies from gouging prisoners and their loved ones could help those incarcerated in county jails get the food they need without resorting to violence. With positive changes, people confined in county jails could come out of their stays better equipped to thrive in their communities.
I may be in prison for decades to come, but Mr. Starkovich, like many men I met in county jail, could be released in the coming weeks. He will carry the memory of hunger, violence and fear with him.

Writing Comic Home Truths: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For his first TV series, the best-selling sports and pop culture writer joined with Michael Schur to tell a story based on his adolescence in San Antonio.
SAN ANTONIO -- Shea Serrano wants to show you something.
It has nothing to do with the autobiographical comedy series he created, "Primo" (premiering Friday on Freevee), a coming-of-age story set in San Antonio. It isn't one of his best-selling books, which tackle his favorite subjects -- hip-hop, movies and basketball -- with the fervor of an obsessive fan. It isn't a missive from his popular Twitter account (435,000 followers and counting).
It is a small newspaper clipping from 2021, framed by the owners of his favorite South San Antonio breakfast spot, a neighborhood cafe where the wait is long but the migas are worth it. The story announces that Serrano, a favorite San Antonio son, has won a humanitarian award from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. It has pride of place near the front door of the restaurant, where the owner (understaffed today and on kitchen duty) came out to chat with Serrano earlier this month.
Serrano quietly beamed, soaking in the familiarity and hospitality afforded by his hometown. This is who Serrano is, more than the TV show, the books or the social media profile: a neighborhood guy who stumbled into something for which he has a gift, then put in the hard work to make sure he could keep doing it.
"This is where I was born," he said during a driving tour of this deceptively large city of 1.5 million residents. "This is where I want to die. I just feel like I need to be attached to something, tethered to something. It's nice to have a history with a place or with a thing."
You could scarcely imagine a less Hollywood person working in showbiz. "That's not just true in terms of his demeanor or his personality," said Michael Schur ("Parks and Recreation"), who oversees "Primo." "It's also true of his voice."
"He's not thirsty for fame or success," Schur added. "He's been to Los Angeles three times in his life. He's the most laid back guy I think I've ever met in my life. He's just really comfortable with who he is."
Serrano, 41, didn't plan or expect to be the creator of a major TV series when he first tried writing in his mid-20s -- let alone in collaboration with one of TV's most successful comedy writers. Not long ago, however, his life looked very different.
In 2007, he was a middle school science teacher in Houston. His wife, also a teacher, was pregnant with twins, and doctors ordered strict bed rest. This created a dilemma: How to survive in a big city on one income? Serrano applied to work part-time at Walmart, Target, anywhere that could offer some hours. But nothing was compatible with his teaching schedule.
Growing desperate, he searched Google for jobs he could do from home. Up popped an intriguing option: writing.
He started with small local publications: $ 15 to cover an N.F.L. game; $ 50 to write about a rap show. He started working his way up, using Twitter to pitch larger outlets. He showed a knack for mining his own life for material, and he found that he had retained a lot of pop culture and sports knowledge over the years. He could use that. And he was good at it. Eventually, Bill Simmons tapped Serrano to freelance for Grantland, then hired him as a staff writer in 2015, and again at The Ringer in 2016. He was on his way, and he returned to San Antonio in 2018.
Serrano writes like a gleeful obsessive, a fan who found a way to crash the big leagues. His books, illustrated by the Dallas-based artist Arturo Torres -- including "Hip-Hop (and Other Things)," "Movies (and Other Things)" and "Basketball (and Other Things") -- read like playful arguments among knowledgeable friends. One chapter in the hip-hop book imagines that Jay-Z has a combination telephone/time machine that allows him to call any rapper from any era to solicit a guest verse for any song.
Eventually Serrano grew interested in writing for a medium he had always loved: television. He brainstormed ideas with his wife, including an autobiographical project. When he entered Schur's office for one in a series of showrunner meetings set up by Serrano's agent, he saw walls lined with posters featuring various shows -- "Parks and Recreation," "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," "The Good Place." Hey, Serrano thought. This guy likes the same shows I do. He didn't realize Schur had created or cocreated these series. (Serrano, now: "What an idiot").
Schur was charmed. He also liked Serrano's pitch for "Primo," which he heard for the first time that day: a series about a San Antonio teen, Rafa (nicknamed Primo, which translates to "cousin" in English, and played by Ignacio Diaz-Silverio), who navigates life with his single mother, Drea (Christina Vidal), and five eccentric uncles. Drea works at a corner store, just like Serrano's mother did.
Though set in the present day, "Primo" is based loosely on Serrano's adolescence; in real life, his father was on the scene, but the writers determined that including him would mean less uncle hilarity, Serrano said. Overall, they took an upbeat, family-friendly approach, even as it depicts a family with its fair share of challenges.
Once production began, Vidal said, Serrano was a constant source of energy on set: "He would come on set every day and just walk around giving everybody fist bumps, giving everybody compliments, thanking everybody for being there and just encouraging, encouraging, encouraging."
Post-migas, Serrano, dressed in khakis and a blue hoodie, drove his Tesla to the home of one of the real uncles, Brian Gutierrez. In "Primo," Brian is Ryan (Carlos Santos), a comically proud bank manager who lords his scant white-collar résumé over his blue-collar brothers.
Gutierrez, who works in the energy industry, was the uncle who helped convince the teenage Shea to go to college, much as Ryan does with Rafa. (Serrano, who studied psychology at Sam Houston State University, in Huntsville, was the first in his family to get a degree).
"He was a really good kid," Gutierrez said, "and a really straight arrow." To this day, Serrano said, he has never been drunk. He saw a lot of people in his old neighborhood succumb to addiction and had no interest in joining them.
Which doesn't mean he was an angel. Gutierrez recalled that Serrano and his friends used to come over to Gutierrez's house to play video games. Only later did Gutierrez realize his nephew was also perusing his Playboy collection.
Serrano drove us to his downtown office, a spacious loft in a converted warehouse. The door is inscribed with the name of his independent, online publishing imprint, Halfway Books (a play off a line from the hip-hop group Mobb Deep: "There ain't no such things as halfway crooks"). Inside it's like an erudite teenager's dream. Stacks of books and VHS tapes compete for space with arcade games, including Galaga and N.B.A. Jam. One table is stocked with boxes of unopened trading cards. A shelf holds two basketballs signed by the 1999 and 2005 N.B.A. champion San Antonio Spurs.
"All the stuff I wanted when I was a kid, I'm going to get it now," he said.
Sometimes he can't quite believe any of it.
"Every week, there's one point when I'm like, 'What is happening right now?"' he said. "'What am I doing? Why was I allowed to do this?"'
From Schur's vantage, Serrano's outsider perspective is what makes him special. Schur still remembers his first impression: "This doesn't seem like a guy who's come through any kind of machine," he recalled thinking. "This seems like a guy who blipped into the world of writing from some crazy other place that no one else comes from.
"That's what I thought he was going to be. And that turned out to be exactly what he is."

A Hurdle-Filled Race To Make Computer Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Clark, Don

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For more than 50 years, designers of computer chips mainly used one tactic to boost performance: They shrank electronic components to pack more power onto each piece of silicon.
Then more than a decade ago, engineers at the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices began toying with a radical idea. Instead of designing one big microprocessor with vast numbers of tiny transistors, they conceived of creating one from smaller chips that would be packaged tightly together to work like one electronic brain.
The concept, sometimes called chiplets, caught on in a big way, with AMD, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, IBM and Intel introducing such products. Chiplets rapidly gained traction because smaller chips are cheaper to make, while bundles of them can top the performance of any single slice of silicon.
The strategy, based on advanced packaging technology, has since become an essential tool to enabling progress in semiconductors. And it represents one of the biggest shifts in years for an industry that drives innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and military hardware.
"Packaging is where the action is going to be," said Subramanian Iyer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, who helped pioneer the chiplet concept. "It's happening because there is actually no other way."
The catch is that such packaging, like making chips themselves, is overwhelmingly dominated by companies in Asia. Although the United States accounts for around 12 percent of global semiconductor production, American companies provide just 3 percent of chip packaging, according to IPC, a trade association.
That issue has now landed chiplets in the middle of U.S. industrial policymaking. The CHIPS Act, a $ 52 billion subsidy package that passed last summer, was seen as President Biden's move to reinvigorate domestic chip making by providing money to build more sophisticated factories called "fabs." But part of it was also aimed at stoking advanced packaging factories in the United States to capture more of that essential process.
"As chips get smaller, the way you arrange the chips, which is packaging, is more and more important and we need it done in America," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, said in a speech at Georgetown University in February.
The Commerce Department is now accepting applications for manufacturing grants from the CHIPS Act, including for chip packaging factories. It is also allocating funding to a research program specifically on advanced packaging.
Some chip packaging companies are moving quickly for the funding. One is Integra Technologies in Wichita, Kan., which announced plans for a $ 1.8 billion expansion there but said that was contingent on receiving federal subsidies. Amkor Technology, an Arizona packaging service that has most of its operations in Asia, also said it was talking to customers and government officials about a U.S. production presence.
Packaging chips together isn't a new concept and chiplets are just the latest iteration of that idea, using technological advances that help cram the chips closer together -- either side by side or stacked on top of one another -- along with faster electrical connections between them.
"What is unique about chiplets is the way they are connected electrically," said Richard Otte, the chief executive of Promex Industries, a chip packaging service in Santa Clara, Calif.
Chips can't do anything without a way to connect them with other components, which means they need to be placed in some kind of package that can carry electrical signals. That process starts after factories complete the initial phase of manufacturing, which may create hundreds of chips on a silicon wafer. Once that wafer is sliced apart, individual chips are typically bonded to a key base layer called a substrate, which can conduct electrical signals.
That combination is then coated in protective plastic, forming a package that can be plugged into a circuit board that is essential for connecting to other components in a system.
These processes originally required lots of manual labor, leading Silicon Valley companies to shift packaging to lower-wage countries in Asia more than 50 years ago. Most chips are typically flown to packaging services in countries like Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and China.
Since then, packaging advances have gained importance because of the diminishing returns from Moore's Law, the shorthand expression for chip miniaturization that for decades drove progress in Silicon Valley. It is named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, whose 1965 paper described how rapidly companies had doubled the number of transistors on a typical chip, which improved performance at a lower cost.
But these days, smaller transistors are not necessarily cheaper, partly because building factories for leading-edge chips can cost $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion. Big, complex chips also are costly to design and tend to have more manufacturing defects, even as companies in fields like generative A.I. want more transistors than can currently be packed onto the biggest chips manufacturing machines allow.
"The natural response to that is putting more things in a package," said Anirudh Devgan, chief executive of Cadence Design Systems, whose software is used to design conventional chips as well as chiplet-style products.
Synopsys, a rival, said it was tracking more than 140 customer projects based on packaging multiple chips together. As much as 80 percent of microprocessors will use chiplet-style designs by 2027, according to the market research firm Yole Group.
Today, companies typically design all the chiplets in a package along with their own connection technology. But industry groups are working on technical standards so companies can more easily assemble products from chiplets that come from different makers.
The new technology is mostly used now for extreme performance. Intel recently introduced a processor called Ponte Vecchio with 47 chiplets that will be used in a powerful supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, which is near Chicago.
In January, AMD disclosed plans for an unusual product, the MI300, that combines chiplets for standard calculations with others designed for computer graphics, along with a large pool of memory chips. That processor, intended to power another advanced supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has 146 billion transistors, compared with tens of billions for most advanced conventional chips.
Sam Naffziger, an AMD senior vice president, said it wasn't a slam-dunk for the company to bet its chip business for server computers on chiplets. Packaging complexities were a major hurdle, he said, which were eventually overcome with help from an undisclosed partner.
But chiplets have paid off for AMD. The company has sold more than 12 million chips based on the idea since 2017, according to Mercury Research, and has become a major player in microprocessors that power the web.
Packaging services still need others to supply the substrates that chiplets require to connect to circuit boards and one another. One company driving the chiplet boom is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which already makes chips for AMD and hundreds of others and offers an advanced silicon-based substrate called an interposer.
Intel has been developing similar technology, as well as enhancing less-expensive conventional plastic substrates in an approach favored by some such as the Silicon Valley start-up Eliyan. Intel has also been developing new packaging prototypes under a Pentagon program and hopes to win CHIPs Act support for a new pilot packaging plant.
But the United States has no major makers of those substrates, which are primarily produced in Asia and evolved from technologies used in manufacturing circuit boards. Many U.S. companies have also left that business, another worry that industry groups hope will spur federal funding to help board suppliers start making substrates.
In March, Mr. Biden issued a determination that advanced packaging and domestic circuit board production were essential for national security, and announced $ 50 million in Defense Production Act funding for American and Canadian companies in those fields.
Even with such subsidies, assembling all the elements required to reduce U.S. dependence on Asian companies "is a huge challenge," said Andreas Olofsson, who ran a Defense Department research effort in the field before founding a packaging start-up called Zero ASIC. "You don't have suppliers. You don't have a work force. You don't have equipment. You have to sort of start from scratch."

SAN FRANCISCO — For more than 50 years, designers of computer chips mainly used one tactic to boost performance: They shrank electronic components to pack more power onto each piece of silicon.
Then more than a decade ago, engineers at the chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices began toying with a radical idea. Instead of designing one big microprocessor with vast numbers of tiny transistors, they conceived of creating one from smaller chips that would be packaged tightly together to work like one electronic brain.
The concept, sometimes called chiplets, caught on in a big way, with AMD, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, IBM and Intel introducing such products. Chiplets rapidly gained traction because smaller chips are cheaper to make, while bundles of them can top the performance of any single slice of silicon.
The strategy, based on advanced packaging technology, has since become an essential tool to enabling progress in semiconductors. And it represents one of the biggest shifts in years for an industry that drives innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and military hardware.
“Packaging is where the action is going to be,” said Subramanian Iyer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at UCLA who helped pioneer the chiplet concept. “It’s happening because there is actually no other way.”
The catch is that such packaging, like making chips themselves, is overwhelmingly dominated by companies in Asia. Although the United States accounts for around 12% of global semiconductor production, American companies provide just 3% of chip packaging, according to IPC, a trade association.
That issue has now landed chiplets in the middle of U.S. industrial policymaking. The CHIPS Act, a $52 billion subsidy package that passed last summer, was seen as President Joe Biden’s move to reinvigorate domestic chipmaking by providing money to build more sophisticated factories called “fabs.” But part of it was also aimed at stoking advanced packaging factories in the United States to capture more of that essential process.
“As chips get smaller, the way you arrange the chips, which is packaging, is more and more important and we need it done in America,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University in February.
The Commerce Department is now accepting applications for manufacturing grants from the CHIPS Act, including for chip packaging factories. It is also allocating funding to a research program specifically for advanced packaging.
Some chip packaging companies are moving quickly for the funding. One is Integra Technologies in Wichita, Kansas, which announced plans for a $1.8 billion expansion there but said that was contingent on receiving federal subsidies. Amkor Technology, an Arizona packaging service that has most of its operations in Asia, also said it was talking to customers and government officials about a U.S. production presence.
Packaging chips together isn’t a new concept and chiplets are just the latest iteration of that idea, using technological advances that help cram the chips closer together — either side by side or stacked on top of one another — along with faster electrical connections between them.
“What is unique about chiplets is the way they are connected electrically,” said Richard Otte, CEO of Promex Industries, a chip packaging service in Santa Clara, California.
Chips can’t do anything without a way to connect them with other components, which means they need to be placed in some kind of package that can carry electrical signals. That process starts after factories complete the initial phase of manufacturing, which may create hundreds of chips on a silicon wafer. Once that wafer is sliced apart, individual chips are typically bonded to a key base layer called a substrate, which can conduct electrical signals.
That combination is then coated in protective plastic, forming a package that can be plugged into a circuit board that is essential for connecting to other components in a system.
These processes originally required lots of manual labor, leading Silicon Valley companies to shift packaging to lower-wage countries in Asia more than 50 years ago. Most chips are typically flown to packaging services in countries like Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and China.
Since then, packaging advances have gained importance because of the diminishing returns from Moore’s Law, the shorthand expression for chip miniaturization that for decades drove progress in Silicon Valley. It is named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, whose 1965 paper described how rapidly companies had doubled the number of transistors on a typical chip, which improved performance at a lower cost.
But these days, smaller transistors are not necessarily cheaper, partly because building factories for leading-edge chips can cost $10 billion to $20 billion. Big, complex chips also are costly to design and tend to have more manufacturing defects, even as companies in fields like generative AI want more transistors than can currently be packed onto the biggest chips manufacturing machines allow.
“The natural response to that is putting more things in a package,” said Anirudh Devgan, CEO of Cadence Design Systems, whose software is used to design conventional chips as well as chiplet-style products.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: GROWING UP BETWEEN Rio de Janeiro and the rural interior of Minas Gerais, a rugged, sprawling state in southeastern Brazil, the architect Mariana Schmidt moved often with her father, an engineer working on the state highway system. Brazil's second most populous state, Minas Gerais grew during an early 18th-century gold rush that brought in speculators and enslaved people, a forced migration that continued into the next century as agriculture supplanted mining. Though raised in the shadows of Modernism -- her grandfather, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, worked in the 1950s on the construction of the exactingly planned Brasília, which would become the national capital in 1960 -- Schmidt, 40, was more interested in Minas Gerais's farmsteads and quilombos, settlements founded by those who escaped slavery before it was abolished in 1888. She loved the warmth of the lime-slaked village houses and the efficiency of the rough-hewn wooden furniture. Life in rural Minas Gerais moved slower than it did in São Paulo, the metropolis where she's resided since 2005. "The days feel longer. People wake up early, they sleep early, they live according to the light," she says. "All my references are about that simplicity."
Since founding her studio, MNMA, in 2016, Schmidt has incorporated the earthiness of those remembered landscapes into homes and interiors around São Paulo. Within a city shaped by its ruthless commitment to the future, that's a transgressive decision: For the gallery Superfície, completed in 2018 in the Jardim Paulista neighborhood, she disrupted the austerity of a white cube with a single block of honed granite, placed as the bottommost step in a polished concrete stairwell. A year later, for the nearby boutique Haight, Schmidt carved protean alcoves into the walls to create a cavelike shelving system for handbags. Even her company's name, an abbreviation of the Portuguese word for "minimum," takes aim at a culture that valorizes maximum scale and complexity, and she tries to privilege instead "the smallest grain of architecture," she says.
No project distills this approach more clearly than her own two-bedroom apartment in the city's Higienópolis neighborhood. Here, calculated flaws make every surface feel alive: Polished concrete floors, laced with hairline cracks, glow a luminous gold, tinted by sand from the northeastern state of Bahia. She added the same pigment to the plaster spread across the walls and ceilings, creating pebbled surfaces that catch and refract the shifting daylight.
Schmidt moved to São Paulo, a city defined by concrete and asphalt, after completing a degree in psychology and realizing almost immediately that she had no interest in joining the field. Though she hadn't spent much of her life thinking about the family building vocation, her adoptive city's alien beauty ignited her interest in design; within a year, she'd enrolled at the University of São Paulo for a second bachelor's degree, this one in architecture. But to her, the curriculum focused too much on Brazil's towering Modernist heritage: "We never talked about natural pigments or building with earth," she says. "About ancestral architecture or the African diaspora."
A few years after graduating in 2014, Schmidt traveled to Mozambique and was struck by its resonances with Minas Gerais, which had been so clearly shaped by displaced Africans. In the years since, she's returned to the continent whenever she can, studying the adobe vaults of Nubia in modern-day Sudan and the elaborate painted clay facades of the Kassena people's earthen homes in Burkina Faso. As her practice has evolved, she's increasingly incorporated centuries-old vernacular craft techniques, blending geometric rigor with rustic tactility. In her own home -- originally a characterless box -- the use of sand, wood and clay seem to "make the time pass more slowly," she says. "Even concrete needs to breathe."
SCHMIDT BOUGHT THE fourth-floor apartment in 2020 under unhappy circumstances. It was the height of the pandemic and she had recently ended two long-term relationships, one with a romantic partner, the other with the co-founder of MNMA. "I told the broker, 'I'm in a bad moment, I want to break everything apart,"' Schmidt says. The agent then brought her to an unprepossessing 1970s apartment block, unusually bland in a neighborhood known for its leafy streets and iconic Modernist towers. "The place was ugly. No one wanted it," Schmidt recalls. "So I took it and started to work."
Though nearly 2,700 square feet, the apartment felt cramped, its floor plan fractured by a windowless foyer, a dim living room, three bathrooms, three bedrooms and a dining room-kitchen with attached areas for a live-in housekeeper. Schmidt removed walls, transforming the service quarters into a kitchen and eliminating the foyer completely. She placed her own bedroom and a small office on a street-facing side of the apartment, separating them from the public spaces and a bedroom suite for her 15-year-old daughter, Ana, with a pivoting panel plastered to match the walls.
Meditative and monochromatic in shades of bone and burnished wood, the home is thoughtfully but sparsely decorated with objects Schmidt has collected from Peru, Mexico, Ethiopia and the Amazon, juxtaposed against contemporary artworks and iconic pieces of midcentury furniture. In the dining room, a notched log from Mali -- once an exterior staircase for a village home -- shares space with a set of six Carlo Hauner dining chairs from the 1950s and a 2020 work by Schmidt's neighbor the visual artist Mano Penalva that cascades down a nearby wall in layered loops of wooden beads used for, among other things, taxi drivers' seat covers. In the adjacent living room, the disassembled components of a colonial-era grain mill from Minas Gerais have become a series of wooden totems, concluding at Schmidt's most prized possession, a wooden chair designed by the Italian-born Brazilian architect and industrial designer Lina Bo Bardi for São Paulo's SESC Pompéia (an adaptation, completed in 1976, of a pre-existing factory that's now a cultural center).
From the generations-old grinding stone that Schmidt brought back from Mexico to the delicate paintings of household items (a floor lamp; a chair) on sculpted porcelain tiles received when she exchanged works with the São Paulo-based artist Brisa Noronha, the objects speak to Schmidt's interest in "ancestry and work," she says. In celebrating flaws -- like the shards of a broken clay vessel spread across her dining room table -- Schmidt closes the breach between city and country, between technologies new and old, between artists who are named and those whose names we'll never know. "Architecture is about life," she says. Cracks aren't a sign of decline but of progress.

Delete Race Remarks? An Author Says No.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The case, involving Scholastic, led to an outcry among authors and became an example of how the culture wars behind a surge in book banning in schools has reached publishers.
It was the most personal story that Maggie Tokuda-Hall had ever written: the tale of how her grandparents met and fell in love at an incarceration camp in Idaho that held Japanese Americans during World War II.
The book, called "Love in the Library," is aimed at 6- to 9-year-olds. Published last year by a small children's publisher, Candlewick Press, it drew glowing reviews, but sales were modest. So Tokuda-Hall was thrilled when Scholastic, a publishing giant that distributes books and resources in 90 percent of schools, said last month it wanted to license her book for use in classrooms.
When Tokuda-Hall read the details of the offer, she felt deflated -- then outraged. Scholastic wanted her to delete references to racism in America from her author's note, in which she addresses readers directly. The decision was wrenching, Tokuda-Hall said, but she turned Scholastic down and went public, describing her predicament in a blog post and a Twitter post that drew more than five million views.
Tokuda-Hall's revelations sparked an outcry among children's book authors and brought intense scrutiny to the editorial process of the world's largest children's publisher. The blowup came at a time when culture wars are fueling efforts to ban books in schools -- particularly books on race or sexuality -- and raising questions about whether already published works should be re-edited to remove potentially offensive content.
"We all see what's happening with this rising culture of book bans," Tokuda-Hall said. "If we all know that the largest children's publisher in the country, the one with the most access to schools, is capitulating behind closed doors and asking authors to change their works to accommodate those kinds of demands, there's no way you as a marginalized author can find an audience."
Scholastic moved quickly to contain the fallout. It apologized to Tokuda-Hall and the illustrator, Yas Imamura, and offered to publish the book with the original author's note. Tokuda-Hall turned them down, saying that she was not convinced by the company's efforts.
The company also delayed production of the collection that would have included "Love in the Library," which was likely to include around 150 books by or about Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, while they evaluate what went wrong.
In the case of Tokuda-Hall's book, Scholastic's proposed edits included deleting a sentence where she contextualized her grandparents' experience as part of "the deeply American tradition of racism." The company also asked for the removal of a paragraph connecting bigotry against Japanese Americans to current and past manifestations of racism, in which Tokuda-Hall describes a culture that "allows the police to murder Black people" and "keeps children in cages on our border."
In an email to Tokuda-Hall, which was shared with The Times, Candlewick conveyed Scholastic's request and the company's concern that schools might shy away from purchasing a book with such a frank comment about racism during this "especially politically sensitive" moment. On Amazon and Goodreads, some readers have complained that Tokuda-Hall's message is too political for its young audience.
Shortly after Tokuda-Hall posted about the incident on April 12, several authors and educators who were brought on by Scholastic to consult on and curate the series that would have included Tokuda-Hall's book condemned the company's actions, and demanded an overhaul of the editorial process.
One of the authors who consulted on the collection, Sayantani DasGupta, resigned in protest. "They're pre-emptively censoring the collection, saying, 'Hey, we're going to put out diverse stories, but we're only going to put them out in the most palatable form'," DasGupta said.
Similar controversies have arisen recently around efforts to remove discussions of racism from school textbooks. One textbook publisher, Studies Weekly, faced criticism after it revised an elementary school textbook so that Rosa Parks's story no longer included references to segregation or race.
But many were shocked to hear that a leading commercial publisher like Scholastic was seeking such revisions.
More than 650 librarians and educators, who make up a large segment of Scholastic's customer base, sent a petition to Scholastic demanding that the company release the book in its original form and "take public responsibility for the decision to censor a book."
Jillian Heise, an elementary school librarian in Wisconsin who organized the petition, said that the original author's note was something that young children -- many of whom experience racism in their daily lives -- could grapple with.
"Kids are capable of understanding at a simple level that when we treat people differently because of who they are, or how they identify, or what they look like, that that's not fair," she said. That conversation, she continued, "helps their self-perception and perception of the world develop with empathy."
In an interview on Thursday, Scholastic's chief executive, Peter Warwick, said the company will evaluate "all aspects of our curatorial approach."
"Scholastic has done extensive publishing of diverse voices and stories, and the fact that this incident happened in the context of our diverse publishing is particularly disturbing to all of us," Warwick said.
After Tokuda-Hall's complaint, the company decided within 24 hours to delay the entire collection, Warwick said. It has brought in two outside experts to examine how the collection was curated and edited. The review will look at not only the series that included "Love in the Library," but the entire "Rising Voices" program, which includes other collections like "Elevating Latino Stories" and "Celebrating Girls of Color."
The review will examine if and how other books were edited to remove potentially polarizing ideas, Warwick confirmed.
Another author whose book was going to be featured in the same series as "Love in the Library" said that her work was edited to rephrase a line, removing an idea that some might view as politically sensitive. When Scholastic requested the change, it explained in an email to the author's publisher that it was because of its concerns about the political climate that is driving censorship in schools, the author said.
The author asked to remain anonymous and to shield any identifying details about the edit because of an ongoing relationship with Scholastic.
The debate comes as Scholastic aims to maintain its foothold in schools, where it typically sells more than 100 million books to 35 million children a year through its fairs.
Like other publishers, Scholastic has made an effort to increase the diversity of its authors and titles in recent years. It has published groundbreaking works that feature L.G.B.T.Q. characters and tackle complex issues about race, gender, sexuality and cultural identity, including best sellers like "Heartstopper," a graphic novel series about a romance between two high school boys.
Scholastic also licenses and distributes books from other publishers for its school-focused programs, which include its clubs and fairs and education division. Two publishing executives at other companies who have direct knowledge of licensing at Scholastic said that it is not unusual for the company to request changes to an already published text.
Typically, the requested changes involve removing crass language or violence, one publishing executive told The Times. An executive at another children's publishing company that regularly licenses books to Scholastic said that on several occasions, Scholastic had asked for changes intended to tone down politically sensitive or potentially polarizing content. Both executives spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss editorial processes that are typically confidential.
It's unclear how Scholastic's editorial practices will change in the wake of the current controversy. Some authors whose work was selected for the same collection as "Love in the Library" are closely watching Scholastic's next moves.
"This is a collection of stories that needs a wider audience," said Katrina Moore, whose book "Teeny Houdini: The Disappearing Act" was supposed to be included. "I would love to continue to participate in the collection, but I do need to feel good about how they are moving forward. So I'm watching, but I'm hopeful."

It was the most personal story that Maggie Tokuda-Hall had ever written: the tale of how her grandparents met and fell in love at an incarceration camp in Idaho that held Japanese Americans during World War II.
The book, called “Love in the Library,” is aimed at 6- to 9-year-olds. Published last year by a small children’s publisher, Candlewick Press, it drew glowing reviews, but sales were modest. So Tokuda-Hall was thrilled when Scholastic, a publishing giant that distributes books and resources in 90% of schools, said last month it wanted to license her book for use in classrooms.
When Tokuda-Hall read the details of the offer, she felt deflated — then outraged. Scholastic wanted her to delete references to racism in America from her author’s note, in which she addresses readers directly. The decision was wrenching, Tokuda-Hall said, but she turned Scholastic down and went public, describing her predicament in a blog post and a Twitter post that drew more than 5 million views.
Tokuda-Hall’s revelations sparked an outcry among children’s book authors and brought intense scrutiny to the editorial process of the world’s largest children’s publisher. The blowup came at a time when culture wars are fueling efforts to ban books in schools — particularly books on race or sexuality — and raising questions about whether already published works should be reedited to remove potentially offensive content.
“We all see what’s happening with this rising culture of book bans,” Tokuda-Hall said. “If we all know that the largest children’s publisher in the country, the one with the most access to schools, is capitulating behind closed doors and asking authors to change their works to accommodate those kinds of demands, there’s no way you as a marginalized author can find an audience.”
Scholastic moved quickly to contain the fallout. It apologized to Tokuda-Hall and the illustrator, Yas Imamura, and offered to publish the book with the original author’s note. Tokuda-Hall turned them down, saying that she was not convinced by the company’s efforts.
The company also delayed production of the collection that would have included “Love in the Library,” which was likely to include around 150 books by or about Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, while it evaluates what went wrong.
In the case of Tokuda-Hall’s book, Scholastic’s proposed edits included deleting a sentence where she contextualized her grandparents’ experience as part of “the deeply American tradition of racism.” The company also asked for the removal of a paragraph connecting bigotry against Japanese Americans to current and past manifestations of racism, in which Tokuda-Hall describes a culture that “allows the police to murder Black people” and “keeps children in cages on our border.”
In an email to Tokuda-Hall, which was shared with The New York Times, Candlewick conveyed Scholastic’s request and the company’s concern that schools might shy away from purchasing a book with such a frank comment about racism during this “especially politically sensitive” moment. On Amazon and Goodreads, some readers have complained that Tokuda-Hall’s message is too political for its young audience.
Shortly after Tokuda-Hall posted about the incident April 12, several authors and educators who were brought on by Scholastic to consult on and curate the series that would have included Tokuda-Hall’s book condemned the company’s actions and demanded an overhaul of the editorial process.
One of the authors who consulted on the collection, Sayantani DasGupta, resigned in protest. “They’re preemptively censoring the collection, saying, ‘Hey, we’re going to put out diverse stories, but we’re only going to put them out in the most palatable form,’” DasGupta said.
Similar controversies have arisen recently around efforts to remove discussions of racism from school textbooks. One textbook publisher, Studies Weekly, faced criticism after it revised an elementary school textbook so that Rosa Parks’ story no longer included references to segregation or race.
But many were shocked to hear that a leading commercial publisher like Scholastic was seeking such revisions.
More than 650 librarians and educators, who make up a large segment of Scholastic’s customer base, sent a petition to Scholastic demanding that the company release the book in its original form and “take public responsibility for the decision to censor a book.”
Jillian Heise, an elementary school librarian in Wisconsin who organized the petition, said that the original author’s note was something that young children — many of whom experience racism in their daily lives — could grapple with.
“Kids are capable of understanding at a simple level that when we treat people differently because of who they are, or how they identify, or what they look like, that that’s not fair,” she said. That conversation, she continued, “helps their self-perception and perception of the world develop with empathy.”
In an interview Thursday, Scholastic’s CEO, Peter Warwick, said the company will evaluate “all aspects of our curatorial approach.”
“Scholastic has done extensive publishing of diverse voices and stories, and the fact that this incident happened in the context of our diverse publishing is particularly disturbing to all of us,” Warwick said.
After Tokuda-Hall’s complaint, the company decided within 24 hours to delay the entire collection, Warwick said. It has brought in two outside experts to examine how the collection was curated and edited. The review will look at not only the series that included “Love in the Library” but also the entire “Rising Voices” program, which includes other collections like “Elevating Latino Stories” and “Celebrating Girls of Color.”
The review will examine if and how other books were edited to remove potentially polarizing ideas, Warwick confirmed.
Another author whose book was going to be featured in the same series as “Love in the Library” said that her work was edited to rephrase a line, removing an idea that some might view as politically sensitive. When Scholastic requested the change, it explained in an email to the author’s publisher that it was because of its concerns about the political climate that is driving censorship in schools, the author said.
The author asked to remain anonymous and to shield any identifying details about the edit because of an ongoing relationship with Scholastic.
The debate comes as Scholastic aims to maintain its foothold in schools, where it typically sells more than 100 million books to 35 million children a year through its fairs.

Lengthy Strike Looks Likely for Hollywood Writers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The writers and entertainment companies remain far apart on several key issues, including money, and the standoff could last for months.
It's not just posturing: As screenwriters continue their strike against Hollywood companies, the two sides remain a galaxy apart, portending a potentially long and destructive standoff.
"Any hope that this would be fast has faded," said Tara Kole, a founding partner of JSSK, an entertainment law firm that counts Emma Stone, Adam McKay and Halle Berry as clients. "I hate to say it, but it's going to be a while."
The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, went on strike on Tuesday after contract negotiations with studios, streaming services and networks failed. By the end of the week, as companies punched back at union in the news media, and striking writers celebrated the disruption of shows filming from finished scripts, Doug Creutz, an analyst at TD Cowen, told clients that a "protracted affair seems likely." He defined protracted as more than three months -- perhaps long enough to affect the Emmy Awards, scheduled for Sept. 18, and delay the fall TV season.
The W.G.A. has vowed to stay on strike for as long as it takes. "The week has shown, I think, just how committed and fervent writers' feelings are about all of this," Chris Keyser, a chair of the W.G.A. negotiating committee, said in an interview on Friday. "They're going to stay out until something changes because they can't afford not to."
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, streaming services and networks, has maintained that it hopes "to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry." Privately, however, member companies say they are prepared to weather a strike of at least 100 days. The most recent writers strike, which began in 2007 and ended in 2008, lasted that long.
"It's fair to say there's a pretty big gap," Bob Bakish, chief executive of Paramount Global, told analysts and investors on a conference call on Thursday. Paramount and its CBS subsidiary are prepared to "manage through this strike," he added, "even if it's for an extended duration."
Both sides have insisted that the other needs to make the first move to restart talks. None are scheduled. For the moment, media companies have turned to contract renewal negotiations with the Directors Guild of America, which start on Wednesday. That contract expires on June 30.
Like writers, directors want more money, especially regarding residual payments (a type of royalty) from streaming services, which have rapidly expanded overseas. Before streaming, writers and directors (and other creative contributors, including actors) could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed, whether that was for syndication, an international deal or DVD sales. In the streaming era, as global services like Netflix and Amazon have been reluctant to license their series, those distribution arms have been cut off.
In addition to raises, however, writers want media companies -- Netflix, in particular -- to make structural changes to the way they do business. The companies -- Netflix, in particular -- say that is a bridge too far.
The W.G.A. has proposals for mandatory staffing and employment guarantees, for instance. The union contends that the proposals are necessary because entertainment companies are increasingly relying on what is known in Hollywood slang as a miniroom. In one example of a miniroom, studios hire a small group of writers to develop a series and write several scripts over two or three months. Because they have not officially ordered the series, studios pay writers less than if they were in a large, traditional writers' room.
And given the relatively short duration of the position, those writers are then left scrambling to find another job if the show is not picked up. If a show does get a green light, fewer writers are sometimes hired because blueprints and several scripts have already been created.
"While the W.G.A. has argued" that mandatory staffing and duration of employment "is necessary to preserve the writers' room, it is in reality a hiring quota that is incompatible with the creative nature of our industry," the studio alliance said in a statement on Thursday.
Writers responded with indignation. "We don't need the companies protecting us from our own creativity," said Mr. Keyser, whose writing credits include "Party of Five" and "The Last Tycoon." "What we need is protection from them essentially eliminating the job of the writer."
Writers also want companies to agree to guarantee that artificial intelligence will not encroach on writers' credits and compensation. Such guarantees are a nonstarter, the studio alliance has said, instead suggesting an annual meeting on advances in the technology. "A.I. raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone," the studios said on Thursday. "It's something that requires a lot more discussion, which we have committed to doing."
Mr. Keyser's response: Go pound sand.
"This is exactly what they offered us with the internet in 2007 -- let's chat about it every year, until it progresses so far that there's nothing we can do about it," he said.
In that case, have fun on the picket lines, studio executives have said privately: It's going to be hot out there in July.
Over the last week, media companies conveyed an air of business as usual. On Thursday, HBO hosted a red carpet premiere for a documentary, while the Fox broadcast network announced a survivalist reality show called "Stars on Mars" hosted by William Shatner.
"3 ... 2 ... 1 ... LIFT OFF!" the network's promotional materials read.
With the exception of late-night shows, which immediately went dark, Mr. Bakish assured Wall Street, "consumers really won't notice anything for a while." Networks and streaming services have a large amount of banked content. Reality shows, news programs and some scripted series made by overseas companies are unaffected by the strike. Most movies scheduled for release this year are well past the writing stage.
Shares climbed on Friday for every company involved with the failed contract talks; investors tend to like it when costs go down, which is what happens when production slows, as during a strike. If the strike drags into July, analysts pointed out, studios can exit pricey deals with writers under "force majeure" clauses of contracts.
"The sorry news for writers is that, in declaring a strike, they may in fact be helping the streaming giants and their parent companies," Luke Landis, a media and internet analyst at SBV MoffettNathanson, wrote in a report on Wednesday.
Writers, however, succeeded in making things difficult for studios over the first week. Apple TV+ was forced to postpone the premiere of "Still," about Michael J. Fox and his struggle with Parkinson's disease, because Mr. Fox refused to cross a picket line. In Los Angeles, writers picketed the Apple TV+ set for "Loot," starring Maya Rudolph, causing taping to halt. In New York, similar actions disrupted production for shows like "Billions," the Showtime drama. Other affected shows included "Stranger Things" on Netflix, "Hacks" on HBO Max and the MTV Movie & TV Awards telecast on Sunday, which went forward without a host after Drew Barrymore pulled out, citing the strike.
"The corporations have gotten too greedy," Sasha Stewart, a writer for the Netflix documentary series, "Amend: The Fight for America" as well as "The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore," said from a picket line last week. "They want to break us. We have to show them we will not be broken."
Writers went into the strike energized. But a rally at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Wednesday seemed to supercharge the group, in part because leaders from other entertainment unions turned out to support them -- and in fiery fashion. During the 2007 strike, writers were largely left to stand alone, while a union representing camera operators, set electricians, makeup artists and other crafts workers blasted the writers for causing "devastation."
Ellen Stutzman, chief negotiator for the writers, received a standing ovation from the estimated 1,800 people who attended the rally. During the session, writers suggested expanding picket lines to the homes of studio chief executives and starting a public campaign to get people to cancel their streaming subscriptions.
Some writers realized that Teamsters locals, which represent the many drivers that studios rely on to transport materials (and people), would not cross picket lines. So they started to picket before dawn to intercept them. (The W.G.A. has advised a 9 a.m. starting time.) At least one show, the Apple TV+ dystopian workplace drama "Severance," was forced to shut down production on Friday as a result of Teamsters drivers' refusing to cross.

It’s not just posturing: As screenwriters continue their strike against Hollywood companies, the two sides remain a galaxy apart, portending a potentially long and destructive standoff.
“Any hope that this would be fast has faded,” said Tara Kole, a founding partner of JSSK, an entertainment law firm that counts Emma Stone, Adam McKay and Halle Berry as clients. “I hate to say it, but it’s going to be a while.”
The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, went on strike Tuesday after contract negotiations with studios, streaming services and networks failed. By the end of the week, as companies punched back at the union in the news media, and striking writers celebrated the disruption of shows filming from finished scripts, Doug Creutz, an analyst at TD Cowen, told clients that a “protracted affair seems likely.” He defined protracted as more than three months — perhaps long enough to affect the Emmy Awards, scheduled for Sept. 18, and delay the fall TV season.
The WGA has vowed to stay on strike for as long as it takes. “The week has shown, I think, just how committed and fervent writers’ feelings are about all of this,” Chris Keyser, a chair of the WGA negotiating committee, said in an interview Friday. “They’re going to stay out until something changes because they can’t afford not to.”
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, streaming services and networks, has maintained that it hopes “to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry.” Privately, however, member companies say they are prepared to weather a strike of at least 100 days. The most recent writers strike, which began in 2007 and ended in 2008, lasted that long.
“It’s fair to say there’s a pretty big gap,” Bob Bakish, CEO of Paramount Global, told analysts and investors on a conference call Thursday. Paramount and its CBS subsidiary are prepared to “manage through this strike,” he added, “even if it’s for an extended duration.”
Both sides have insisted that the other needs to make the first move to restart talks. None are scheduled. For the moment, media companies have turned to contract renewal negotiations with the Directors Guild of America, which start Wednesday. That contract expires June 30.
Like writers, directors want more money, especially regarding residual payments (a type of royalty) from streaming services, which have rapidly expanded overseas. Before streaming, writers and directors (and other creative contributors, including actors) could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed, whether that was for syndication, an international deal or DVD sales. In the streaming era, as global services including Netflix and Amazon have been reluctant to license their series, those distribution arms have been cut off.
In addition to raises, however, writers want media companies — Netflix, in particular — to make structural changes to the way they do business. The companies — Netflix, in particular — say that is a bridge too far.
The WGA has proposals for mandatory staffing and employment guarantees, for instance. The union contends that the proposals are necessary because entertainment companies are increasingly relying on what is known in Hollywood slang as a miniroom. In one example of a miniroom, studios hire a small group of writers to develop a series and write several scripts over two or three months. Because they have not officially ordered the series, studios pay writers less than if they were in a large, traditional writers’ room.
And given the relatively short duration of the positions, those writers are then left scrambling to find another job if the show is not picked up. If a show does get a green light, fewer writers are sometimes hired because blueprints and several scripts have been created.
“While the WGA has argued” that mandatory staffing and duration of employment “is necessary to preserve the writers’ room, it is in reality a hiring quota that is incompatible with the creative nature of our industry,” the studio alliance said in a statement Thursday.
Writers responded with indignation. “We don’t need the companies protecting us from our own creativity,” said Keyser, whose writing credits include “Party of Five” and “The Last Tycoon.” “What we need is protection from them essentially eliminating the job of the writer.”
Writers also want companies to agree to guarantee that artificial intelligence will not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation. Such guarantees are a nonstarter, the studio alliance has said, instead suggesting an annual meeting on advances in the technology. “AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone,” the studios said Thursday. “It’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we have committed to doing.”
Keyser’s response: Go pound sand.
“This is exactly what they offered us with the internet in 2007 — let’s chat about it every year, until it progresses so far that there’s nothing we can do about it,” he said.
In that case, have fun on the picket lines, studio executives have said privately: It’s going to be hot out there in July.
Over the past week, media companies conveyed an air of business as usual. On Thursday, HBO hosted a red carpet premiere for a documentary, while the Fox broadcast network announced a survivalist reality show called “Stars on Mars” hosted by William Shatner.
“3 … 2 … 1 … LIFT OFF!” the network’s promotional materials read.
With the exception of late-night shows, which immediately went dark, Bakish assured Wall Street, “consumers really won’t notice anything for a while.” Networks and streaming services have a large amount of banked content. Reality shows, news programs and some scripted series made by overseas companies are unaffected by the strike. Most movies scheduled for release this year are well past the writing stage.
Shares climbed Friday for every company involved with the failed contract talks; investors tend to like it when costs go down, which is what happens when production slows, as during a strike. If the strike drags into July, analysts pointed out, studios can exit pricey deals with writers under “force majeure” clauses of contracts.
“The sorry news for writers is that, in declaring a strike, they may in fact be helping the streaming giants and their parent companies,” Luke Landis, a media and internet analyst at SBV MoffettNathanson, wrote in a report Wednesday.
Writers, however, succeeded in making things difficult for studios over the first week. Apple TV+ was forced to postpone the premiere of “Still,” about Michael J. Fox and his struggle with Parkinson’s disease, because Fox refused to cross a picket line. In Los Angeles, writers picketed the Apple TV+ set for “Loot,” starring Maya Rudolph, causing taping to halt. In New York, similar actions disrupted production for shows such as “Billions,” the Showtime drama. Other affected shows included “Stranger Things” on Netflix, “Hacks” on HBO Max and the MTV Movie & TV Awards telecast Sunday, which was scheduled to go forward without a host after Drew Barrymore pulled out, citing the strike.
“The corporations have gotten too greedy,” Sasha Stewart, a writer for the Netflix documentary series, “Amend: The Fight for America” as well as “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore,” said from a picket line last week. “They want to break us. We have to show them we will not be broken.”

Shein Pours On The Charm: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In its decade of doing business, Shein has grown rapidly by winning over shoppers with its tough-to-beat prices and kaleidoscope of new merchandise. Along the way, the e-commerce retailer has also gained vocal critics who have questioned, among other things, its connection to China, accused it of stealing designers' works and pointed to how its cheap merchandise contributes to environmental waste.
Shein, for the most part, has been tight-lipped through it all. Now, the company is looking to change the perception of its business and practices ahead of its expected filing for an initial public offering.
It has poured millions of dollars into initiatives that seek to address the longstanding criticisms as a way to earn good will. In the process, Shein is positioning itself as a retail juggernaut with whom industry stalwarts will inevitably have to share space.
"We're trying to engage with lots of stakeholders," Peter Day, Shein's head of strategy and corporate affairs, said in an interview. "We're an emerging brand, and we've done a lot of things well. There are some things that we still need to learn how to do, and the best way to do it is to talk to the community."
Shein has one of the most downloaded mobile apps, has a dedicated and active hashtag on TikTok (#Sheinhaul) and is right behind Amazon and Nike when it comes to Gen Z's favorite e-commerce websites. It sells items like mesh dresses, glitter T-shirts and two-piece lime green swimsuits for under $ 9.
Shein, which is regularly accused of copying designs, recently held a daylong summit in Los Angeles with hundreds of designers in an attempt to show that it wanted to work with and not against them. The event was part of a $ 55 million initiative that Shein began in 2021 to hire and fund artisans to make clothing lines for its site.
This program was started months after the designer Justin Romero, a co-founder of the fashion brand Freak City, in 2020 joined the chorus of designers calling out Shein for selling clothes that looked like copies of their products.
After some initial conversations with Shein's legal team, Mr. Romero talked directly with George Chiao, the president of Shein's U.S. business. Mr. Romero asked for data on how much Shein had sold of the clothing in question. It was eye-opening, he said.
"After seeing how many items they sold of our items already, it was like, we're already doing business without agreeing to," Mr. Romero said.
From there, Mr. Romero and Shein started a collaboration under a program that the company calls Shein X. Mr. Romero and his co-founder, Valerie Campbell, are participants.
Through Shein X, the company provides independent designers with a budget, pays their production costs and markets their wares on Shein's site. The designers receive either a sales commission or a share in the profits, an arrangement usually reserved for designers who have a licensing deal with a retailer. Its roughly 3,000 participants have collectively received $ 5 million in commissions, Mr. Chiao said at last month's summit in Los Angeles, where his remarks were met with cheers.
Shein is trying to win over a diverse group of designers, creating a pipeline of potential industry ambassadors. The retailer does not collect demographic information on its designers, but the team that runs the program has emphasized that Shein X artists and designers come from myriad backgrounds, according to a company spokeswoman.
"What they want to do is make more money, and they are now seeing that having a more diverse roster will generate them millions and billions of more gross margin profits," said Shawn Grain Carter, a professor of management at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "This is not an altruistic endeavor. This is a financial business endeavor."
During the daylong event in the heart of the city's downtown fashion district, Shein presented itself as an innovator with a profitable business model and a supporter of diversity and inclusion. It positioned itself at the nexus of pop culture and fashion by having panels with haute couture designers and health and beauty influencers. It capped off the day with a dance and musical performance. Shein's sustainability director pointed designers to recycled materials like polyester that the company was encouraging them to use.
"We've grown really, really fast as a business," Caitrin Watson, the sustainability director who was hired last April, said to the designers in the room. "But as you grow, people want to know more than just what product do you sell? They want to know who you are as a brand. What are your values? How are you making your clothes -- what are they made out of?"
That kind of message seemed devised, in part, to answer questions about how Shein conducts its business. Investors group Shein as a fast-fashion player; the company rejects that title, which evokes images of heaps of textiles dumped in landfills. Critics say its ultralow prices contribute to overconsumption and environmental waste; the retailer says it's focusing more on sustainable solutions.
And recently, Shein's connection to China has elicited concerns that the company exploits import laws. The company was founded in Nanjing, but it is now based in Singapore. Most of the factories that produce its clothing are in China.
Critics like the group Shut Down Shein, formed in March, say that Shein avoids U.S. Customs and Border Protection scrutiny and billions in tariffs by shipping directly to its customers under a certain price threshold. It doesn't record these shipments in bulk, the group says, like most other U.S. retailers.
Shut Down Shein also claims that the company commits human rights abuses. On Monday, two members of Congress wrote the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, asking that, as a condition of its expected offering, Shein be required to certify through an independent party that it doesn't use Uyghur forced labor.
The company said in a statement that it conducted business "lawfully and with full respect for the communities we serve."
The statement added, "As a global company with customers and operations around the world, Shein takes visibility across our entire supply chain seriously."
Attendees at the Los Angeles event didn't seem to dwell much on onlookers' wider concerns about Shein. When asked about accusations of copying, several designers said that creatives often looked to others in the field for inspiration. They seemed more interested in networking with Shein executives and fellow designers. They twirled in their latest designs and said they wanted to learn more about how they could use Shein's name to help elevate their own.
Designers in Shein X said that the retailer's massive audience had helped catapult their brand and that their sell-through rates were high. During happy hour, two participants jumped up and down after they realized that Shein had posted their photo and tagged it on Instagram, increasing their exposure to its 1.7 million followers.
"If you look at the amount of people who gravitate to the Shein brand, it's millions of folks, and the exciting part is even if you reach just a third of those people you're winning," said Kenya Freeman, whose line Sylvia Mollie has been sold on Shein since January 2021.
Shein still uses more than 250 in-house designers and third-party suppliers to design the clothes shoppers see on its website and mobile app. And on TikTok, independent designers still post videos accusing the company of ripping them off.
In 2020, Shein established a team in the United States to review potential intellectual property violations. Previously, those reviews were conducted in China. It also invested in image-recognition technology to recognize cases of potential infringement and required third-party suppliers to certify that their products don't infringe on others' intellectual property. A spokeswoman said there was a double-digit percentage decline in infringement claims from 2021 to 2022. She declined to share exact numbers.
Armand Mehidri, a 30-year-old Dubai-based designer in the Shein X program, said Shein used its data to help him sell more of his designs. After receiving a message from Shein alerting him that one of his shirts was selling well and suggesting he put the same design on hoodies and tank tops, he did just that, and they kept selling, he said.
While Shein X has given designers the opportunity to expand their businesses, working with the retailer still comes with baggage. After Casey Russell, 33, announced in 2022 on social media that he had been accepted into the program, he said that for two days he received "the traditional hate mail whenever you do something with a brand that's seen as bad." Critics flooded his Instagram comments and direct messages, calling him a sellout and claiming he was ruining the environment by making fast-fashion clothes.
Mr. Russell wasn't given a budget when he started his Shein line, a men's collection called Claude Russell that had 13 items go into production. In his first round, he said he made about $ 53,000 in sales. At the Los Angeles gathering, Shein gave him a booth to display some of his black and green capes and matching button-up shirts, which brought in about $ 5,000 in sales.
"When you work in the industry," Mr. Russell said, "you also realize that a lot of stuff that people talk about, it's actually not as bad as it looks on the outside."

During happy hour, two participants jumped up and down after they realized that Shein had posted their photo and tagged it on Instagram, increasing their exposure to its 1.7 million followers.
“If you look at the amount of people who gravitate to the Shein brand, it’s millions of folks, and the exciting part is even if you reach just a third of those people you’re winning,” said Kenya Freeman, whose line Sylvia Mollie has been sold on Shein since January 2021.
Shein still uses more than 250 in-house designers and third-party suppliers to design the clothes shoppers see on its website and mobile app. And on TikTok, independent designers still post videos accusing the company of ripping them off.
In 2020, Shein established a team in the United States to review potential intellectual property violations. Previously, those reviews were conducted in China. It also invested in image-recognition technology to recognize cases of potential infringement and required third-party suppliers to certify that their products don’t infringe on others’ intellectual property. A spokesperson said there was a double-digit percentage decline in infringement claims from 2021 to 2022. She declined to share exact numbers.
Armand Mehidri, a 30-year-old Dubai, United Arab Emirates-based designer in the Shein X program, said Shein used its data to help him sell more of his designs. After receiving a message from Shein alerting him that one of his shirts was selling well and suggesting he put the same design on hoodies and tank tops, he did just that, and they kept selling, he said.
While Shein X has given designers the opportunity to expand their businesses, working with the retailer still comes with baggage. After Casey Russell, 33, announced in 2022 on social media that he had been accepted into the program, he said that for two days he received “the traditional hate mail whenever you do something with a brand that’s seen as bad.” Critics flooded his Instagram comments and direct messages, calling him a sellout and claiming he was ruining the environment by making fast-fashion clothes.
Russell wasn’t given a budget when he started his Shein line, a men’s collection called Claude Russell that had 13 items go into production. In his first round, he said he made about $53,000 in sales. At the Los Angeles gathering, Shein gave him a booth to display some of his black and green capes and matching button-up shirts, which brought in about $5,000 in sales.
“When you work in the industry,” Russell said, “you also realize that a lot of stuff that people talk about, it’s actually not as bad as it looks on the outside.”

Full text: As more states legalize marijuana and competition for talent grows fiercer, the U.S. government is loosening guidelines from the "Just Say No" era.
Not long ago, urinating in a cup for a drug test was a widely accepted, if annoying, requirement to start a new job. The legalization of marijuana in more and more states in recent years upended that, prompting many employers to shelve hiring rules from the "Just Say No" era.
There was a major holdout: the federal government, by far the nation's largest employer. But now, it too is significantly relaxing drug screening rules as agencies struggle to replenish the ranks of a rapidly aging work force in a tight job market.
During the past five years, the United States military gave more than 3,400 new recruits who failed a drug test on their first day a grace period to try again, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Agencies like the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. have adopted more lenient rules regarding past use of marijuana among job candidates, officials acknowledge.
And later this year, the Biden administration is expected to take another major step, scaling back how deeply the government delves into the drug histories of people applying for a security clearance.
Polls show that more than half of Americans have used marijuana recreationally or medicinally and that a majority believe it should be legal. Medical cannabis use is legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Recreational marijuana is lawful in 22 states as well as the nation's capital but remains illegal under federal law.
"We don't want to be disqualifying half of the population, tens of millions of people, for having done something that most of our recent presidents have done," said Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who has introduced legislation that would deem marijuana use immaterial in security clearance reviews required for many federal jobs. "You're taking huge numbers of people off the field."
Once hired, federal employees remain barred from using drugs including marijuana, even in states that have legalized it. And while there is broad support for more permissive hiring policies regarding past marijuana use, the shifting rules have critics.
When Gen. David H. Berger became the commandant of the Marine Corps in 2019, he expressed concern about how prevalent drug use had become among Marines.
"I remain troubled by the extent to which drug abuse is a characteristic of new recruits, and the fact the vast majority of recruits require drug waivers for enlistment," he wrote in a report on the state of the Marine Corps. The Marines declined to provide specific data on drug waivers for enlistment.
Until recently, admitting recent drug use was disqualifying for many roles. But even some of the government's most selective agencies have loosened their rules as part of a patchwork of policies that have gone largely unnoticed outside of the federal government.
The C.I.A., for instance, began telling applicants in April of 2022 that they needed to refrain from using marijuana for just 90 days before submitting an application, shortening its previous one-year eligibility requirement. In 2021, the F.B.I. reduced its marijuana abstention requirement for those seeking employment to one year from three.
In December 2021, Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, issued a memo stating that past recreational marijuana use ought to be regarded as "relevant," but "not determinative," in deciding a person's suitability for sensitive national security work.
And late last year, at the urging of senior national security officials, the Office of Personnel Management put forward a proposed overhaul of the security clearance vetting process that would effectively stop regarding people who previously used marijuana as a security risk.
Currently, people applying for a security clearance must disclose a detailed account of their use of illegal drugs during the past seven years. Background checks to issue security clearances explore whether an applicant has been truthful about drug use.
Under the proposed new rules, the government would limit that time frame to five years for drugs other than marijuana, and applicants would be asked to disclose marijuana use only during the 90 days before they sought the job.
The recent arrest of a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of leaking classified documents has renewed debate in Congress about how the government protects its secrets. But officials said that case had not affected the proposed overhaul of the security clearance screening process regarding drug use histories.
A senior intelligence official involved in personnel policies said the government is struggling to recruit people in their 20s as the unemployment rate is among the lowest it has been in half a century. The official, who declined to be quoted by name because the proposed changes in the government rules remain under review, said it had become clear that the intelligence community needed to adjust to a changing landscape as its employees grow older.
The government competes for talent with the private sector, which often offers better salaries, more opportunities for remote work and, increasingly, a laissez-faire approach to drug use that doesn't affect job performance.
Military recruiters ask prospective service members about their alcohol and drug use and are instructed to disqualify those with substance abuse problems -- current or past. A key hurdle comes when recruits take a drug test at a military entrance processing station as they officially join. For years, failing that test usually meant getting kicked out on Day 1.
In 2022, 4,710 recruits failed their entry drug tests, a nearly 33 percent increase from 2020, according to military data.
Between 2018 and 2022, the Army granted waivers to more than 3,300 recruits who failed a drug test or admitted past drug use that technically made them ineligible, according to Army data. The Army has historically been more lenient with waivers than the other services.
The Navy, which had a zero-tolerance policy for those who failed an entry drug test, launched a pilot program in 2021 that allowed recruits the chance to take a second test after 90 days. Over the past three years, the Navy said it has issued drug waivers to 1,375 recruits.
"We recognize that changes in state laws concerning marijuana around the country mean that a portion of our target demographic of 17- to 24-year-olds are more likely to have used THC," Cmdr. Dave Benham, a Navy spokesman, said, referring to the active ingredient in marijuana.
The Marine Corps and Air Force also recently began allowing recruits a second opportunity to take drug tests. Military officials said the policies should not be construed as a more permissive stance on drug use once people are in the service. Federal workers are subject to random drug tests and individual agencies have significant leeway in how often they require them.
"Simply because we have a waiver process, we're not lowering our qualifications," said Master Sgt. Brandon S. Reid of the Air Force, who oversees a team of recruiters in New York City.
Sergeant Reid's team recently allowed a highly qualified recruit who had signed up for a hard-to-fill mechanic role to take a second test after he failed a first one. The recruit told Air Force officials that he had been in an unventilated basement with a friend who was smoking marijuana, an account that was deemed credible, Sergeant Reid said, and the recruit passed the second test.
"It ended up being a win-win for the Air Force because we got a high-quality recruit who was motivated and honest throughout the process," he said. Since 2018, the vast majority of military recruits allowed to retake a drug test passed a second one, according to data from the military.
Beth J. Asch, an economist at the RAND Corporation, which conducts research for the Defense Department, said there was a common assumption that service members who enter the military after obtaining waivers are subpar recruits. But a 2021 study she led looking at the career outcomes of all soldiers who received waivers between 2001 and 2012 showed that those with a history of drug use performed no worse than their peers.
"Leaders in the military are well aware that legalization is happening and attitudes have become more tolerant," Dr. Asch said. "My sense is they will try to take leniency to the extent they can while still being consistent with federal law."
The government's focus on drug use in the federal work force began during the Vietnam War amid concerns that heroin and marijuana use had become endemic among service members. A Pentagon health survey in 1980 showed that more than 27 percent of service members disclosed having used illegal drugs within the previous 30 days.
In the years that followed, President Ronald Reagan escalated the war against drugs that had been launched in the Nixon administration. A centerpiece was the "Just Say No" campaign, led by the first lady, Nancy Reagan.
Banning drug use in the federal work force was a key initiative.
"Federal employees who use illegal drugs, on or off duty, tend to be less productive, less reliable and prone to greater absenteeism than their fellow employees who do not use illegal drugs," Mr. Reagan wrote in a 1986 executive order that formally prohibited federal workers from using drugs.
The private sector followed the government's lead. By 1990, nearly 46 percent of workplaces with more than 250 employees were drug testing workers, up from just under 32 percent in 1988, according to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Three decades on, the course has shifted: By 2021, only 16 percent of private sector employers were testing workers for narcotics or alcohol, a federal report showed.
Large employers that have phased out drug testing include Apple and Amazon, which in 2021 said it made the decision based on national data showing "that pre-employment marijuana testing disproportionately impacts people of color and acts as a barrier to employment." (The New York Times stopped requiring drug tests as a condition for employment for many jobs more than five years ago.)
Gary Hess, a former Marine officer from Louisiana, said that for most of his career, he felt drug use ought to be disqualifying for workers. His disdain for drug users was such that he fired a brother from a private sector job in 2010 for using cannabis.
But a few years later, struggling with service-related chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder, Mr. Hess said he turned to medicinal cannabis as a "last resort."
"For me it became a performance enhancer," said Mr. Hess, who founded the Veterans Alliance for Holistic Alternatives, which provides veterans with information about treatments including cannabis and psychedelics.
Mr. Hess said discussions about drug use in the national security field continued to overstate the dangers and overlook the therapeutic potential of some of these substances.
"They could achieve an incredible amount of resiliency in their work force if they educated their communities about medical cannabis," he said.

Hollywood Is Bracing For a Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the 16 years since the entertainment industry's last strike, sweeping technological change has upended the television and movie business.
When the most recent Hollywood strike took place -- 16 years ago -- the internet had not yet transformed the television and movie businesses. Broadcast networks still commanded colossal audiences, and cable channels were still growing. The superhero boom had begun for movie studios, and DVDs generated $ 16 billion in annual sales.
Since then, galloping technological change has upended Hollywood in ways that few could have imagined. Traditional television is on viewership life support. Movie studios, stung by poor ticket sales for dramas and comedies, have retreated almost entirely to franchise spectacles. The DVD business is over; Netflix will ship its last little silver discs on Sept. 29.
It's a streaming world now. The pandemic sped up the shift.
What has not changed much? The formulas that studios use to pay television and movie creators, setting the stage for another strike. "Writer compensation needs to evolve for a streaming-first world," said Rich Greenfield, a founder of the LightShed Partners research firm.
Absent an unlikely last-minute resolution with studios, more than 11,000 unionized screenwriters could head to picket lines in Los Angeles and New York as soon as Tuesday, an action that, depending on its duration, would bring Hollywood's creative assembly lines to a gradual halt. Writers Guild of America leaders have called this an "existential" moment, contending that compensation has stagnated despite the proliferation of content in the streaming era -- to the degree that even writers with substantial experience are having a hard time getting ahead and, sometimes, paying their bills.
"Writers at every level and in every genre, whether it's features or TV, we're all being devalued and financially taken advantage of by the studios," said Danny Tolli, a writer whose credits include "Roswell, New Mexico" and the Shondaland show "The Catch."
"These studios are making billions in profits, and they are spending billions on content -- content that we create with our blood, sweat and tears," Mr. Tolli continued. "But there are times when I still have to worry about how I'm going to pay my mortgage. How I'm going to provide for my family. I have considered Uber to supplement my income."
Studio chiefs have largely maintained public silence, leaving communication to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on their behalf. In statements, the organization has said its goal was a "mutually beneficial deal," which was "only possible if the guild is committed to turning its focus to serious bargaining" and "searching for reasonable compromises."
Privately, numerous studio and streaming service executives portrayed writers as histrionic and out of touch. You can't make a living as a TV writer? By what standard? The business has changed; get used to it.
By some measures, a major strike in Hollywood is long overdue. Since the 1940s, with a couple of exceptions, strikes have shaken the entertainment industry almost like clockwork -- every seven or eight years -- usually aligning with upheaval in the fast-changing business. The dawn of television. The rise of cable networks.
"These things gotta happen every five years or so, 10 years," Clemenza, the weathered Corleone capo, explains in "The Godfather," one of Hollywood's most storied creations, as the film's gangster families "go to the mattresses" against one another. "Helps to get rid of the bad blood."
For generations, ever since the end of the silent film era, Hollywood writers have complained that studios treat them as second-class citizens -- that their artistic contributions are underappreciated (and undercompensated), especially compared with those of actors and directors.
Among Hollywood workers, screenwriters have walked out the most often (six times) and were responsible for the entertainment industry's most recent strike in 2007. It was a precarious economic time -- the Great Recession was underway -- but "new media" was on the horizon. Apple had started to sell iPods that could play video. Disney was offering $ 2 downloads for episodes of "Lost." Hulu was in the start-up stages.
The existing contract between studios and the Writers Guild of America, which expires at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time on Tuesday, sets minimum weekly pay for certain television writer-producers at $ 7,412. (Agents for experienced writers can negotiate that up.) One problem, according to the guild, involves the number of weeks writers work in the streaming era.
Because of streaming, the network norms of 22, 24 or even 26 episodes per season have mostly disappeared. Most streaming series are eight to 12 episodes long. As a result, the median writer-producer works nearly 40 weeks on a network show, according to guild data, but only 24 weeks on a streaming show, making it difficult to earn a stable paycheck.
Residuals have also been undercut by streaming. Before streaming, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was resold -- into syndication, for overseas airing, on DVD. But global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have cut off those distribution arms.
Instead, streaming services pay a fixed residual. Writers say there is no way to know whether those fees are fair because services hide viewership data. A new contract, guild leaders have said, must include a formula for paying residuals based on views.
Guild leaders contend that it would cost studios a collective $ 600 million a year to give them everything they want. The companies, however, are under pressure from Wall Street to cut costs. And gains for one group of entertainment workers would almost certainly need to be extended to others: Contracts with the Directors Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, expire on June 30.
Hollywood companies say they simply cannot afford widespread raises. Loaded with $ 45 billion in debt, Disney laid off thousands of employees in recent days, part of a campaign to eliminate 7,000 jobs by the end of June. Disney+ remains unprofitable, although the company has vowed to change that by next year. Disney is Hollywood's largest supplier of union-covered TV dramas and comedies (890 episodes for the 2021-22 season).
Warner Bros. Discovery, which has roughly $ 47 billion in debt, has already cut thousands of jobs as part of a $ 4 billion pullback. NBCUniversal is also tightening its belt as it contends with cable cord-cutting and a troublesome advertising market.
These companies remain highly profitable. But they have not been delivering the kind of steady profit growth that Wall Street rewards.
Screenwriters come into these talks with notable swagger. In 2019, when film and TV writers fired their agents in a campaign over what they saw as conflicts of interest, many agency leaders figured that the guild would eventually fracture. That never happened: After a 22-month standoff, the big agencies effectively gave writers what they wanted.
For screenwriters, there is also pent-up demand for raises, made worse by climbing inflation. When writers last had the opportunity to negotiate a contract, the pandemic was shutting down Hollywood, and so the two sides came to a speedy agreement -- "essentially kicking the can down the road" in the words of Mr. Greenfield. In the negotiation cycle before that, writers focused more on shoring up their generous health plan.
And writers have been incensed by mixed messaging from companies on their financial health.
"NBCUniversal is performing extremely well operationally and financially," Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, wrote to employees last week, when the division's top executive was ousted.
Netflix's co-chief executive, Ted Sarandos, received a pay package worth $ 50.3 million in 2022, up 32 percent from 2021, Netflix disclosed last week.
"Lots of people are still getting very rich off of Hollywood product -- just not the creators of that product," said Matt Ember, a screenwriter whose credits include "Get Smart," "The War With Grandpa" and the animated "Home."
The upshot: The situation might get worse before it gets better.
"Every industry goes through course corrections," said Laura Lewis, the founder of Rebelle Media, an entertainment production and financing company. "Maybe this is an opportunity to adjust the models for the next phase of the entertainment business."
"The question," she continued, "is how much pain will we have to endure to get there."

Needing Younger Workers, Federal Officials Relax Rules on Past Drug Use

There was a major holdout: the federal government, by far the nation’s largest employer. But now, it too is significantly relaxing drug screening rules as agencies struggle to replenish the ranks of a rapidly aging workforce in a tight job market.
During the past five years, the U.S. military gave more than 3,400 new recruits who failed a drug test on their first day a grace period to try again, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

The government competes for talent with the private sector, which often offers better salaries, more opportunities for remote work and, increasingly, a laissez-faire approach to drug use that doesn’t affect job performance.
Military recruiters ask prospective service members about their alcohol and drug use and are instructed to disqualify those with substance abuse problems — current or past. A key hurdle comes when recruits take a drug test at a military entrance processing station as they officially join. For years, failing that test usually meant getting kicked out on Day 1.
In 2022, 4,710 recruits failed their entry drug tests, a nearly 33% increase from 2020, according to military data.
Between 2018 and 2022, the Army granted waivers to more than 3,300 recruits who failed a drug test or admitted past drug use that technically made them ineligible, according to Army data. The Army has historically been more lenient with waivers than the other services.
The Navy, which had a zero-tolerance policy for those who failed an entry drug test, launched a pilot program in 2021 that allowed recruits the chance to take a second test after 90 days. Over the past three years, the Navy said it has issued drug waivers to 1,375 recruits.
“We recognize that changes in state laws concerning marijuana around the country mean that a portion of our target demographic of 17- to 24-year-olds are more likely to have used THC,” Cmdr. Dave Benham, a Navy spokesperson, said, referring to the active ingredient in marijuana.
The Marine Corps and Air Force also recently began allowing recruits a second opportunity to take drug tests. Military officials said the policies should not be construed as a more permissive stance on drug use once people are in the service. Federal workers are subject to random drug tests, and individual agencies have significant leeway in how often they require them.
“Simply because we have a waiver process, we’re not lowering our qualifications,” said Master Sgt. Brandon S. Reid of the Air Force, who oversees a team of recruiters in New York City.
Reid’s team recently allowed a highly qualified recruit who had signed up for a hard-to-fill mechanic role to take a second test after he failed a first one. The recruit told Air Force officials that he had been in an unventilated basement with a friend who was smoking marijuana, an account that was deemed credible, Reid said, and the recruit passed the second test.
“It ended up being a win-win for the Air Force because we got a high-quality recruit who was motivated and honest throughout the process,” he said.
Since 2018, the vast majority of military recruits allowed to retake a drug test passed a second one, according to data from the military.
Beth J. Asch, an economist at the RAND Corp., which conducts research for the Defense Department, said there was a common assumption that service members who enter the military after obtaining waivers are subpar recruits. But a 2021 study she led looking at the career outcomes of all soldiers who received waivers between 2001 and 2012 showed that those with a history of drug use performed no worse than their peers.
“Leaders in the military are well aware that legalization is happening and attitudes have become more tolerant,” Asch said. “My sense is they will try to take leniency to the extent they can while still being consistent with federal law.”
The government’s focus on drug use in the federal workforce began during the Vietnam War amid concerns that heroin and marijuana use had become endemic among service members. A Pentagon health survey in 1980 showed that more than 27% of service members disclosed having used illegal drugs within the previous 30 days.
In the years that followed, President Ronald Reagan escalated the war against drugs that had been launched in the Nixon administration. A centerpiece was the “Just Say No” campaign, led by first lady Nancy Reagan.
Banning drug use in the federal workforce was a key initiative.
“Federal employees who use illegal drugs, on or off duty, tend to be less productive, less reliable and prone to greater absenteeism than their fellow employees who do not use illegal drugs,” Reagan wrote in a 1986 executive order that formally prohibited federal workers from using drugs.
The private sector followed the government’s lead. By 1990, nearly 46% of workplaces with more than 250 employees were drug testing workers, up from just under 32% in 1988, according to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Three decades on, the course has shifted: By 2021, only 16% of private sector employers were testing workers for narcotics or alcohol, a federal report showed.
Large employers that have phased out drug testing include Apple and Amazon, which in 2021 said it made the decision based on national data showing “that preemployment marijuana testing disproportionately impacts people of color and acts as a barrier to employment.” (The New York Times stopped requiring drug tests as a condition for employment for many jobs more than five years ago.)
Gary Hess, a former Marine officer from Louisiana, said that for most of his career, he felt drug use ought to be disqualifying for workers. His disdain for drug users was such that he fired a brother from a private sector job in 2010 for using cannabis.
But a few years later, struggling with service-related chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder, Hess said he turned to medicinal cannabis as a “last resort.”
“For me it became a performance enhancer,” said Hess, who founded the Veterans Alliance for Holistic Alternatives, which provides veterans with information about treatments including cannabis and psychedelics.
Hess said discussions about drug use in the national security field continued to overstate the dangers and overlook the therapeutic potential of some of these substances.
“They could achieve an incredible amount of resiliency in their workforce if they educated their communities about medical cannabis,” he said.

Fast Money and Faded Hope in China's Shopping Craze: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The yurt stood in the middle of a sweeping northern Chinese grassland, beneath a cloudless sky. A reedy folk tune played. Nearby, sheep grazed.
Suddenly the livestream, which had been showing the idyllic vista, cut to a man in his 30s, wearing a Mongolian hat with a pointed golden spire. "Welcome, brothers and sisters!" he announced from his perch atop a platform bed. "How's the signal? I set up Wi-Fi in my yurt." He held up a bag of beef jerky, branded with a cartoon image of his face. "If it's your first time here, I'm Taiping, and I make beef jerky."
It was another day at work for Taiping, a Chinese livestreaming salesman. Illuminated by carefully arranged studio lights, speaking into two iPhones propped up on a table, Taiping began wooing the thousands of viewers who tapped into his channel. He dangled unwrapped jerky before the camera, describing traditional Mongolian air-drying techniques. He shredded it with his fingers to show its tenderness.
Viewers, by typing comments, sent real-time questions that bubbled from the bottom of the video feed, about how spicy it was or which flavor was best. (Taiping, who read each comment aloud, suggested buying half original, half cumin.) Some longtime fans sent animated pink hearts or thumbs-up symbols, while others simply wanted to say hello. "I missed you, too," Taiping, who like many ethnic Mongolians uses only one name, replied to one viewer.
By the end of the four-hour session, during which he barely paused to drink water, he had received more than 650 orders, totaling $ 15,000.
Taiping is one of countless Chinese riding the explosive wave of influencer culture and live online videos in the country to transform the way people buy and sell. Last year alone, an estimated $ 500 billion in goods were sold via livestream on apps like Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, or Kuaishou, another short video platform -- an eightfold increase since 2019.
Star streamers have become celebrities. The most famous, including Li Jiaqi -- whose prowess at trying on and pitching makeup products earned him the nickname "lipstick king" -- are able to attract tens of millions of viewers per session. Kim Kardashian once appeared with another top Chinese streamer, Viya, to promote her perfume in China, selling 15,000 bottles within minutes.
The format emerged in China several years ago, then became ubiquitous during the coronavirus pandemic. Now nearly half of China's one billion internet users have tried it, even as it remains largely unfamiliar in the West. To Americans, it may be reminiscent of television shopping -- but interactive and, as a result, far more compelling.
The most successful streams are as much entertainment as they are sales pitches. Hosts hawk everything from makeup to microwaves, in an energetic patter that marries the urgency of an auctioneer with the intimacy of an old friend. They tell jokes and personal anecdotes to hold viewers' attention. They call individual fans by name to earn their trust. They promise exclusive deals to win their dollars.
For viewers, the appeal is not only convenience, but also the feeling of being catered to. They can ask a host modeling clothing to show it from a different angle, or inquire how long a snack will keep. They place orders in the stream, never interrupting their favorite host's spiel.
Restaurants, beauty salons, and even car dealerships and property developers now court customers in real time. Global brands from Ikea to Louis Vuitton have paid China's influencers to stream their products. But much of the appeal of this line of business is that anyone can do it: Farmers, factory workers and retirees have joined the frenzy.
Taiping, a former herdsman, now runs his own jerky factory and has more than one million followers. He recently starred in a Kuaishou ad campaign splashed across subway stations in Beijing.
Yet with the market's breakneck growth has come new challenges. Fierce competition has driven many streamers away. A broader economic slowdown has fueled layoffs at the companies behind the streaming platforms.
And the Chinese government, worried that the business was growing too big, too fast, has issued a flood of ever-evolving regulations. Celebrity hosts have abruptly disappeared from view.
The story of livestreaming e-commerce, then, is not only about the rise of a new form of shopping. It is a window into the opportunities and perils of doing business in today's China, as Beijing seeks greater control of private enterprise.
"The Chinese state is so caught up in this economy; it has a dual goal of boosting development, which is a huge imperative for them, and maintaining stability," said Lin Zhang, a media studies professor at the University of New Hampshire who has studied Chinese e-commerce. "Sometimes, this tension is impossible for them to resolve."
A High-Tech New Opportunity
Growing up, Taiping could hardly have imagined making a fortune by any means, let alone by talking into his phone. Born in the plains of Inner Mongolia, a region in northern China where temperatures can plummet to minus 20 degrees, he left school after fifth grade, working as a herdsman, security guard and truck driver. He hardly spoke Mandarin, China's dominant language, as his schoolteachers had taught mostly in Mongolian.
In 2015, noticing that his town's scenic grasslands were attracting tourists, Taiping, then 30 years old, decided to borrow $ 15,000 to make and sell his own beef jerky. But weeks later, the tourist season ended.
Then a friend introduced him to Kuaishou.
The app, pronounced kwai-show, started as China's first short video platform, a place where users shared clips of themselves dancing, cooking or harvesting crops. Taiping quickly saw business potential: He began posting prerecorded videos about his jerky, shipping it to people who messaged him to buy.
Soon, a different opportunity arose. Kuaishou itself had also been looking for ways to make money, and around the time Taiping joined, it introduced livestreaming. At first, streamers earned money purely by performing, trying to attract fans who could send virtual tips; the platform took a cut. But before long, some streamers began staging outlandish stunts to lure viewers, like eating light bulbs, or discussing topics considered taboo, like teenage pregnancy.
Chinese officials, alarmed by what they called "vulgar" content, ordered the company to clean up. Kuaishou scrambled for a new direction -- and, in 2018, landed on live sales. By encouraging streamers to sell products, it could still capitalize on the popularity of livestreaming, but in a more predictable context.
One day, Taiping received a phone call from a Kuaishou representative, who said the company was looking to support rural entrepreneurs. It wanted to help Taiping expand through livestreaming.
Taiping hesitated. "My Mandarin wasn't good," he recalled. "I was nervous. I didn't know how to interact with people."
But the company offered to fly him to Beijing for training; he had never been on a plane, so he agreed. He received a crash course in public speaking, employee management and trademark registration. Kuaishou, eager to advertise its wholesome new direction, promoted his journey in the media.
Over time, Taiping -- who at first had kept a Mandarin dictionary just offscreen -- became confident and unflappable. He heartily gnawed his jerky on camera. He invited fans, whom he called "old friends," to visit, promising a personal grasslands tour. When he occasionally still stumbled over a word, he poked fun at his limited education.
In 2018, he sold $ 650,000 worth of jerky -- earning 30 times more that year than two years earlier.
Then the pandemic hit, turbocharging online shopping. The value of Kuaishou's e-commerce sales grew six times in 2020 over the prior year, according to company statistics, mirroring booms at Douyin and Taobao Live, the other major live shopping platform. In 2021, Kuaishou went public for $ 5.4 billion, the world's biggest technology initial public offering since Uber.
Taiping's business soared, too. He now has 10 customer-service employees who help him respond to fans while he talks. He still sometimes streams from his grassland yurt but also had a yurt backdrop built above his brick-and-mortar store. Onscreen, he wears traditional clothing -- customers like the feeling of authenticity, he said -- but off duty, favors Fila athletic suits.
"Before, how would I know what a trademark was?" he said. "Now I have three."
Chasing an Elusive Dream
More than 1,000 miles south of Taiping's grassland empire, the city of Yiwu is a living showcase for how pervasive livestreaming sales have become.
The city, a manufacturing hub south of Shanghai, claims China's first college for livestreaming e-commerce, as well as multiple training academies that offer days- or weeklong courses. Its office towers house dozens of companies dedicated to managing streamers. The city government, to woo high-earning influencers, has promised prime school placement for their children. Officials built a red archway above a street, trumpeting in neon letters: "Social Media and E-Commerce Capital."‌
Every day, Yiwu draws aspiring streamers like Wang Tiebiao, 55, who is from a small city in eastern Shandong Province about 700 miles away. Mr. Wang had been delivering cargo and selling cheap stainless steel cookware, barely covering inventory costs. Then he saw a Douyin video recruiting streamers to sell home goods for a factory in Yiwu, and promising free training.
"If you open a physical business, you have to pay rent, buy goods, invest so much," Mr. Wang said in February, days after getting to the city. "For this, you just need yourself and a phone."
But the rapid expansion of the field, which has created more opportunities for anybody to jump in, has also made it more difficult to hang on. If Taiping embodied livestreaming's potential for riches, Yiwu is closer to most people's reality.
Under Mr. Wang's deal with the factory, he could choose any of its goods to promote on his personal Douyin account. He would receive a commission on any sales. He had no income otherwise.
To make a sale, however, he had to stand out against legions of other streamers -- not only the fellow newbies working for the same factory, but also the smooth-talking veterans trained and backed by production companies. From his free training, he learned only a few catchphrases and basic technical skills.
For several days, Mr. Wang wandered around the factory's showroom, assessing what among the rows of plastic bowls and spatulas he could pitch well. One morning, fixing his camera on a decorative hourglass shaped like interlocking gemstones, he tested the techniques he had learned for sweet-talking viewers.
"Fans are the heavens and earth, so hit that follow button," he said. His glasses and measured delivery gave him a soothing, professorial air, and he avoided extended silences. Still, his viewers stayed in the single digits.
"There's some metaphysics, or luck, or secrets that we don't know," Mr. Wang said.
Some secrets may be just a matter of money. Many streamers now complain that the apps promote only accounts that pay for traffic. Big agencies splurge on advertising.
Within days of arriving in Yiwu, several of Mr. Wang's fellow trainees had pivoted to looking for more traditional work. Still, Mr. Wang, who had amassed about 1,000 followers, planned to keep trying.
"If I were just another cog in a factory, I could make a few thousand dollars, but I don't want that," he said. "Since we all have to work anyway, I'd rather work for something that has a chance of success."
The State Tries to Clean Up -- And Control
But that success can vanish as quickly as it appears.
First to disappear was Viya, whose real name is Huang Wei, the livestreaming star who had broadcast with Ms. Kardashian. One day in December 2021, all of her social media accounts were deleted.
Several months later, Li Jiaqi, the lipstick king, was abruptly cut off midstream. He posted on social media that he was fixing a technical glitch -- then went silent.
Both had run afoul of the other major force reshaping the livestreaming market: government scrutiny.
Growth was so quick that at first few rules existed to govern it, and soon complaints of misconduct piled up. Brands accused influencers of faking viewership numbers to demand higher commissions. Shoppers reported receiving counterfeit goods from streamers who had seemed trustworthy. Beijing had little way of knowing just how much streamers were earning.
And as audiences grew, so did the potential for livestreams to promote ideas beyond what to buy -- in a format that was, by definition, unpredictable, posing political concerns for a government fixated on control.
Starting in late 2020, regulators began playing catch-up, issuing increasingly detailed restrictions on what streamers could say and do -- part of a broader crackdown on the tech sector, which Beijing believed had grown too influential.
Many of the regulations aim to protect consumers. Unproven claims that products can promote weight loss or improve feng shui are forbidden. Platforms often ban the use of superlatives, like "cheapest" or "best." The rules are enforced through a mix of human censors and artificial intelligence; penalties range from 10-minute suspensions to permanent bans.
Viya's offense was evading more than $ 100 million in taxes, according to the authorities. They fined her $ 210 million, then apparently erased her from the internet. More than a year later, she has not resurfaced.
But the government also wants live-streamers to abide by its moral and political standards. Platforms have banned smoking and low necklines. A state-issued code of conduct, issued in June, ordered hosts not to disparage the Chinese Communist Party, and to "establish a correct world outlook."
"To be a live-streamer, you must have reverence," a commentary in People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, said. "You absolutely must not cross the bottom line for the sake of traffic, or test the law for the sake of money."
As the rules proliferated, they risked eroding the central appeal of live-streamed shopping: the entertaining, carnivalesque atmosphere. Mr. Li, the star streamer, had drawn an ardent following with his sassy, at-times off-color jokes, poking fun at other celebrities. But as regulations emerged, he said, he restrained his style. In an interview with a Chinese news outlet in 2021, he acknowledged that some fans thought he had become boring; sometimes, he said, he agreed.
But Mr. Li could not avoid all risks. In the livestream last year where he was cut off midstream, he pitched his viewers on a tank-shaped ice cream cake -- one day before the anniversary of the Chinese military's June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators. There is no indication that Mr. Li intended to deliver a politically charged message. The topic is heavily censored in China and many younger people do not know about it. Still, he vanished for three months.
The constantly evolving landscape has also weighed on smaller-time streamers, like Taiping.
Viewers frequently ask him to speak in Mongolian, and he used to readily comply. But then the streaming platforms started issuing automated warnings for speaking in languages other than Mandarin. (The government has made Mandarin usage a key part of assimilationist policies; other languages may also be harder for censors to understand.)
Taiping now at most says hello in Mongolian. "I won't talk at random," he said. "I've seen what happened to others, and I warn myself."
In recent months, the pace of new regulations has slowed, as the government has pledged to rejuvenate the economy, including by supporting tech companies. Government reports have called livestreaming e-commerce an important channel for boosting consumption.
Tech companies still see room for expansion. Douyin last year reported 124 percent annual growth in livestreaming sales.
In the United States, YouTube and Amazon have poured money into it. But it has struggled to catch on. Americans have returned to in-person shopping after the pandemic, and unlike in China, Western social media apps don't have as many built-in payment features. Facebook and Instagram recently abandoned live shopping.
Even in China, the future of the business is far from certain.
Taiping, despite his success, doesn't see himself streaming forever. Spending hours every day performing for the camera is exhausting; once the stream turns off, he often doesn't want to talk.
He dreams of moving to a big city, becoming a more traditional businessman.
Once, he imagined passing his account to his preteen daughter, but no longer. "By then, who knows if e-commerce will still be around?" he said. "There will probably be something new."

Full text: Harrison Ball is retiring. After battling addiction, he is engaged to Zac Posen, serious about acting and grateful for his career.
Harrison Ball, a principal at New York City Ballet, has tears in his toes. His sesamoid bone is crushed and, he said, dying. There is bone shard sticking into a tendon in his foot. His arthritis is so bad that his doctor told him it was comparable to that of an elderly person. He can't do his job if he can't pirouette.
So on Sunday, he's leaving his job. He's barely 30.
Such an early farewell is not the norm. But for Ball, who was promoted to the rank of principal dancer just last year, the injuries were too much. "It's gotten to the point where I just can't do my job without being in an enormous amount of pain," he said.
Even with that pain, Ball has been performing in new, intriguing ways. As the Poet in "La Sonnambula" and Puck in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," both George Balanchine ballets, his seriousness, his investment as a dramatic dancer brought a new urgency to the characters. "I could just see his future right in front of me lining up," said Wendy Whelan, City Ballet's associate artistic director.
Whelan is trying to look at the bigger picture in terms of Ball and others who have parted ways with the company since the pandemic started. There have been more than a few and from all ranks, including Jonathan Fahoury, Claire Kretzschmar and Lauren Lovette. "Everybody knows leaving is scary," she said. "Artists, young people are a little more courageous a little sooner."
Whelan and Jonathan Stafford, the company's artistic director, had been excited to promote Ball. "He's such a technician and this classicist and also contemporary and free -- he's an investigator, you know?" Whelan said. "You always love when you have a dancer like that at your fingertips to guide and help. He could morph."
Ball is looking more toward acting in his future. He just got a part on the ballet-world series "Étoile," coming to Amazon, by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino of "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" and "Bunheads." He's also focused on choreography: His "Purcell Suite," a work for New Jersey Ballet, will be performed at Kaatsbaan Cultural Park in June. And his personal life has come together, too. He is engaged to the fashion designer Zac Posen, whom he met at City Ballet and became close with during the pandemic.
Ball, disarming and funny, has a spontaneous streak. Much of his life has been erratic and wild, fueled, in part, by drug and alcohol addiction. (He was partial to cocaine, he said; he's been sober for more than five years.) Even Ball's childhood was unorthodox. He started ballet training at 4 with the now-defunct Charleston Ballet Theater in South Carolina and performed as a child. "I was this little kid, and I was touring with all these adults," he said. "During the day, the dancers would take me with them during the lunch break. They would all go to a bar."
When he was about 15, while a student at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, he lost his dorm privileges as a result of disciplinary action; with his family's support, he lived on his own in an apartment, he said, with his mother checking in on him periodically from South Carolina, where she and her husband were raising two other sons. Soon, he was fully on his own. "It was a really weird situation," Vera Ball, his mother, said, "but, yeah, that's what we had to do."
She added, "I just wanted him to be able to be him, and this was where it was."
He was enrolled at the Professional Children's School, which specializes in educating young artists, athletes and others, but stopped going. As a ballet student and as a member of City Ballet, which he joined in 2012, he was something of a party animal. He had a steady paycheck but was always short on cash.
When he was 24, he broke both of his feet in a rehearsal. He wasn't even dancing when it happened. "I was talking, and I took a step on my right foot, and it went" -- Ball clicked his tongue to make a popping sound -- "and then I took a step on my left foot" -- he clicked again -- "and I just fell." Instead of crying, he laughed. Surely, this was a sign. "I had a really rampant alcohol problem at that time," he said. "I was using a lot of drugs. I was homeless for a while. I was living in a car."
He slept and showered at the theater, he said. The address on his driver's license still reads 20 Lincoln Center Plaza. "It was a really wild moment for me," he said. "And the hardest part of it was keeping up the facade, right? Because nobody really knew."
The only person at the company he had told about his addiction was Peter Martins, then the artistic leader. "I was just so afraid," Ball said. "I told him, and he offered financial support and just said, 'Go heal.' I couldn't believe it. He said to me that the ballet will save me. And in a way he was right because it was always something that tethered me. It held me accountable.
"If I didn't have the ballet to show up to every day," he added, "I don't know if I would have lived."
Ball, who went to a rehab facility in Thailand -- "it was cheaper than rehab in America" -- said he was eager to talk about this part of his life because he knows that many struggle with addiction. "And it's not just the dance world," he said. "I mean, let's be real."
When Martins stepped down after accusations of physical and mental abuse, Ball went into panic mode. Martins, who was later cleared by an independent investigation, was the only person who knew why Ball was in Thailand. The assumption was that he was healing from an injury. "This guy came up to me and said, 'Oh, I just saw that your boss was #MeToo'd,"' Ball said. "I was like, What? I didn't even know that #MeToo had happened. In rehab, you're literally cut off."
Ball told the company about his situation and was put on disability. "They said, 'Just take your time,"' he recalled. He was out for a year and a half.
In recent seasons, he has taken on repertory that is more subtle, less virtuosic -- a calculated decision, he said, so that he could be onstage but not hurt himself. And he realized something. "I see everything that they were telling me," Ball said. "To be myself, to dance the way I wanted to dance and just to kind of throw it all away."
It took him years, he said, to be himself onstage. His farewell program offers a final chance, in a debut, Jerome Robbins's "Afternoon of a Faun," in which two dancers find themselves alone in a ballet studio with the audience, essentially, as their mirror. "That ballet feels so intimate," he said. "I think that it's the definition of what it is to be a dancer."
"Faun" begins and ends with Ball alone, stretched out on the floor. Earlier this week, Ball and Unity Phelan rehearsed it with the repertory director Jean-Pierre Frohlich. After a run-through, Phelan walked over to Ball. "This is going to be very emotional," she said, her voice cracking. "I'm walking away from you."
Ball said, "Are you crying?"
Frohlich had notes. "It's good," he said. "There was intimacy, which is what we want. The most important thing is do not perform. It does it. Trust it."
After Sunday's performance, Ball will have to trust himself, his future. He is working on a memoir. "I lived a lot of lives in the past 12, 13 years that I've been in this company," he said. "And I got the great privilege of dancing on some of the best stages in the world, dancing the best ballets in the world, dancing for the best dancers in the world, with the best dancers in the world. And I got to put this theater on my driver's license. Isn't that funny?"
He paused and added, "I have to change it now, though."

Can Hollywood Go Off Script?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Studios have moved up deadlines for TV writers, and late-night shows are preparing to go dark. But for other segments of the industry, it's business as usual.
Writers scrambling to finish scripts. Rival late-night-show hosts and producers convening group calls to discuss contingency plans. Union officials and screenwriters gathering in conference rooms to design picket signs with slogans like "The Future of Writing Is at Stake!"
With a Hollywood strike looming, there has been a frantic sprint throughout the entertainment world before 11,500 TV and movie writers potentially walk out as soon as next week.
The possibility of a television and movie writers' strike -- will they, won't they, how could they? -- has been the top conversation topic in the industry for weeks. And in recent days, there has been a notable shift: People have stopped asking one another whether a strike would take place and started to talk about duration. How long was the last one? (100 days in 2007-8.) How long was the longest one? (153 days in 1988.)
"It's the first topic that comes up in every meeting, every phone call, and everyone claims to have their own inside source about how long a strike will go on and whether the directors and actors will also go out, which would truly be a disaster," said Laura Lewis, the founder of Rebelle Media, a production and financing company behind shows like "Tell Me Lies" on Hulu and independent movies like "Mr. Malcolm's List."
Unions representing screenwriters have been negotiating with Hollywood's biggest studios for a new contract to replace the one that expires on Monday. The contracts for directors and actors expire on June 30.
"I support the writers," Ms. Lewis said. "It's challenging, though. Just as we are starting to recover from the pandemic, we could be going into a strike."
In recent weeks, television writers have been racing to meet deadlines that studios moved up. Worried about the possibility of having no income for months, some TV writers have been trying to push through new projects -- to get "commenced," Hollywood slang for a signed writing contract, which typically brings an upfront payment.
One prominent talent agent, who like some others in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said there was a "mad rush" to complete deals before next week. Some writers began removing their personal possessions from studio offices in anticipation of a walkout.
Likewise, studio executives began calling producers last week to tell them to act as if a strike were certain, and to make sure all last-minute tweaks were incorporated into scripts, so production on some series could continue even in the absence of writers on set. Executives have delayed production for other series until the fall in cases where they determined scripts were not entirely ready.
The president of one production company said this week that she was "freaking out" over a TV project in danger of falling apart because the star was available only for a limited period and the script was not ready.
The writers room for the hit ABC sitcom "Abbott Elementary" is supposed to convene on Monday -- the day the contract expires.
"I'm making plans to go back to work when we're supposed to go back to work," said Brittani Nichols, a producer and writer on the show. "And if that doesn't happen, I'll be at work on the picket line."
If there is a strike, which could begin as early as Tuesday, late-night shows, including ones hosted by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, are likely to go dark. Late-night hosts and their top producers have convened conference calls to discuss a coordinated response in the event of a strike, much as they did during the pandemic.
During the 2007 walkout, late-night shows went dark for two months before they began gradually returning in early 2008, even with writers still on picket lines. Jimmy Kimmel paid his staff out of his own pocket during the strike, and later explained that he had to return to the air because his savings were nearly wiped out.
Mr. Kimmel and other hosts, like Conan O'Brien, gamely tried to put together shows without their writers or their standard monologues. Jay Leno, on the other hand, wrote his own "Tonight Show" monologues, infuriating the writers' unions in the process.
Though there's plenty of uncertainty in TV circles, there are also segments of Hollywood where it has been business as usual.
Executives at streaming services seemed to exhibit what one senior William Morris Endeavor agent called a "frightening, freakish sense of calm," perhaps because they were betting that any strike would be short. Most streaming services have been under pressure to cut costs -- even deep-pocketed Amazon Studios laid off 100 people on Thursday -- and a strike is one quick way to do that: Spending would plummet as production slowed.
"It could lead to notably better-than-expected streaming profitability," Rich Greenfield, a founder of the LightShed Partners research firm, wrote to investors this month.
At several movie studios, there is little sense of alarm, partly because a strike would have almost no impact on the release schedule until next spring. (The movie business works nearly a year in advance.) One movie agent said everyone in her orbit was preparing for the Cannes Film Festival, which begins on May 16 and will include premieres for films like "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" and "Killers of the Flower Moon," the latest from Martin Scorsese. Many movie executives were also preoccupied with CinemaCon this week, a convention for theater operators in Las Vegas.
"The writers' process is like 18 months to two years away from movies' hitting our cinemas, generally, so you wouldn't see an impact for quite a while," said John Fithian, the departing chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners. "There is a whole lot of writing already in the can -- or the computer -- for projects the studios are putting into production."
At the Walt Disney Company, the largest supplier of union-covered TV dramas and comedies (890 episodes for the 2021-22 season), more immediate worries have been the focus. Disney began to hand out thousands of pink slips on Monday as part of an unrelated plan to eliminate 7,000 jobs worldwide by the end of June. The company made news again on Wednesday when it sued Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
During previous union walkouts, television networks ordered more reality programming, which does not fall under the writers' unions jurisdiction. The long-running "Cops" was ordered during the 1988 strike, while the 2007-8 strike helped supercharge shows like "The Celebrity Apprentice" and "The Biggest Loser."
Paul Neinstein, co-chief executive of the Project X production company, which made the most recent "Scream" movie and Netflix's "The Night Agent," said there had been a huge increase in reality TV pitches over the last month, even though his production company was not known for making unscripted television.
"All of a sudden everybody's got a reality show," he said. "And that to me feels very strike-related."

The Wild Life and Times of a Soon-to-Be Former City Ballet Dancer

NEW YORK — Harrison Ball, a principal at New York City Ballet, has tears in his toes. His sesamoid bone is crushed and, he said, dying. There is bone shard sticking into a tendon in his foot. His arthritis is so bad that his doctor told him it was comparable to that of an elderly person. He can’t do his job if he can’t pirouette.
So Sunday, he’s leaving his job. He’s barely 30.
Such an early farewell is not the norm. But for Ball, who was promoted to the rank of principal dancer just last year, the injuries were too much.
“It’s gotten to the point where I just can’t do my job without being in an enormous amount of pain,” he said.
Even with that pain, Ball has been performing in new, intriguing ways. As the Poet in “La Sonnambula” and Puck in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” both George Balanchine ballets, his seriousness, his investment as a dramatic dancer brought a new urgency to the characters.
“I could just see his future right in front of me lining up,” said Wendy Whelan, City Ballet’s associate artistic director.
Whelan is trying to look at the bigger picture in terms of Ball and others who have parted ways with the company since the pandemic started. There have been more than a few and from all ranks, including Jonathan Fahoury, Claire Kretzschmar and Lauren Lovette.
“Everybody knows leaving is scary,” she said. “Artists, young people are a little more courageous a little sooner.”
Whelan and Jonathan Stafford, the company’s artistic director, had been excited to promote Ball.
“He’s such a technician and this classicist and also contemporary and free — he’s an investigator, you know?” Whelan said. “You always love when you have a dancer like that at your fingertips to guide and help. He could morph.”
Ball is looking more toward acting in his future. He just got a part on the ballet-world series “Étoile,” coming to Amazon, by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “Bunheads.” He’s also focused on choreography: His “Purcell Suite,” a work for New Jersey Ballet, will be performed at Kaatsbaan Cultural Park in June. His personal life has come together, too. He is engaged to fashion designer Zac Posen, whom he met at City Ballet and became close with during the pandemic.
Ball, disarming and funny, has a spontaneous streak. Much of his life has been erratic and wild, fueled, in part, by drug and alcohol addiction. (He was partial to cocaine, he said; he’s been sober for more than five years.) Even Ball’s childhood was unorthodox. He started ballet training at 4 with the now-defunct Charleston Ballet Theatre in South Carolina and performed as a child.
“I was this little kid, and I was touring with all these adults,” he said. “During the day, the dancers would take me with them during the lunch break. They would all go to a bar.”
When he was about 15 and a student at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, he lost his dorm privileges as a result of disciplinary action; with his family’s support, he lived on his own in an apartment, he said, with his mother checking in on him periodically from South Carolina, where she and her husband were raising two other sons. Soon, he was fully on his own.
“It was a really weird situation,” Vera Ball, his mother, said, “but, yeah, that’s what we had to do.”
She added, “I just wanted him to be able to be him, and this was where it was.”
He was enrolled at the Professional Children’s School, which specializes in educating young artists, athletes and others, but stopped going. As a ballet student and as a member of City Ballet, which he joined in 2012, he was something of a party animal. He had a steady paycheck but was always short on cash.
When he was 24, he broke both of his feet in a rehearsal. He wasn’t even dancing when it happened.
“I was talking, and I took a step on my right foot, and it went” — Ball clicked his tongue to make a popping sound — “and then I took a step on my left foot” — he clicked again — “and I just fell.”
Instead of crying, he laughed. Surely this was a sign.
“I had a really rampant alcohol problem at that time,” he said. “I was using a lot of drugs. I was homeless for a while. I was living in a car.”
He slept and showered at the theater, he said. The address on his driver’s license still reads 20 Lincoln Center Plaza.
“It was a really wild moment for me,” he said. “And the hardest part of it was keeping up the facade, right? Because nobody really knew.”
The only person at the company he had told about his addiction was Peter Martins, then the artistic leader.
“I was just so afraid,” Ball said. “I told him, and he offered financial support and just said, ‘Go heal.’ I couldn’t believe it. He said to me that the ballet will save me. And in a way he was right because it was always something that tethered me. It held me accountable.
“If I didn’t have the ballet to show up to every day,” he added, “I don’t know if I would have lived.”
Ball, who went to a rehab facility in Thailand — “it was cheaper than rehab in America” — said he was eager to talk about this part of his life because he knows that many struggle with addiction.
“And it’s not just the dance world,” he said. “I mean, let’s be real.”
When Martins stepped down after accusations of physical and mental abuse, Ball went into panic mode. Martins, who was later cleared by an independent investigation, was the only person who knew why Ball was in Thailand. The assumption was that he was healing from an injury.
“This guy came up to me and said, ‘Oh, I just saw that your boss was #MeToo’d,’” Ball said. “I was like, What ? I didn’t even know that #MeToo had happened. In rehab, you’re literally cut off.”
Ball told the company about his situation and was put on disability.
“They said, ‘Just take your time,’” he recalled.
He was out for a year and a half.
In recent seasons, he has taken on repertory that is more subtle, less virtuosic — a calculated decision, he said, so that he could be onstage but not hurt himself. And he realized something.
“I see everything that they were telling me,” Ball said. “To be myself, to dance the way I wanted to dance and just to kind of throw it all away.”
It took him years, he said, to be himself onstage. His farewell program offers a final chance, in a debut, Jerome Robbins’ “Afternoon of a Faun,” in which two dancers find themselves alone in a ballet studio with the audience essentially as their mirror.

“Faun” begins and ends with Ball alone stretched out on the floor. Earlier this week, Ball and Unity Phelan rehearsed it with repertory director Jean-Pierre Frohlich. After a run-through, Phelan walked over to Ball.
“This is going to be very emotional,” she said, her voice cracking. “I’m walking away from you.”
Ball said, “Are you crying?”
Frohlich had notes.
“It’s good,” he said. “There was intimacy, which is what we want. The most important thing is do not perform. It does it. Trust it.”
After Sunday’s performance, Ball will have to trust himself, his future. He is working on a memoir.
“I lived a lot of lives in the past 12, 13 years that I’ve been in this company,” he said. “And I got the great privilege of dancing on some of the best stages in the world, dancing the best ballets in the world, dancing for the best dancers in the world, with the best dancers in the world. And I got to put this theater on my driver’s license. Isn’t that funny?”
He paused and added, “I have to change it now, though.”

Hollywood, Both Frantic and Calm, Braces for Writers’ Strike

Writers scrambling to finish scripts. Rival late-night-show hosts and producers convening group calls to discuss contingency plans. Union officials and screenwriters gathering in conference rooms to design picket signs with slogans like “The Future of Writing Is at Stake!”
With a Hollywood strike looming, there has been a frantic sprint throughout the entertainment world before 11,500 TV and movie writers potentially walk out as soon as next week.
The possibility of a television and movie writers’ strike — will they, won’t they, how could they? — has been the top conversation topic in the industry for weeks. And in recent days, there has been a notable shift: People have stopped asking one another whether a strike would take place and started to talk about duration. How long was the last one? (100 days in 2007-08.) How long was the longest one? (153 days in 1988.)
“It’s the first topic that comes up in every meeting, every phone call, and everyone claims to have their own inside source about how long a strike will go on and whether the directors and actors will also go out, which would truly be a disaster,” said Laura Lewis, the founder of Rebelle Media, a production and financing company behind shows like “Tell Me Lies” on Hulu and independent movies like “Mr. Malcolm’s List.”
Unions representing screenwriters have been negotiating with Hollywood’s biggest studios for a new contract to replace the one that expires on Monday. The contracts for directors and actors expire on June 30.
“I support the writers,” Lewis said. “It’s challenging, though. Just as we are starting to recover from the pandemic, we could be going into a strike.”
In recent weeks, television writers have been racing to meet deadlines that studios moved up. Worried about the possibility of having no income for months, some TV writers have been trying to push through new projects — to get “commenced,” Hollywood slang for a signed writing contract, which typically brings an upfront payment.

Full text: It's an awards presentation, a Hallmark Channel-style TV drama, a beauty pageant and a reality show. And the N.F.L. really knows how to sell.
Follow our live coverage of the 2023 N.F.L. draft.
The N.F.L. has televised its draft since 1980, and soon after, pro sports leagues realized they could sell rights to their selection shows to emerging cable networks thirsty for content. In the four decades since, football's rookie roll call has far eclipsed those of its sports peers, giving the N.F.L. draft popularity on a par with whoever headlines the Grammys and bigger than HBO's "Succession."
For three days, a sport built on violent collisions holds what amounts to a football festival that traffics in heart-tugging stories and innocent fun. At last year's draft, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell -- a brawny former player himself -- turned to greet Devin Lloyd, the 6-foot-3 linebacker who'd just been selected, and offered the customary handshake and hug. To Goodell's shock, Lloyd leaned in and snatched his new boss off the ground in a motion so fluid that Goodell simply tucked his feet back and broke out into a laugh.
Afterward, Lloyd's mother, Ronyta Johnson, said she'd told him to do it on a whim. "I just wanted to see if he could," she said.
Such moments can't begin to justify why the N.F.L. draft, which begins Thursday in Kansas City, Mo., draws an audience of upward of 11 million people every year for broadcasts across four networks. Even at its worst, the draft is a hit.
In 2021, when Goodell announced picks from a stage in Cleveland, cameras cut to the first player picked, whose name had been expected to be called first for months. The player, Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence, watched, like the rest of America, from home. More TV viewers showed up to witness that formality than saw "Nomadland" win the Academy Award for best picture that year.
How did pro forma sports programming come to have that kind of cultural pull? Part of the answer lies in football's stranglehold on our TV screens. Twenty-two N.F.L. games were among the top 25 prime-time telecasts in 2022, making the sport the most reliable destination viewing of anything the networks could cook up.
Football's viewership has been a key driver of its revenue, the league's talent for spectacle turning America's most popular sport into its most profitable one. The N.F.L. signed media deals worth over $ 100 billion in 2021 and has since inked a $ 2 billion deal with YouTube for the rights to stream Sunday games. Amazon is paying $ 1 billion to stream games on Thursdays, and this year the N.F.L. will add a game played on Black Friday for the tech giant's Prime shoppers. It will also air 75 hours of draft coverage on the league-owned NFL Network, with more footage streamed on NFL+, the NFL App, NFL.com and NFL Channel.
"There's no other N.F.L.," said Jim Minnich, a senior vice president for revenue and yield management at Disney Advertising. Minnich runs the group that sells ad inventory for ESPN and ABC's broadcast of the three-day event, over 35 hours of programming, which is sold out this year and is expected to pull in $ 16 million for Disney. "There's a lot of noise out there this time of year, and the N.F.L. just cuts through."
As proof, Minnich offered a statistic: The number of people searching online for draft advertisers was 41 percent higher than that of an average prime-time broadcast. He attributed this to storytelling. The N.F.L. schedules a pick every 15 minutes, and to fill the time between them the networks air short biographies of the player who was just selected. That way viewers go on a brief emotional journey that leads to a satisfying denouement (burly guys in N.F.L. caps tearing up and hugging their moms and dads).
A spokesman for ESPN said the network would produce 600 player highlight packages and had plans to zoom in on 50 live shots of prospects as they waited to hear their names called. This after pundits in sports media and on bar stools and message boards have spent three months predicting which team will want which player.
As with award shows and beauty pageants, the N.F.L. draft gets really juicy when cameras lock in on the contestants whose names aren't called. When Aaron Rodgers was passed over for the top pick in 2005 by the San Francisco 49ers, the team he spent his childhood rooting for, he spent four hours agonizing in front of TV cameras until the Green Bay Packers took him with the 24th pick.
"The Lord has been teaching me a lot about humility and patience, and he kind of threw both of those in my face today," Rodgers, then 21, said. Now 39 and a four-time N.F.L. most valuable player, he was recently traded to the Jets.
"It's embarrassing," he told ESPN after his long draft night. "You know the whole world is watching, your phone's buzzing every two minutes and you're hoping it's a team calling. But it's just your buddies just making jokes, and it's hard to laugh in a situation where you know everybody's laughing at you."
The squirming of stranded players can give a palpable focal point to the buildup, while unseen coaches and clipboard-holders decide their futures. Though the league pays players' airfare and hotel expenses to make the trip to the draft live show, they aren't paid to appear.
In some cases, agents advise against showing up, lest the player suffer the humiliation of an awkward, televised wait. Only 17 of the 259 players who will be drafted planned to attend the event and sit in the cordoned-off green room/fishbowl. Those who attend will do so for roughly the same reason that college seniors sit through graduation speeches: The ceremony, as uncomfortable as it is, is a symbolic finish line.
Bryce Young, the Alabama quarterback who is projected to be the top pick in this year's draft, said he expected the night to be "surreal."
"Walking across that stage and hearing your name called, and I'm going to be able to experience that with my family, which is a big blessing and moment for me to cherish and be grateful," he said.
The huge audience for such a moment also offers the first major opportunity for a player to showcase his personality for mass consumption.
"A lot of these guys on draft night are really trying to make a name, trying to make a splash," said Cam Wolf, a senior style writer for GQ, adding that sponsorship and branding opportunities await athletes who make the right sartorial choices.
Wolf said a tipping point came in 2016 when Ezekiel Elliott, a running back who liked to wear cropped T-shirts as he warmed up for college games at Ohio State, opened his baby blue shawl-collared suit jacket to reveal a tailored button up that had been abbreviated at midriff. Elliott's abs were soon wallpapering the internet.
Viewers "watch it for the clothes, but not in terms of getting style inspiration," Wolf said, noting that GQ has ramped up its coverage of the N.F.L. draft red carpet in the years since. He added, "They want to be part of the discourse, and the outfits is such an easy way to do that."
It's all so different from the X's and O's conversation that muffles N.F.L. game days, when those same athletes will be in uniform, trying to stand out with a big catch or a combustible tackle. There's a massive audience for that, too. The N.F.L. now has games on four of the seven days in a week, for the six months of the season, which in 2021 was extended an extra week.
And when there aren't games to be played, the N.F.L., like the Marvel franchise and the known universe, finds other ways of expanding.

Pope Gives Women a Vote in Influential Bishops Meeting: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The move is an important step by Francis as he strives for greater inclusiveness.
ROME -- When Francis became pope a decade ago, his inclusive tone and openness to change fueled expectations among many Catholic women about a greater role for them in the Roman Catholic Church.
The contribution of women should not be limited "to altar girls or the president of a charity," he said in a 2013 news conference aboard the papal plane. "There must be more."
Francis remains adamant in his opposition to ordaining women as priests and cautious about making women deacons. But on Wednesday he took what may be his most important step to give women a greater voice in the church. He approved changes that will for the first time allow women and lay people to vote at a major meeting of bishops that the pope has repeatedly made clear will be a central deliberative body to help him determine the future of the church.
That meeting, set to begin next October, will focus on better engaging the faithful as the church moves forward and is expected to take on major issues such as the role of women in the church and L.G.B.T.Q. relationships. It will now include an additional 70 non-bishop voting members, half of whom the pope wants to be women. The proportion of women voters overall would be just over 10 percent.
"It's an important change," said Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich, a top organizer of the meeting of bishops, called a synod. "It's not a revolution."
The rules change, while seemingly procedural, amounts to a concrete shift toward the democratization of the church, a central tenet of the Francis papacy that views the abuse of power in an aloof hierarchy as the cause of many of the church's problems. Conservatives have for a decade now warned that Francis' efforts to open up the church would dilute its traditions and expose it to secular ideology.
Conservatives saw the rules presented Wednesday as further evidence of that erosion. But those who support expanded roles for women said Francis had finally delivered real change after years of being urged.
"It's an incredible development in the church's history and something that we're celebrating as a significant crack in the stained-glass ceiling," said Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women's Ordination Conference, who said it was very encouraging to see a "growing trend toward gender parity in the synod hall."
The change, however, does not mean that Francis himself has had a conversion on the more fundamental issues that remain important to women's advocates in the church.
He has spoken in sometimes folksy terms about women's contributions -- once calling a group of female theologians the "strawberry on the cake" -- in ways that some have found diminishing or demeaning.
But he has also evolved, steadily giving women more of a voice inside both local parishes and the Vatican bureaucracy that governs the church.
In 2022, he added women to the committee that advises him on picking the world's bishops. In 2021, Francis amended the church's laws so that women could be Bible readers at Mass, serve at the altar and distribute communion -- practices already common in many countries.
But for years, some lay Catholics have wanted more -- especially for more women to be included in its synodal meetings, which are vital under Francis, who believes in a collegial process before making big changes.
Some church analysts see the upcoming bishops' meeting from Oct. 4 to 29, known as the "Synod on Synodality," as a major event, comparable to a mini version of the Second Vatican Council, dear to Francis, that modernized the church in the 1960s.
For two years the church has surveyed lay members around the globe about changes they would like to see in the church to better fit their needs. The pope's liberal supporters are hoping that he will use the meetings and the votes of all participants on major issues to inform decisions to bring about real change on issues ranging from allowing some married men in remote areas to become priests, to permitting divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion.
But the composition of the voting body has long been a source of conflict.
In 2018, a petition that called for the inclusion of nuns as voting members in a synod on youth in the church gained nearly 10,000 signatures. Some liberal Catholic activists staged protests at the Vatican demanding that the female participants at that meeting be given the right to vote "as equals alongside their brothers in Christ."
In the 2019 special synod for countries in the Amazon region, which broached the issue of allowing married men to become priests, women took part as observers, but could not vote.
The new norms presented by the Vatican Wednesday also stipulated that 10 male representatives of various Catholic religious orders voting in the synod would be replaced by five male clerics and five nuns with voting rights. One of the synod's two undersecretaries, Nathalie Becquart, a nun, can now also vote.
"All those who participate in the synod will vote," Francis told the Argentine newspaper La Nacion in an interview last month. "Whether male or female. Everyone, everyone. That word everyone for me is key."
The pope can also add other participants, according to the new rules.
Key to the changes approved by Francis is an expansion of the participants to include lay people as voting members, reflecting Francis' vision for a greater role for the rank-and-file faithful in their churches, rather than leaving all decision-making in the hands of the hierarchy of priests, bishops and cardinals.
"In the synod, lay men and women will also have the right to vote" read a headline on Vatican News, the church's official outlet.
"It's church changing. It is paradigm changing, it is literally restructuring one of the most important ways that the church makes decisions and looks at pastoral issues within the church," said Deborah Rose, co-director of Future Church, an organization seeking greater involvement of laypeople.
"There will be times we are disappointed because he won't follow through as he has decreed," she added. "Nonetheless, what he has done is open a dam and opened a door, and I think there's no going back."
Conservative critics of Francis, some of whom disdain the synod on synodality as a bureaucratic circus that undercuts the majesty of the church, excoriated the new rules as a Trojan Horse for a liberal ideological invasion of the church.
"It is clear that Pope Francis" and the cardinals leading the synod "are trying, in every way, to bring into this institution all those people who have an interest in disrupting the church for their own personal ambitions," read a post on the conservative Catholic site Silere non possum. "No longer finding many bishops willing to trample on Christ's teaching, they are now turning to ambitious lay people."
But even the generally liberal Cardinals who spoke about the new rules on Wednesday insisted that the overwhelming influence of the synod remained in the hands of the bishops known as "synodal fathers."
"The 70 new members are 21 percent of the assembly, which remains an assembly of bishops," Cardinal Hollerich, archbishop of Luxembourg, told reporters, declining to speak for the women when asked how they would refer to themselves.
Cardinal Mario Grech, another top synod official, doubled down.
"The Synod will remain a Synod of Bishops," he said, though one enriched by the participation of lay members.
But Ms. McElwee, who still hopes women will one day be ordained as priests, believed the "inclusion of women in this sort of significant way will change the church, will create new conversations and new ways of making decisions within the church."

Full text: One of the first major studies on remote work shows a hidden penalty of flexibility: less supervision.
At least 10 times a day, Erika Becker, who works as a sales development manager at a technology company called Verkada, turns to her boss with questions. "Did I handle that correctly?" she asks. "What could I have done better?"
Ms. Becker, 28, comes into her office in San Mateo, Calif., five days a week, along with all her colleagues. The routine is a stark departure from her previous role at Yelp, where she worked from home and often spoke with her boss by phone just once in a day. Ms. Becker has rediscovered an upside of the office: feedback. Lots of it.
"It's like if there's something in my teeth, I want you to tell me," she said. "Because I want to move up in my career."
Since the start of the pandemic, sweeping workplace changes have arrived far faster than the research examining their effects. More than 50 million Americans, largely in white-collar jobs, began working from home at least part of the time. Many of them, especially working parents, became fiercely attached to the flexibility. In recent months, as large employers -- including Amazon, Disney and Starbucks -- have tried to call workers back to the office, thousands of employees have objected, pointing to a track record of productivity at home.
But remote workers may be paying a hidden professional penalty for that flexibility, according to a working paper from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the University of Iowa and Harvard. The research is among the first major studies to demonstrate the professional downside of remote work.
The economists -- Natalia Emanuel, Emma Harrington and Amanda Pallais -- studied engineers at a large technology company. They found that remote work enhanced the productivity of senior engineers, but it also reduced the amount of feedback that junior engineers received (in the form of comments on their code), and some of the junior engineers were more likely to quit the firm. The effects of remote work, in terms of declining feedback, were especially pronounced for female engineers.
"We find a now-versus-later trade-off associated with remote work," said Ms. Harrington, an economist at the University of Iowa. "Particularly for junior engineers who are new to this particular firm, and younger engineers, they receive less feedback from their senior colleagues when they're remote."
The study's findings are preliminary and relatively narrow, directly measuring just one form of interaction among one set of workers at one technology firm. But the authors said their findings suggested something broader: that the office, at least for a certain type of white-collar knowledge worker, played an important role in early-career development. And the mentorship and training people get in person had so far proved hard to replicate on Slack and Zoom.
"It's what grandparents have been saying for a long time," Ms. Emanuel, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview this month. "Face-to-face meetings are very different from FaceTime."
For some major employers, the research confirms a sentiment that has guided their decision-making on hybrid work: "It's hard to replicate the opportunities for apprenticeship and learning that come from in-person interactions," said Sara Wechter, head of human resources at Citi, where most employees are in the office at least three days a week.
At Verkada, the Bay Area-based technology company that called its workers back into the office five days a week, interviews with several employees showed why some people were choosing to leave jobs with flexible work arrangements in search of an office where they could cultivate relationships.
Morgan Shapiro, who joined Verkada in November 2020, had previously worked at Lyft, where she struggled to manage her team of recruiters once the pandemic sent workers home. When questions came up throughout the day, she worried about reaching out to her employees spontaneously, because she knew the anxiety that a sudden calendar invitation could provoke.
During her first week at Verkada, back in an office, she realized what she had been missing. She bumped into the company's chief executive in the hallway, and he invited her to set up a meeting to talk about her department's approach to compensation, which had come up during her job interview. She emailed his assistant to schedule the conversation right away.
"I also knew his assistant because I had gotten coffee with her," Ms. Shapiro, 36, said. "If I was remote, that would have been a lot harder because she would have said, 'Who is this person trying to get time with the C.E.O.?"'
Ms. Shapiro, who had a baby this year, noted that increased flexibility in her field had also made it easier for in-office employees to give priority to child care when crises arose. "Of course if you need to be home, be home," she said. "Home is first."
Ms. Shapiro's experience highlights a particular challenge for companies and workers navigating return-to-office tensions: The career penalty for remote work may be greatest for women, young people and people of color, who often lack the professional networks that being in the office can help provide. But numerous surveys find that those same groups of workers are also the ones who value flexible arrangements the most, and who are the least likely to return to the office voluntarily.
"Those who want remote work -- those who will likely take advantage of remote work -- are likely those who will lose jobs or at least lose out on opportunities because of remote work," said Kweilin Ellingrud, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute who has studied how remote work affects career development.
Worse, Ms. Ellingrud said, the price of flexibility may not be obvious to workers or companies until years later, when disparities in pay or promotion emerge.
Take Jackiez Gonzalez, 36, who works remotely in social impact for Best Buy, and signed up for a mentoring program for employees of color. She was told that participants would gather regularly to discuss career development. But she learned a month after signing up that she'd been accidentally left off the calendar invitations for meetings.
"When you're remote, you're out of sight, out of mind," Ms. Gonzalez said of the experience, adding that while she has largely felt positive about her flexible work arrangements, "there are growing pains."
The intangible benefits of in-person work have been challenging for researchers to study because they are, by definition, hard to measure. Existing studies of remote work have tended to focus on call centers or similar workplaces where productivity is easy to define and measure -- but where creativity, collaboration and mentorship may be less important.
Ms. Emanuel and her colleagues focused on software engineers at a Fortune 500 technology company, which the researchers had agreed not to identify. Before the pandemic, some engineering teams at the company were working in the same building, holding meetings in person and interacting with colleagues in the cafeteria. Other teams were split between buildings and held most of their meetings online to avoid the 20-minute walk across the company's campus.
The economists were able to measure feedback by looking at the number of comments that engineers made on one another's code -- a routine and essential form of interaction at most software companies. They found that before the pandemic, engineers working in the same building received 21 percent more feedback than those working in different buildings. Once the pandemic hit, and everyone worked remotely, the feedback gap virtually disappeared, suggesting it had been physical proximity -- not some other difference between the groups -- that had led to greater feedback for in-person teams.
The "power of proximity," as the researchers call it in their paper's title, was particularly large for newly hired engineers, younger workers and women. Engineers under age 30, for example, tended to receive more feedback, especially from their more experienced colleagues -- but only if they were all in the same building.
"These effects are really concentrated," Ms. Emanuel said. "The folks who really benefit the most from being in person are junior engineers and also are younger. Those are the groups that you might imagine have the most to learn."
Notably, engineers -- especially younger workers and women -- who had previously been on teams that were all in the same building were more likely to quit their jobs once the pandemic sent everyone home. There was no such surge in departures among people who had previously worked on teams spread across multiple buildings. That suggested workers missed in-person interactions, Ms. Emanuel said.
The challenge for companies is that remote work has also brought real benefits for many employees, particularly for working parents and others juggling responsibilities at work and at home. In a survey from FlexJobs, the remote job search site, 60 percent of women and 52 percent of men said they would consider looking for a new job if they could no longer work remotely; 62 percent of women and 56 percent of men said better work-life balance was a benefit of remote work.
"Employee sentiment on remote work is crystal clear," said Reyhan Ayas, senior economist at Revelio Labs, which collects and analyzes job postings, layoff notices and other work force data. "Employees, if they are able to work from home, would like to work from home."
Many companies have embraced a hybrid model, permitting some employees to work remotely while allowing or requiring others to be in the office. Still, the "power of proximity" paper calls that approach into question: The economists found that the benefits of in-person work apply only when an entire team is physically together.
"If you have even one remote teammate, that can still result in less collaboration between the remaining teammates," Ms. Emanuel said.
Still, many hybrid-work experts maintain that companies can find inventive ways of supporting their remote workers. There are even technologies emerging to enable that, including Gatheround, a videoconferencing platform that, among other functions, ensures all meeting participants get equal time to speak -- by cutting people off once they've gone on longer than their colleagues. Lisa Conn, Gatheround's chief executive, advises companies offering flexible work to have in-person attendees, even if some are together in the same space, join hybrid meetings on their own laptops.
Back at Verkada, Ms. Becker attributes parts of her growth at work to the time she has spent in the office. She has become a more critical manager, comfortable with prompting her 19 sales representatives to discuss ways they need to improve.
"When I came in as a manager, I was everybody's biggest cheerleader," she said. "What I struggled with is having tough conversations."
She made the shift because of advice she got from her own boss, who sits next to her: "It's having a mentor tell you -- 'Hey, you gave that feedback. Are they implementing it?"'

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If the regulation is implemented, it will be the first time the federal government has limited carbon emissions from existing power plants, which generate 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases.
WASHINGTON -- President Biden's administration is poised to announce limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that could compel them to capture the pollution from their smokestacks, technology now used by fewer than 10 of the nation's 3,400 coal and gas-fired plants, according to three people who were briefed on the rule.
If implemented, the proposed regulation would be the first time the federal government has restricted carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, which generate about 25 percent of the planet-warming pollution produced by the United States. It would also apply to future plants.
Almost all coal and gas-fired power plants would have to cut or capture nearly all of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2040, according to the people familiar with the regulation, who asked not to be identified because the rule has not been made public.
The proposed rule is sure to face opposition from the fossil fuel industry, power plant operators and their allies in Congress. It is likely to draw an immediate legal challenge from a group of Republican attorneys general that has already sued the Biden administration to stop other climate policies. A future administration could also weaken the regulation.
The regulation, proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, is being reviewed by the White House's Office of Management and Budget, and could still be adjusted.
Maria Michalos, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, said the agency is "moving urgently to advance standards that protect people and the planet, building on the momentum from President Biden's Investing in America economic agenda, including proposals to address carbon emissions from new and existing power plants."
It would not mandate the use of carbon capture equipment, a nascent and expensive technology; rather, it would set caps on pollution rates that plant operators would have to meet. They could do that by using a different technology or, in the case of gas plants, switching to a fuel source like green hydrogen, which does not emit carbon, according to the people familiar with the matter. But the regulation could lead to the broader adoption of carbon capture technology, the people said.
Most of the electricity generated in the United States last year -- about 60 percent -- came from burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and petroleum, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The proposal comes on the heels of two other Biden administration plans to cut tailpipe emissions dramatically by speeding up the country's transition to electric vehicles, and curb methane leaks from oil and gas wells.
If those three regulations are implemented as proposed, they would significantly reduce the planet-warming pollution created by the world's largest economy. Together with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a law that is pouring $ 370 billion into clean energy programs, they would put the country on track to meet Mr. Biden's pledge to cut the country's emissions roughly in half by 2030, and to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2050.
That is the action required of all major industrialized countries, scientists say, to keep average global temperatures from increasing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, the effects of catastrophic heat waves, flooding, drought, crop failure and species extinction would become significantly harder for humanity to handle. The planet has already warmed by an average of 1.1 degrees Celsius.
Mr. Biden has said that he is willing to use his executive authority to act on global warming, a point he has recently stressed after facing sharp criticism from environmentalists, particularly young climate activists, for his decision last month to approve an enormous oil drilling project on pristine land in Alaska, known as Willow.
"We have to do more than recognize the climate challenges we face," Mr. Biden told other world leaders during a virtual gathering on Thursday to discuss climate and energy. "We are determined to strengthen our ambition and our actions. And, yes, we're willing to do the hard work to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius."
In releasing a climate rule for power plants, Mr. Biden hopes to succeed where his former boss, President Barack Obama, failed. Nearly a decade ago, Mr. Obama tried to enact broad limits on power plant pollution that were first blocked by the Supreme Court and then rolled back by President Donald J. Trump. Last summer, the Supreme Court confirmed that the E.P.A. had the authority to regulate carbon emissions from power plants but in a limited way.
But three factors have emboldened the Biden administration. First, carbon capture technology has advanced since the Obama administration. Second, when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act last year, they added language that classified greenhouse gases as pollutants to be regulated by the E.P.A. Lastly, the new law provides tax credits to power plant operators that capture their carbon, making the technology more financially feasible.
Instead of creating one limit that all power plants must comply with, the E.P.A. intends to be flexible, the people familiar with the new plan said. It plans to set various targets based on the size of the plant, whether it runs regularly or intermittently, and whether it is already scheduled for retirement. Some coal plants that are scheduled to shut down in the next decade may not have to meet the new standards at all.
Patrick Morrisey, the Republican attorney general of West Virginia, a major coal-producing state, said on Friday that he and others were waiting to see Mr. Biden's plan. "We are eager to review the E.P.A.'s new proposed rule on power plants, and we'll be ready once again to lead the charge in the fight against federal overreach," he said in a statement.
Some environmental groups are also critical of carbon capture technology, arguing that it makes more sense to switch to wind, solar and other clean energy sources that don't pollute in the first place.
Like the proposed regulations governing tailpipe emissions and methane from oil and gas facilities, the power plant rules would be subject to a public comment period and are not likely to be finalized and implemented until next year.
The Biden administration is racing to implement the trio of proposed regulations before Republicans can have a chance to nullify them if they win control of Congress in 2024. Under the Congressional Review Act, a new Congress elected next November could reach back and overturn agency regulations that were finalized within 60 days of the previous Congress.
The crackdown on emissions from automobiles, oil and gas facilities and power plants comes as Mr. Biden prepares to announce his bid for re-election, when he will need the young voters who helped him win the White House in 2020.
At the virtual meeting on Thursday with leaders of other major economies, Mr. Biden said he would seek $ 500 million from Congress to fight deforestation in the Amazon. On Friday, he signed an executive order to create the White House Office of Environmental Justice and to require every federal agency to develop plans to address the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate change on minority and tribal communities.
"Just since I became president, I've flown over literally thousands of acres of land burned flat by wildfire because of environmental changes," he told environmental activists at a Rose Garden ceremony, where he signed the order. "I've seen too many communities turned to rubble by storms growing more frequent and ferocious. It's an existential threat to our nation and literally to the world."
Still, electric utilities have complained that any policy that forces them to install carbon capture technology would be far too expensive, driving up energy costs for consumers.
A 2021 report by a group of 600 global investors, including BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and other top shareholders of U.S. investor-owned utilities, said the high costs of carbon capture "make it a risky and potentially expensive decarbonization strategy."
But some experts say that conditions surrounding carbon capture technology are shifting.
Once considered by many to be a boondoggle, the technology has matured. The Biden administration is investing billions in research and demonstration projects to advance it further. And while there are only about 40 power plants and other industrial sites with the equipment worldwide, that number is growing, albeit slowly. Calpine Corporation, one of the country's largest generators of electricity from natural gas, is building enormous carbon capture and sequestration facilities for its power generators in Deer Park, Texas.
The Inflation Reduction Act offers incentives to speed up adoption. The law raised existing federal tax credits for electric utilities that capture their carbon dioxide pollution to a range of $ 60 to $ 85 per ton of carbon dioxide, up from $ 35 to $ 50. That could translate into hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for major power companies.
"To date, the power sector has not found it economical to build," said Carrie Jenks, the executive director of the Environmental and Energy Law program at Harvard. "But the I.R.A.'s incentives really reduce the cost and make it economically viable. We are seeing companies want to build."

Full text: Documenting the damage of last month's earthquakes in Turkey.
Times graphics reporters Anjali Singhvi and Bedel Saget recently traveled to Antakya, a Turkish city badly damaged by February's earthquakes. Based on their reporting, they published an article this week that walks through the damage in Antakya's Old City, a commercial and religious hub.
The initial quakes were several weeks ago, but the damage continues to dominate life in much of Turkey and Syria. I spoke with Anjali and Bedel about what they saw in Antakya.
Ashley: What surprised you about Antakya's destruction?
Bedel: I had in my mind what the destruction would look like, but when you're driving around and seeing residential building after residential building flattened, it stops you in your tracks. We saw a building split in half -- half had collapsed and half was still standing -- and we could see an entire dining room set still present on the third floor, as though it were a dollhouse.
Anjali: We also saw so many photographs of missing people placed right outside the damaged buildings. I had assumed they were part of residents' belongings in that building, but a local journalist told me that families left photos of their loved ones around the site of the rubble so that if someone clears debris or continues the search, those photos might help identify bodies.
Times graphics reporters often use satellite imagery to reconstruct disaster sites. Why was actually being in Antakya important for this project?
Anjali: Before the trip, I had identified some areas from drone imagery of Antakya that seemed most damaged, and speculated that those areas could be good to cover. But when I was reporting on the ground, all the locals talked about an area I hadn't considered: Old City, a historic part of Antakya.
Old City was home to so many different kinds of buildings -- churches, mosques, a synagogue, restored boutique hotels, jewelry shops, silk stores, a local favorite hummus shop, just real gems. Amid the rubble, we saw government officials putting up signs on various buildings in Old City, labeling them as important cultural assets and warning people not to tamper anymore with the debris. From being there, I saw how Antakya had history in its soil, its buildings and its people. And it was Old City that really brought the community together.
Did you get the sense that residents wanted to stay as Antakya rebuilds?
Bedel: Quite a number of people left if they had the means to: Either they had family in other parts of Turkey or if they had homes elsewhere. But among those who stayed, everyone we spoke to talked about the commitment to rebuild, no matter what.
The things that made Old City a gathering spot -- the atmosphere, the aura, the embrace of different cultures -- I could feel that's what they longed for most. I spoke to a young woman, who recently graduated from medical school, who said, "It was good before, but we didn't understand before we lost our city, how important it was to us."
See what was lost in Antakya's Old City, through one street at the heart of the community.
Anjali is a reporter and a former architect whose work at The Times includes reconstructing building disasters, such as a Bronx apartment fire and Miami's Surfside condo collapse. Bedel joined The Times in 1991, and has covered hurricanes, wildfires and nine Olympic Games.

Man Who Shot Teen on Porch Faces Charges: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lawyers for the family of Ralph Yarl, 16, said he was critically injured when he was shot twice in Kansas City, Mo.
The errand that nearly cost Ralph Yarl his life was of the sort that falls to older brothers everywhere.
Ralph, a Black 16-year-old in Kansas City, Mo., had been sent to pick up his younger twin brothers at a friend's house on Thursday evening, his family said. But he mixed up the address, finding himself in front of a house on Northeast 115 Street, instead of Northeast 115th Terrace.
The white man who answered the door there shot him in the head and again in the arm after he fell, according to prosecutors. Somehow, Ralph made his way, bleeding, to another nearby house. There, he was told to lie on the ground while someone called for help, his family said.
The homeowner who shot him, Andrew D. Lester, 84, was taken into custody by the police for 24 hours, then released without charges on Friday. Over the weekend, anger began to spread in the community. Protesters marched on Mr. Lester's home on Sunday, while the Kansas City police chief, Stacey Graves, acknowledged the public frustration at a news conference. The teenager was released from the hospital on Sunday evening, his father said.
As pressure mounted on Monday afternoon, the Police Department said in a statement that it had submitted the case file to the Clay County prosecuting attorney's office. The prosecutor, Zachary Thompson, publicly identified Mr. Lester a few hours later and announced that he had been charged, saying what many already believed: "There was a racial component to the case."
Mr. Thompson said Mr. Lester had been charged with assault in the first degree, a class-A felony, and could face life in prison if convicted. He also was charged with armed criminal action, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, Mr. Thompson said.
It was not clear if the teenager had knocked on Mr. Lester's door or if he rang the doorbell, but he did not "cross the threshold" into the man's home, Mr. Thompson said. The shots from a .32-caliber handgun were fired through a glass door, the prosecutor said, adding that there was no indication that "any words were exchanged."
"We understand how frustrating this has been, but I can assure you that the criminal justice system is working, and will continue to work," Mr. Thompson said.
Mr. Lester was not in custody when the charges were announced. Mr. Thompson said at the news conference that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, and that his bail had been set at $ 200,000.
"I don't have any information regarding his specific whereabouts," he added, "but it's my understanding law enforcement is aware of the situation and taking all appropriate action."
The teenager's father, Paul Yarl, said in a phone interview on Monday evening that his son underwent surgery over the weekend to remove the bullets. He was able to walk out of the hospital on Sunday evening and was expected to make a full recovery, his father said. The first bullet hit his son's forehead on the side of his face, close to the hairline, he said, and the second hit his right arm.
Mr. Yarl said that he was relieved when the charges were finally announced.
He said that he was confused that Mr. Lester had been "allowed to go home and sleep" but that his main concern was for other Black children. "He could have repeated it with the next kid that looked like Ralph," he said.
Mr. Yarl said he learned that his son had been shot in a call from the boy's mother on Friday morning and drove from his home in Indianapolis to Kansas City, where he visited his son and also joined the protest over the weekend.
"I'm still shocked. He's a good kid," he said, describing his son as an athlete who loves music and video games, and who excels in school. The parents, who are Liberian immigrants, have been divorced since 2017.
Mayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City said in an interview on Monday before the charges were announced that he was "heartbroken and angry about the situation that we find ourselves in."
"You've heard about driving while Black," said Mr. Lucas, who is Black. "You've heard about all the other issues that Black people confront in life. Can you not knock on the door while Black? It's almost like you can't exist."
Later on Monday, Mr. Lucas said on Twitter that the charges against Mr. Lester were a "first step towards justice for Ralph Yarl." He also said that he had spoken with Ralph's mother and had "shared with her my personal commitment to ensuring we find justice for her son, her family, and all hurting now in our City."
The White House said on Monday night that President Biden had spoken by phone to Ralph and that he had "shared his hope for a swift recovery."
Before the charges were announced, most of the details about the shooting had come from family members and their lawyers, Ben Crump and S. Lee Merritt, as The Kansas City Star and other local media outlets covered the growing controversy over the release of Mr. Lester, who had not yet been publicly identified.
"There can be no excuse for the release of this armed and dangerous suspect after admitting to shooting an unarmed, nonthreatening and defenseless teenager that rang his doorbell," Mr. Crump and Mr. Merritt wrote in a joint statement on Sunday.
Mr. Crump linked to a fund-raising page started by Ralph's aunt, Faith Spoonmore, who wrote that her nephew, a high school junior, did not have his phone with him when he went to get his brothers.
"He mistakenly went to the wrong house, one block away from the house where his siblings were," she wrote. She said that her nephew pulled into the driveway and rang the doorbell and that the man who came to the door shot Ralph in the head.
"My nephew fell to the ground, and the man shot him again," Ms. Spoonmore wrote. "Ralph was then able to get up and run to the neighbor's house, looking for help. Unfortunately, he had to run to three different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up."
Chief Graves said on Sunday that the police were called to the scene around 10 p.m. During the news conference, an investigator declined to say whether it was the homeowner who had called 911.
The gunman was released after being held for the maximum 24-hour period allowed without charges under state law in a felony investigation, the chief said at the news conference.
Chief Graves said that the teenager was expected to give a formal statement to investigators when his injuries allow. She also said that there was a "potential" self-defense or "stand your ground" element that investigators were examining.
But the following day, Mayor Lucas said that Missouri's Stand Your Ground law, which was adopted in 2016, should not apply in this case.
"If Stand Your Ground really lets somebody just shoot somebody that rings a doorbell," he said, "that put the life of every postal worker, every campaigner, every Amazon delivery person at risk in this country."

Despite Odds, Stock Pickers Couldn't Beat the Market: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2022, conditions were heavily in stock pickers' favor, but most trailed the market. This year looks worse, our columnist says.
It's awfully hard to beat the stock market consistently. In 2022, despite many advantages, most mutual funds couldn't do it. There are important lessons in that failure for this year and beyond.
Recall that the S&P 500 declined 19.4 percent last year. It was a miserable time for just about anyone who held stocks, including those who merely tried to match the overall market, as I do, using broadly diversified, low-cost index funds.
But beneath the market's surface last year, there were plenty of opportunities that should have given active stock pickers a competitive advantage over index funds. That's because the average stock did better than the overall market, which was heavily influenced by a relative handful of "megacap" tech stocks like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These giants declined sharply, but the rest of the market did markedly better.
That meant the odds actually favored stock pickers last year. They had plenty of companies to choose from, any one of which would have given them a better performance than the overall market. And, in fact, as a group, actively managed mutual funds fared better against the overall market average than they have since 2009.
Even so, the average actively managed stock mutual fund failed to beat the S&P 500. In an interview, Anu R. Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, summarized that mediocre performance this way. "Actively managed funds underperformed less badly in 2022 than they have in most years," she said. "But they still underperformed."
Tailwinds Helped, but Not Much
In some respects, the failure of actively managed mutual funds to beat the broad market indexes last year is unsurprising. S&P Dow Jones Indices has been running systematic comparisons of actively managed funds and passively managed funds -- a.k.a. index funds -- since 2001.
These studies have consistently found that the vast majority of active fund managers just can't beat the indexes over 10- or 20-year periods, or in most individual years, either.
From 2010 through 2021, anywhere from 55 percent to 87 percent of actively managed funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks couldn't beat that benchmark in any given year.
Compared with that, the results for 2022 were cause for celebration: About 51 percent of large-cap stock funds failed to beat the S&P 500.
Active managers couldn't quite achieve what random chance would predict -- that 50 percent of actively managed funds would beat the index.
In other words, their performance for 2022 looks slightly worse than the results of a random coin flip.
That's unimpressive, but it was much worse over longer periods. Consider these tallies for funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks through the end of 2022:
Over three years, 74.3 percent of actively managed funds trailed the index.
Over five years, 86.5 percent underperformed.
Over 10 years, 91.4 percent underperformed.
Over 20 years, 94.8 percent underperformed.
As the numbers show, the longer you ran the horse race, the more actively managed funds fell behind.
Over 20 years through April 11, the SPDR S&P 500 E.T.F. -- one of the many mutual funds and exchange-traded index funds that track the S&P 500 -- returned nearly 10 percent, annualized. The vast majority of active, stock-picking funds couldn't match that.
The Odds Have Gotten Worse
When you look carefully at the results for 2022, the performance of actively managed funds is much worse than it may seem at first glance, because it really wasn't a coin flip.
For the stock market, 2022 was a special year. If there was any year in which stock pickers should have been able to outperform the broad market indexes, 2022 was it, yet most still couldn't beat the battered stock market.
That augurs poorly for active managers in 2023 because, so far at least, the odds have shifted.
Once again, consider "megacap" tech stocks, which had terrible performances last year -- much worse than the S&P 500 as a whole. The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, which means that the most valuable stocks in the markets, like those from the big tech companies, have an outsize effect on stock market returns. When they decline, the overall index tends to decline. When they rise, the overall market tends to rise. Often the market moves in lock step, with many stocks heading in the same direction.
But last year, the monthly "dispersion" of the S&P 500, which measures "the magnitude of differences" in the returns of individual stocks in the index, was at its highest level since 2009. This means that there was more variation in stock returns, and most individual stocks did much better than the megacap stocks. You can see this by comparing the standard S&P 500 with an equal-weighted version, in which a stock like Dish Network, with a market capitalization of less than $ 5 billion, has the same weight as a colossus like Apple, with a market cap of well over $ 2 trillion.
In 2022, the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperformed the standard index by nearly seven percentage points. That implies that if you just picked stocks randomly last year, you should have done better than the overall index because the typical random stock did better than the megacaps and better than the S&P 500. But most active managers couldn't do it.
Their chances are worse this year because the market so far has been very different. Megacap stocks have been outperforming the average stock in the S&P 500 index, and the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has been trailing the standard, cap-weighted index. That implies that if you just pick stocks randomly, odds are that you will trail the overall stock market this year.
And, in fact, preliminary tallies by Bank of America show that in a horse race between active large-cap mutual fund managers and the S&P 500 this year, the active managers have been clobbered. Only 45 percent of active large-cap stock managers have matched the performance of the S&P 500. Stock pickers are doing better in some corners of the market, but for the most part, it's a dismal picture
Improving Your Chances
It's definitely possible to beat the stock market. A small number of people will probably to do it over the next 20 years. But I don't know now who those outliers will be. Similarly, I don't know the precise direction of the economy or of inflation or of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies or of a host of other monumentally important factors. No one else knows, either.
That's why I think it makes sense to embrace humility, accept my limitations and use low-cost index funds to try to match the returns of the stock and bond markets over the long run.
To do that, and to withstand the wrenching shifts in the markets that will surely come, I'll need enough cash on hand to pay the bills first. Money-market funds and high-yield, federally insured savings accounts and certificates of deposit are reasonable options for that purpose.
Make your own choice. Some active stock pickers will beat the market averages this year. But based on history, I think it's virtually certain that the vast majority won't manage to do it over the next 20 years.
Because I'm trying to improve my odds while investing for the long haul, I'm aiming for an absolutely average performance.

Full text: Just about everyone has somewhere special they went when young, a place that glows in memory. For some it may be a library or game arcade, for others a baseball field or bookstore. For Jay Carlson, growing up in western Massachusetts in the early 1990s, the center of the universe was the video rental store.
This was before streaming, before Netflix, before DVDs. The videocassette player was the summit of consumer technology. At the rental shop, 12-year-old Jay would bump into friends and neighbors, hear about something that couldn't be missed, talk up his own favorites. It was like social media before social media was invented.
He grew up, got married, had children, went to work in the finance department of a retailer. Technology moved on, but his heart did not. One day, he saw in his local comics store a tape of "Ghostbusters," the first movie his parents let him pick out himself. It was $ 7, still sealed from the factory.
"I said to my wife, 'I think I might start collecting tapes,"' Mr. Carlson, 43, said. "I was taking a piece of my childhood back."
Many others are, too. The stock market, real estate and cryptocurrencies did poorly in 2022, but the global luxury goods market grew 20 percent. People may have had less, but they spent more on fine arts and collectibles that serve no function except to provide pleasure.
The culture is bursting with new material -- every day, thousands of new books are published and 100,000 new songs are released on Spotify -- but the old stuff offers a sweeter emotional payoff for many. It could be tapes or posters or pictures or comics or coins or sports cards or memorabilia. It might be from their childhood or the childhood they never had, or it might merely express a longing to be anywhere but 2023.
The common element is this: People like to own a thing from a thing they love. For Mr. Carlson and millions like him, the nostalgia factory is working overtime.
When Mr. Carlson first began to look for sealed VHS cassettes, they were considered so much plastic trash. "Back to the Future," "The Goonies," "Blade Runner," were about $ 20 each on eBay. He put them on a shelf, little windows into his past, and started an Instagram account called Rare and Sealed.
Then tapes began to get scarcer and much more expensive. People trapped at home had lots of money to spend during the pandemic. But it was more than that.
Objects with a bit of history have an obvious attraction in a high-tech world. The current cultural tumult, with its boom in fake images, endless arguments over everything and now the debut of imperious A.I. chatbots, increases the appeal of things that can't be plugged in.
At the same time, advances in technology mean it is ever easier to buy expensive things online. Bids at auctions routinely reach tens, even hundreds, of thousands of dollars.
One thing people are eagerly seeking with the new technology is old technology. Cormac McCarthy's typewriter, which he used to write a shelf of important novels, went for a quarter-million dollars. An Apple 1 computer fetched nearly twice that. A first-generation iPhone, still sealed in its box, sold for $ 21,000 in December and triple that in February.
Blend these factors -- a desire for escape from our virtual lives; bidding as fast as pushing a button; and the promotion of new collecting fields like outdated technology devices -- and you have Heritage Auctions in Dallas.
Heritage is a whirlwind of activity, of passion, of hype, constantly trying new ways of enticing people to own something beautiful and useless. Ninety-one million Americans, according to U.S. Census Bureau surveys, are having trouble paying household bills. Everyone else is a potential bidder.
"There was a point in time when art and collectibles were dominated by old white men," said Josh Benesh, Heritage's chief strategy officer. "I think that has been democratized. And the categories of material for sale have been democratized a lot."
Twenty years ago, Heritage had four categories: coins, comics, movie posters and sports. Now it has more than 50, which generated revenue of $ 1.4 billion last year. Everything, at least in theory, is collectible.
"We don't question the value or legitimacy of a particular subject matter relative to outmoded norms," Mr. Benesh said. "We're not here to tell you what's worthwhile. The marketplace will tell you. The bidders" -- Heritage has 1.6 million -- "will tell you."
VHS tapes were apparently worthwhile. The selection of an expert to run the sales was easy: Mr. Carlson. His first auction, in June 2022, brought in more than a half-million dollars.
The publicity around the sale brought Mr. Carlson, whose email address is on the Heritage website, many offers of tapes. One man said he had put together a time capsule for his son, who was born on Christmas Day 1982. "Rocky III" had just come out, so the father included a brand-new copy. He threw in "Rocky I" and "Rocky II" as well. They'd cost $ 60 each.
The three tapes, all with a factory seal, fetched $ 53,750 in a February auction.
Since cassettes were designed to be played, only a few unopened ones exist 40 years later. But since they were never considered valuable, they might be found anywhere for a pittance.
"A man told us he found a sealed first release of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' at Goodwill," Mr. Carlson said. "He paid a quarter. That will probably go for $ 20,000."
Every potential bidder must decide if this is the 2023 equivalent of Beanie Babies, which flew high and then crashed. Mr. Carlson would not be working at Heritage if he didn't believe.
"These tapes are historical artifacts that have this ability to sweep you back in time to a place that all at once feels miles away and yet somehow like home," he said. "I used to think it was just me, but I talk to more and more people getting into this because of that pull."
The pull of nostalgia is powerful indeed. But the pull of quick cash can be more powerful still. There were 235 lots in February's tape auction, and they all sold.
For those who missed out, dozens of the lots are now highlighted on Heritage's website to suggest the owner might be willing to flip his newly acquired copy of "Caddyshack" for a 50 percent premium.
At Heritage, the bidding never really ends.
Wanted Dead or Alive
The Heritage offices look like a cross between an Amazon warehouse and a very wide-ranging museum, with a dash of "Hoarders" thrown in.
In mid-2020, the privately held company moved to a 160,000-square-foot building by Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, doubling the size of its former headquarters. Hundreds of specialists, most of them collectors themselves, prepare hundreds of thousands of items for bids here -- researching, photographing, writing catalog copy.
There are boxes of Teenage Mutant Turtles Killer Bee toys. A CBS television camera that filmed the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald. A poster from the McKinley campaign in 1896. Lots of Pokémon. Fake newspapers from the HBO series "Watchmen." Lots and lots of comic books. A videocassette of the horror flick "Death Spa." Sneakers. Trading cards.
Stuff overwhelms desks; objects are piled to the ceilings in storage rooms; racks are full of items that have been bought and must be shipped.
The spiritual roots of Heritage, which calls itself "America's auction house," go back to the most primitive type of collector, the souvenir hunter. Anything not nailed down in America, along with quite a bit that is, becomes prey. Traveling through Missouri in 1882, Oscar Wilde noticed a crowd pulling down a little yellow house.
"It is the house of the great train-robber and murderer, Jesse James, who was shot by his pal last week, and the people are relic hunters," the playwright reported. "They sold his dustbin and foot-scraper yesterday at public auction, his door-knocker is to be offered for sale this afternoon, the reserve price being about the income of an English bishop."
Wilde added that Americans "are great hero-worshippers, and always take their heroes from the criminal classes." That's as true as ever. A few months ago, Heritage sold the outlaw's pocket revolver for $ 62,500.
The problem is, older historical items that were previously unknown are becoming rare. Every barn, basement and attic has been ransacked for treasures. New items related to Washington or Lincoln, for instance, are nearly impossible to find.
"All the varieties of Lincoln inaugural buttons seem to be known," said Curtis Lindner, Heritage's director of Americana. "There has not been a new photo of Lincoln in many years. We get a lot of people saying, 'I have a new image.' Unfortunately, not everyone who has a beard is Abraham Lincoln."
So the pressure is on to develop new material. For instance, Vegas casino chips. "People have emotional ties to Vegas," said Ray Farina, who moved over from Americana to develop this niche. "Maybe they saw Elvis there back in the day."
A 1953 chip from the fabled Sands casino sold for $ 12,000 at Heritage in December. Now people with chips are contacting Heritage. A guy says his father worked for the casinos taking the decommissioned chips out to the desert to bury them in concrete. Apparently, he kept some.
"Word gets out," Mr. Farina said. "We have tremendous marketing ability here."
The pace of Heritage's auctions is relentless -- there were 1,034 in 2022, almost three a day, with a total of 412,270 lots -- and so are the Heritage emails promoting them.
Even so, revenue barely inched up in 2022 after growing 60 percent in 2021. The number of registered bidders rose, but only by a small fraction. There may be a limit to what marketing can do.
Looking for a Sure Thing
Sitting in his office on a rainy Monday morning, Chris Ivy, the director of sports auctions at Heritage, is a bit distracted. That's because he is talking about auctions while simultaneously bidding for Heritage on a Michael Jordan jersey being auctioned by a competitor.
Last summer, Heritage sold a Mickey Mantle rookie card for $ 12.6 million, which it billed as the most valuable sports collectible ever sold at auction. The clothing actually worn by players seems to Mr. Ivy undervalued by comparison.
He suspects this Jordan jersey, which is being sold as nothing special, was worn in a game. "It has a downside of maybe $ 5,000 and an upside of $ 100,000. I'll take that every day of the week," he says. "We use our expertise here to help generate income."
Mr. Ivy wins the jersey for about $ 20,000. To try to authenticate it, he will use a photo-matching service, which will scour the internet for proof that it is what he thinks it is. When a historical object is validated with contemporary images, bidders are encouraged.
A recent Heritage auction featured a 1948 Joe DiMaggio jersey. What made it special was the black armband attached to the left sleeve, a tribute to Babe Ruth after his death on Aug. 16 of that year. The Yankees' two greatest stars were thus linked for a few weeks.
The jersey was being sold by a collector, and there was no direct connection to DiMaggio. So Heritage sent photographs of it to Resolution Photomatching in Seattle.
Resolution found a contemporary picture that showed DiMaggio apparently wearing the shirt, although without the mourning band. The tiny imperfections in the flannel were the same. The jersey sold for $ 564,000.
Data can mislead as well as illuminate. Two years ago, an Australian gamer named Karl Jobst released a popular video that made allegations of fraud against Heritage. The company responded that it "has always acted with the utmost integrity and has never falsely inflated the collector video-game marketplace or any other."
At the heart of the accusations is the question of grading. In the 1980s, ratings companies began offering numerical scores for coins at auction. In theory, that meant bidders knew exactly what they were getting without having to examine each lot personally.
Ratings accelerated the development of online auctions, with the practice spreading to sports cards, comic books and, more recently, game cartridges and videotapes. After grading, items are inserted into a hard plastic case to prevent wear. Just like a photo-match, a high grade reassures potential bidders that the object is, indeed, something special.
Then came the Super Mario Bros. game cartridge auctions.
Super Mario is a Nintendo game introduced in the mid-1980s that became a global phenomenon and, this month, a new Hollywood movie. In 2017, an unrated copy of the original game brought in $ 30,000 on eBay, prompting shock and disbelief. Two years later, a cartridge graded 9.4 sold for $ 100,000 to a group that included Jim Halperin, a founder of Heritage. The purchase was used by Heritage to promote its new auction of graded games.
In the summer of 2021, Heritage auctioned a Super Mario cartridge for $ 1.56 million, a tenfold increase in two years and the first game to be sold at auction for more than $ 1 million. It had a grade of 9.8 and was rated A++. The sale made news. In the same auction, a Super Mario was graded at 8.5 and rated A+. It sold for only $ 31,000.
Valarie Spiegel, who oversees video games at Heritage, explained the $ 1.5 million difference: "9.8 is a trophy-level grade," whereas "8.5 is not." Keep in mind this is not about the game itself but, in essence, the tightness of the plastic seal.
Grading, Mr. Jobst points out, is "very subjective by nature." When dealers and collectors get a grade that they think is too low, they simply crack open the plastic case and send the item back to the grading company or a competitor. This is known as "the crack-out game."
Forbes magazine accused Mr. Halperin of doing this with coins in 2004, creating a sort of grade inflation that pushed up prices for unwary bidders. In a lengthy rebuttal that is still on the Heritage website, Mr. Halperin said he publicly encouraged crack-outs by anyone who got a grade they thought too low.
"We sell an item as if it were our own," Mr. Ivy said. "Our question always is, How can we maximize this? The more we get for our consignors, the more money we make."
The Nostalgia Vault
The thrill of a collection is that it is real -- you can take it off the shelf. This is also, of course, the problem with collecting. Collections can easily overwhelm a house, a life.
Several online auction companies have recently announced programs to take care of collections for their owners. Collecting, which gained so much momentum as a response to the virtual, is moving away from its physical reality.
A program being tested at eBay uses a vault in Delaware to store sports cards. Collectors cannot visit their treasures, but eBay will take a photograph of the card and send it to the owner, kind of like seeing your child at summer camp. Beckett, a sports collectible company, has opened a 100,000-square-foot vault in Plano, Texas.
Mr. Carlson, the videocassette expert, is not so sure he would want to use a vault. He likes seeing his tapes too much. In any case, his collection is not growing much these days. He's wrapped up in his job at Heritage. And then there's the problem of money, or lack of it.
"Some of the tapes I like go beyond my budget," he said.

Is That a TV on the Dashboard?: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As luxury cars become rolling supercomputers, designers are wondering how big is too big.
From pocket-stretching smartphones to wall-hogging TVs, Americans have often asked: How much screen is too much?
The question has come to today's gadget-stuffed cars, whose increasingly colossal screens are splitting opinions among designers, car buyers and industry critics. These do-it-all touch screens, the nerve centers of many new cars, have sparked a backlash because of their size, as well as the clunky interfaces that may take eyes off the road.
"I think we've reached Peak Screen," said Klaus Busse, Maserati's head of design, who previously led design for Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia. "Screens have their right of existence -- they do a lot of things better than physical switches. It's just been pushed a little too far."
Beyond having ergonomic and safety concerns, some luxury designers object on aesthetic grounds. To them, screens just aren't sexy or luxurious.
"When flat screens showed up, the-bigger-the-better was the trend," said Kai Langer, head of design for BMW i, the automaker's electric division. "But 'bigger' isn't always the richest."
Screens are now integral to most modern cars, which are more or less rolling supercomputers, running up to 14 times more code than a Boeing 787. And designers must keep in mind the demands of car owners who expect that their Apple or Android smartphones will hook up flawlessly.
"Steve Jobs changed the world, and now mankind touches a screen," said Gorden Wagener, the chief designer for Mercedes-Benz. "That fundamentally changes the car as well. The car needs a good interface, not just a wiper switch and turn indicator."
When Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Model S in 2009, the command center, with its 17-inch LCD touch screen, seemed nearly as game-changing as the car itself. And in giving drivers digital control of automotive functions, Tesla was able to avoid the expense of engineering, wiring and building a cabin full of pricey analog switches, knobs and gauges -- or having to buy them from another automaker or supplier.
In Tesla's bare-bones Model 3 and Model Y especially, one might suspect that interior designers worked overtime on their ingenious screens and then called it a day. A number of Tesla's competitors mimicked the cabins' austere, vaguely sci-fi vibe.
The creators of later electric vehicles -- including BMW's futuristic yet sumptuous iX and the Kia EV6 -- came up with warmer car interiors better suited to drivers who may not want to feel as if they are spending hours inside the mainframe from "Tron." Some designers are even ditching that most played-out of E.V. tropes, the Mac-like monochromes of gray-silver-white.
With its expanded touch screen, Tesla also spurred an arms race measured in inches. Ford stuffed a 15.5-inch screen into its Mustang Mach-e and F-150 Lightning E.V.s. The start-up Rivian has installed a 16-inch display in the R1T and R1S models. Another California company, Lucid, created a 34-inch, curved-glass screen for the Air sedan.
And then there is the "Hyperscreen," from Mercedes-Benz.
Powered by eight processors, framed under a sculptural slab of double-coated glass, the Hyperscreen (actually three screens that appear as one) spreads 56 inches of digital interface across the dashboard. Augmented-reality navigation generates virtual street signs and directional guides over the pavement in a real-time camera view. Almost magically, virtual address numbers hover over homes and businesses as you approach a destination.
Yet the Hyperscreen doesn't always work as elegantly as it looks -- especially when drivers are, well, driving. Issues include fussy thumb-pad controls on the steering wheel and moments of hair-pulling confusion, especially for customers who grew up with predigital rides. Mr. Wagener said that Mercedes intentionally launched its Hyperscreen in its electric vehicles to aim it at tech-savvy customers.
BMW is no stranger to screens, having ushered in iDrive more than 20 years ago on the 7-Series sedan. That digital operating system, with a now-quaint 6.5-inch screen atop the dashboard, infuriated many drivers because it was so hard to use. But as BMW refined it over the years, rival car companies adopted similar systems.
The i7 sedan, a new electric model from BMW, wraps a curved screen around the driver. The back of the car offers a 31-inch, fold-down theater touch screen, with 5G connectivity and Amazon Fire for streaming. Another 5.5-inch screen nestles into each rear armrest.
At the annual CES in Las Vegas in January, BMW threw down that gauntlet by going well beyond the touch screen. In the iVision Dee, a concept sedan that previews a range of BMW "Neue Klasse" E.V.s -- the first scheduled to arrive in 2025 -- the windshield itself takes the place of a dashboard touch screen.
"Let's use the biggest display we already have in a car, which is the windshield," Mr. Langer, the BMW design chief, said.
The augmented-reality windshield allows for "Minority Report"-style projections of traditional gauges (speedometer; temperature settings; audio displays) and social-and-streaming content. The system, which BMW will call Panoramic Vision on showroom models, greatly expands the head-up displays that project content into the field of view, allowing drivers to check the controls without looking away from the road.
For those leery of astral projections blocking their view of I-95, Mr. Langer said that drivers could choose any display level. A "mixed reality slider" can limit traditional information, such as a speedometer, to a thin strip of lower windshield, where today's head-up displays already operate. Drivers more at ease with digital projections can fill more of the windshield glass with content. When the car isn't moving, including during charging stops, passengers may eventually use the entire windshield like a virtual drive-in for movies, games, Zoom meetings or trips to the metaverse.
At the convention in Las Vegas, the BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said he was convinced that regulators would eventually ban large dashboard screens because of safety concerns. "If you have to look down to operate your car, we think it's a big mistake," he told Automotive News Europe.
Mr. Langer noted that prominent screens do not appear in the pages of high-end shelter or architectural magazines. "None of our consumers would want to cover their living room in screens," he said. "They want their Eames chair or Nelson clock. And we want our customers to feel at home."
And if touch screens shrink or even disappear from cars' cabins, designers will be free to reclaim the interiors for something more aesthetically pleasing. "A touch screen doesn't speak to our senses," Mr. Langer said. "We're made to touch fabrics and sense different surfaces; that's what makes us human."
Some of the iVision Dee's fanciful tech -- including a chameleon-like body that can instantly change to one of 32 colors -- may be ditched or watered down in production versions. Yet BMW vows the panoramic display is bound for showrooms.
Mercedes-Benz is skeptical. While it offers head-up displays, it is convinced that windshield projections "are light-years behind the quality and resolution you can achieve on a screen," Mr. Wagener said.
"It's certainly an innovative approach," he continued. "But we've tried it, and it's disturbing or disorienting to have all that in your viewing area."
Maserati is steering a middle course with its GranTurismo. Its interior includes a pair of screens that don't draw attention to themselves.
"We don't want a screen to be the main protagonist," Mr. Busse, the Maserati design chief, said.
In his view, the car is a refuge from the digital world and its pressures.
"For us," he said, "it's still about the driving experience -- to enjoy this beautiful machine and the countryside where you're operating it."

Inside the Hope-Filled Pods of 'Love Is Blind': [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- Peahens choose peacocks with more elaborate feathers, earthworms mate based on size, and baboons judge on hierarchy, but humans, as more intellectually evolved creatures, have been socialized instead to seek out love.
For a tiny subset of the species, this mating ritual involves 10 days on a television set in Greater Los Angeles, where participants sit alone in 12-by-14-foot rooms listening to the disembodied voices of potential mates discuss such topics as their ideal number of offspring.
That is the basis for "Love Is Blind," the voyeuristic Netflix reality series built around buzzwords, booze and mild sensory deprivation that released its Season 4 finale on Friday and is set to air a live reunion special on Sunday. On the show, 30 singles sign up to date each other, separated inside these rooms -- known as "pods" -- with their conversations fed through speakers. They don't see whom they're talking to until they decide to get engaged -- a commitment that also comes with a hastily arranged wedding where they can say "I do" or walk away.
If it all sounds rushed, chaotic, a bit unhinged, the show's creator, Chris Coelen, understands. Brandon Riegg, the Netflix executive who greenlighted the pitch about five years ago, described the idea with a synonym for bat guano, and he recalled telling Coelen that he would be lucky to get even one couple out of it.
Despite the naysayers, Coelen felt confident that people would get engaged. After all, contestants on his show "Married at First Sight" had been marrying strangers for years.
"People want to find love," he said in an interview last month on the "Love Is Blind" set, where production was beginning on a new season, "and they're willing to do some pretty wild things to find it."
The show premiered in February 2020, taking off as viewers were adjusting to their own versions of pandemic-mandated pod life, and has continued to captivate audiences. More than 30 million Netflix subscribers watched during the first four weeks after its premiere, the company reported, and Season 4, which kicked off in March, topped the previous seasons' opening weekends by hours watched. Last year, according to Nielsen, "Love Is Blind" was the eighth most-watched original streaming series in the United States, ahead of "The Crown" and the "Lord of the Rings" spinoff "The Rings of Power." Versions of the show based in Japan and Brazil have already been released, with U.K. and Swedish adaptations in the works.
Kim Kardashian, Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Daniel Radcliffe are among the show's celebrity fans, and contestants have built gigantic social media followings, with one married participant from Season 1, Lauren Speed-Hamilton, reaching 2.5 million followers on Instagram. The series has also fueled cottage industries on TikTok of amateur detectives digging into the contestants' back stories and of therapists analyzing the relationship dynamics onscreen. At times, "Love Is Blind" has prompted musings on our fraying social fabric, with commentators declaring that the show "speaks to the state of modern romance" and "holds a mirror to a reality we'd rather ignore."
For Netflix, its appeal was more fundamental. It matched the streamer's ethos around unscripted programming, Riegg said: relatable and optimistic.
"If you look at some of the most beloved and established unscripted franchises, they've been running for a very long time," he added. "And I don't think there's any reason that ours can't do the same."
'Whatever happens, happens.'
So how did "Love Is Blind," with its absurd conceit, manage to position itself as the closest thing to "The Bachelor" for the cable-less generation?
Coelen said it's because the show puts it all out there, revealing contestants' explosive dramatics and romantic indifference without coaxing anything out of them.
Producers have included footage of one participant, Andrew Liu, appearing to apply eye drops to simulate tears for the camera after he was dumped in Season 3. One couple in the current season had enough of each other and split before they got to the altar. And when Shake Chatterjee, from Season 2, tried to suss out what his dates looked like by asking if he could feasibly carry them on his shoulders, the producers said they never considered intervening.
The hosts are a married couple, Vanessa and Nick Lachey -- the latter of whom was the subject of his own early-aughts reality series when he married Jessica Simpson. They rarely interact with participants, occasionally dropping in during the season and serving as therapist-like mediators during the reunions.
"We just watch. We involve ourselves in nothing," said Ally Simpson (no relation to Jessica), one of the show's executive producers. During production, she sits next to Coelen in the control room, where they monitor as many as 10 dates happening simultaneously.
But the concept of authenticity gets complicated when the location for the dates is a 68,000-square-foot studio next to an Amazon warehouse, where dozens of crew members zip around with walkie talkies and 81 cameras pan and zoom to catch every blush and giggle. (Contestants stay in hotels overnight, though the napping and cooking can sometimes make it appear as though they're living on set à la "The Real World.")
Inside the two single-sex lounges where the singles congregate, the plants are plastic, a digital fire roars onscreen, and those metallic goblets that have become the show's mascots are adhered to the shelves so that guests don't knock them over.
When Kwame Appiah, a tech worker who appears on the current season, says of a woman he has never seen, "I've just been smitten for a really long time," he means six days.
Then there's the influencer industrial complex. In the three years since the show's debut, cast members with new followings have promoted Smirnoff Spicy Tamarind vodka, Bud Light hard seltzer and Fenty lipstick, as well as yogurt and laxatives.
When it comes to choosing a cast, the producers say they try to weed out those seeking social media fame or joining on a whim, but if such types slip into the roster, Coelen said, he believes they still tend to become invested in the process.
"We build the machinery, and whatever happens, happens," he said.
The machinery starts with Donna Driscoll, the show's head of casting, who has been with Coelen's production company, Kinetic Content, since the second season of "Married at First Sight." Interested singles apply online, but Driscoll's team also seeks people out on social media and at bars, grocery stores and church groups.
A third-party company conducts background checks and psychological evaluations, and the casting team creates what are called "compatibility grids," a spreadsheet listing key characteristics, including the desire to have children. They are effectively trying to "stack the deck," Coelen said, so that each person comes in with some compatibility, at least on paper, with others. (If love really is blind, it is also heavily vetted.)
On the show, the contestants describe being at their wits' end with dating norms of the 2020s, which tend to involve more swiping on touchscreens than IRL spontaneity.
"My parents are like, 'Why don't you just go meet a guy at a bar?"' said Chelsea Griffin, a speech-language pathologist from Seattle who is on the current season. "Who does that anymore?"
Instead, with her phone confiscated, she met a guy at a production facility where a maze of dark hallways leads to pods and to a room where contestants sit for one-on-one interviews with a blurred backdrop positioned behind them.
At the start of filming, budding romances begin with 10-minute speed dates, lengthening each day until the most lovestruck couples chat for hours, sometimes lingering until 3 a.m.
"The rate at which you go in this experience, it's hard for my mom to fathom. It's hard for my brother to fathom," Griffin said. "I could sit and try to articulate and explain the entire thing, and people still wouldn't get it."
Members of the production team listen on headsets, logging moments like when someone says "I love you" or tears flow. They move contestant headshots around a bulletin board as they pair off and break up, like detectives on a crime procedural.
At the end of the day, the contestants rank their dates on paper. The team then uses a variation on a Nobel Prize-winning algorithm, created by two mathematicians in the 1960s, to find a dating schedule in which everyone has matches. For the first four seasons, Simpson and Coelen organized the data by hand to determine the next day's lineup of dates, but more recently, Simpson plugs the rankings into computer software.
By day seven, the men are able to pick out engagement rings provided by the show. By day nine, after couples have typically spent about 30 total hours dating -- albeit in separate rooms -- some of them pop the question. If the answer is a yes, they finally meet.
Then, it's time to plan the wedding. Singles have been choosing among suitors they couldn't see as far back as the 1960s (see "The Dating Game"), but "Love Is Blind" makes marriage its clear, televised conclusion.
"You think about reality shows as being these zany, deviant enterprises, but when it comes right down to it, they promulgate some of our most conservative values," said Danielle Lindemann, a sociologist who wrote a book about reality television. "Ultimately, this show is about heterosexual coupling that ends in marriage."
Success, and scrutiny
The inherent limits of the show have opened it to critique. Though "Love Is Blind" might be more diverse than some reality shows in terms of race and body type, those selected for the "experiment" tend to be conventionally attractive heterosexual men and women in their 20s and 30s.
Speed-Hamilton, who has gone on to co-host a podcast for Netflix about its reality series, accused the show last season of "cutting all the Black women" after the pods portion, adding that most of the couples seemed "forced" and only established "for entertainment purposes."
There have been other musings that this season of the show is falling into typical reality TV traps, zooming in on "mean girl" drama and casting people whose true intentions some viewers question. There have also been suggestions that the show has edited footage to ramp up the drama. Jackelina Bonds, a dental assistant from this season, wrote on Instagram that footage had been reordered so that it appears she went on a date before she broke up with her fiancé, when in fact, the date was afterward.
Coelen said the production team works to portray the "accurate essence of each person's journey." He said the show focuses on building a diverse pool of participants from the start and chooses to follow the engagements that seem most genuine. Any "mean girl" behavior happened without their influence, he said.
One of the most vocal skeptics of the show's authenticity has been a former contestant, Jeremy Hartwell, who was not closely followed during his season. He filed a class-action lawsuit last year against Netflix and Kinetic Content, saying that the defendants cut off the cast from the outside world, plied them with unlimited alcohol and withheld food and sleep with the objective of leading the cast to make "manipulated decisions for the benefit of the show's entertainment value."
The crux of the lawsuit was an objection to the show's payment structure at the time, which, the complaint said, involved a $ 1,000 stipend per filming week with a maximum of $ 8,000 in possible earnings. His lawsuit argued that the participants had been "willfully misclassified" as independent contractors rather than as employees who were entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay and various labor protections.
Chantal McCoy Payton, a lawyer for Hartwell, declined to comment, citing the continuing litigation.
Lawyers for Kinetic Content, which has said that the claims are without merit, asserted in court documents that Hartwell had been part of the show for only six days and did not qualify as an employee. Netflix lawyers argued that Hartwell had brought forward "extreme allegations" because he was "upset" about not being chosen by another contestant.
Coelen declined to discuss the lawsuit, but his description of the show's process was at odds with Hartwell's claims.
Daters are provided meals and can order food to the pods, he said, and while the alcohol supply is ample (the fridge in the lounge is stocked with champagne, beer, wine and hard seltzer), everyone decides for themselves whether they want to drink. There are two psychologists on the set, he noted, and the show offers to cover postproduction therapy for participants.
Although the producers say they don't interfere in relationships, Coelen, who is 54 and has been married for 16 years, said that they do suggest that the couples talk about important subjects like finances, parenting and religion, comparing the producers' level of influence to Pre-Cana, a course for couples preparing to be married by the Roman Catholic Church. For instance, in Season 1, production team members encouraged one participant, Amber Pike, to tell her fiancé, Matt Barnett, that she had about $ 20,000 in student debt. The conversation did not go particularly well, but the pair got married anyway.
"We really get invested in these relationships," said Simpson, 45, who has been married for six years.
Coelen has tried to sell similarly gimmicky dating shows before. In 2017, his production company released an American version of a show called "Kiss Bang Love" in which singles met each other by kissing blindfolded. In "The Spouse House," 14 singles bent on marriage moved in together. Both shows lasted only one season.
With "Love Is Blind," the numbers are starting to add up. From the first three seasons of the show, 17 couples came out of the pods engaged, six got legally married on the show, and four are still together.
In an interview last month, Brett Brown, a design director at Nike who got married in the episode released on Friday, said it is those early successes that keep viewers watching, curious to find out if this bizarre dating formula can spit out happy couples.
Brown acknowledged that some participants might exaggerate their feelings in exchange for the global attention that comes with being a reality TV star.
But not him.
"I can only speak from my experience," he said, "and I know that I was there for the right reason."

17 Moments in Culture That Put Their Stamp On the Covid Era: [Sunday Review Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nine days after the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic, "Tiger King" premiered. The outsize success of this Netflix docuseries about a zoo keeper nicknamed Joe Exotic, watched by over 34 million people in its first 10 days, had nothing expressly to do with Covid. But it had everything to do with the jarring change in our collective circumstances -- whether it was a need to escape our circumscribed lives or the longing, in our isolation, to do something, anything, together. It's been three years now. Covid is still with us, but it's different. In this time of relative calm, it's possible to see the pandemic as not just a crisis of public health but also a distinct cultural era with its own emerging canon. What unites these shows, movies, books and songs is not a common aesthetic or shared themes. What unites them is us -- the audience -- and the way we reacted to them: the surprising way they expanded our lives, assuaged our anxieties, lessened our isolation or just got us briefly out of our own heads. We asked an array of cultural critics to consider the following 17 artifacts, each of which captured something essential during Covid. These works reflected a tumultuous moment back at us, illuminating it and us, too. If you were putting together a time capsule to let people in 100 years know what living through this pandemic felt like, sure, you might include hand sanitizer and a surgical mask. But you must also include the theme song from "The White Lotus" and an episode of "Love Is Blind" and a group chat about Taylor Swift, as well as the unexpected online drawing lessons from a famous children's book author. As that author, Mo Willems, says in these pages of the pandemic: "Science will get us out of this, but art will get us through it." These are the cultural moments that got us through it.
The Intimate Masterpiece TAYLOR SWIFT'S 'FOLKLORE' If the first months of what we now casually refer to as "quarantine" were defined by fear and uncertainty, by July 2020 we'd entered the monotony era. In many states, movie theaters were still closed, concert venues hadn't reopened, and indoor gatherings were mostly verboten. That's when Taylor Swift's "Folklore" dropped -- the first of the three original albums she released from 2020 to 2023. Countless group chats praised its melodies and dissected its lyrics. Just when we craved closeness the most, Ms. Swift's vocals, recorded in her bedroom, felt unprecedentedly intimate. If her previous albums were made for pop maximalism, "Folklore" sounded so stripped down that you could literally hear her breathe. "Folklore" arrived like a gift that only a pop superstar could give us: an album we couldn't stop talking about at exactly the moment we needed something to obsess over together and help us mark the difference between days. -- ELAMIN ABDELMAHMOUD The Isolation Aphrodisiac 'LOVE IS BLIND' On Netflix's unscripted and addictive dating show "Love Is Blind," the singles seeking mates can't see one another -- they communicate solely from "pods" that are separated by opaque screens. So if you want to get a glimpse of the stranger you've convinced yourself is your true love, one of you must first propose marriage and the other must accept. The show premiered a month before Covid shutdowns, on Feb. 13, 2020. During a subsequent time so lonely that some people resorted to holding a birthday party for the dishwasher, living in pods and forming emotional bonds with people you've never met in person (and have maybe never even seen) suddenly felt totally normal and relatable. Perhaps marital commitment to a virtual stranger no longer seemed like such an insane price to pay for the chance to see another human face. -- TARA ARIANO The Paranoia Safe Space AMONG US While we were trapped at home, kids, gamers, streamers and at least two sitting congressional representatives chose to be trapped together in the depths of outer space. (The representatives were Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, who played Among Us online to raise awareness about getting out the vote.) In this game, you work as a group trying to complete small tasks like connecting colored wires -- but a few of you are secretly assassins, charged with discreetly killing your crewmates while they try to indiscreetly ferret you out. Among Us offered the usual thrills of a party game but with the added pandemic enticement of controlled chaos as the outside world was spiraling. Players knew their assigned roles -- and also knew that any stresses from the whodunit would evaporate at the end of each gaming session. You could play the villain (or catch one), then log off, enjoying an escape valve that the real world wasn't offering. -- ROLLIN HU The Jokes That Wrecked Us BO BURNHAM'S 'INSIDE' Some of the most memorable cultural moments in the pandemic were comedy specials -- those exemplars of artificial intimacy, when it's just a comedian, a stage, a microphone, a crowd, a camera, and you at home, hopefully laughing. Jerrod Carmichael set a new standard for intimacies, as he revealed, in a Greenwich Village jazz club, both a despised first name (Rothaniel, also the name of the special) and a sexual orientation (gay) that he had kept hidden all his life. But only one special truly captured how living through the pandemic felt: "Inside," by Bo Burnham. As a comedian, Mr. Burnham has long plumbed the inauthenticity of public performance and the neediness of online life, which made him perhaps the perfect bard for a pandemic lockdown, should one ever occur. And one did, and he was. Shot and performed alone in his Los Angeles guest house over many months, with his increasingly scraggly Robinson Crusoe beard as a testament to his unraveling sanity, "Inside" traces a 90-minute journey from entertaining ditties like "FaceTime With My Mom (Tonight)" to ragged paeans of despair like "Welcome to the Internet." It appeared on Netflix in 2021 like a message in a bottle from a shipwrecked man, except when we got it, we were all shipwrecked, too. And by the end of it, we were wrecked in other ways: In "That Funny Feeling," a comedy song about active shooters, mass isolation and climate catastrophe, when Mr. Burnham sings, "That unapparent summer air in early fall / The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all," it's probably not the punchline we hoped for, but it's definitely the one we needed to hear. -- ADAM STERNBERGH The Eerily Prescient Novel LING MA'S 'SEVERANCE' In Ling Ma's apocalyptic novel "Severance," a virus called Shen Fever ravages the world, turning people into automatons trapped in repetitive loops of behavior, producing an unnerving, slow-motion apocalypse. The book earned critical praise upon its release in 2018, when a pandemic was just a literary device. A year and a half later, when the real world plunged into a real pandemic, "Severance" became one of the fictions of disaster -- along with "Station Eleven" and the film "Contagion" -- that anxious, bewildered audiences flocked to. The main character in Ms. Ma's novel, Candace Chen, is the last blogger standing in New York, and she experiences the apocalypse as something consumable and viewable online: For her, pixels act like a shield. In early 2020, many of us felt a lot like Candace, with a plague unfurling around the world while we sat tucked away at home behind our little screens. "Severance," so unsettling on first reading, became an unlikely balm -- offering the soothing experience of hunkering down with an alternate, controllable version of catastrophe, even as a real one raged outside. -- HILLARY KELLY The Protest Soundtrack POP SMOKE'S 'DIOR' Even before Covid, the sound of Pop Smoke -- the Brooklyn-based rapper, born Bashar Barakah, who was killed in February 2020 at age 20 -- had come to represent the creativity and confrontational nature of New York. For my money, "Dior," from his breakout 2019 mixtape "Meet the Woo," is the song that exemplified his mentality and his appeal. In the summer of 2020, "Dior" became something else, too -- an anthem for the combustible, furious season of protest that followed the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a song lawless and full of raw power. The opening exhortation to "roll another one" sounds like an order from a supreme commander or the voice of a polar bear raised in Canarsie. It hits like a call to action, even as Smoke's growl stops you dead in your tracks. There were other songs that echoed over the Black Lives Matter protests -- like "We Paid" by Lil Baby featuring 42 Dugg and the protest chorus "Alright" by Kendrick Lamar -- but "Dior" is the one that lingers. Just like Smoke's unmatchable voice and authoritative flow, the carry-over effects of that first pandemic summer -- too much policing, too few social services, injustice and tenuous mental health -- persist. So "Dior" sounds more essential than ever: a song you can play at a block party and at a protest where you're fighting for your right to live. -- JAYSON BUFORD The Flop That Was Reborn 'TENET' Christopher Nolan's "Tenet" -- a muscular, globetrotting, timeline-reversing epic featuring Russian oligarchs, a distressed damsel and lots of spy movie trappings -- was originally scheduled for release in July 2020, the heart of blockbuster season. Like Mr. Nolan's 2010 hit "Inception," it was supposed to be an arty moneymaker with a handsome cast of movie stars (including John David Washington and Robert Pattinson), a brand-name director and a relative guarantee that butts would land in seats. Then, as we know, the world happened. A mid-July release became a late July release, before finally being pushed into September. Major markets like New York and Los Angeles wouldn't play the movie indoors until 2021, which sent some hardcore fans searching for nearby drive-ins. Mr. Nolan -- famously a cheerleader for the purity of the theatrical experience -- had hoped his film would bring viewers back to theaters. (A video of Tom Cruise attending a screening while wearing a mask was meant to show them how.) But it far underperformed "Inception," leading some to declare it a flop. But was it? Instead of watching it on towering IMAX screens, millions of us watched (and puzzled over, thanks to its inscrutable plot) it on our relatively tiny Covid-bubble screens. Maybe that's why "Tenet" now feels like a pandemic fever dream. It's the biggest little movie of Mr. Nolan's career, a box office failure (that still made plenty of money) that feels like vapor, so yawning was the gap between the role it was meant to play in our lives and how it ultimately turned out. The film critic Keith Phipps most likely had it right when he said that "Tenet" was always destined to become a cult movie: both a victim and a beneficiary of the pandemic-upended release schedule. It was the blockbuster that went bust -- but then found an unlikely, completely appropriate second life. -- K. AUSTIN COLLINS The Daily Oasis of Sanity 'LUNCH DOODLES WITH MO WILLEMS' I think like many people in early March 2020, I couldn't or wouldn't comprehend the magnitude of an actual pandemic, so I didn't. I'd been traveling to Los Angeles, then I flew to D.C. for a big show where lots of kids would come and doodle while a jazz band improvised. But when I landed, I saw what was on the airport TV screens. That's when it hit me: We can't do this. So I canceled the show and flew home. I'd long been saying that I write about things that confuse me or scare me because if I'm confused or scared enough, I assume that it must be a universal emotion. On that plane, I knew I was afraid. So I thought, maybe other people were afraid, too. That gave me an idea. That was on Thursday, March 12. On Friday I called the Kennedy Center, where I was artist in residence, and pitched the idea of shooting a midday doodling session from my home studio. On Saturday, I wrote a few beat sheets, and my wife, Cher, and son, Trix, set up what we needed. On Sunday, we shot the first Lunch Doodle with a cellphone on a tripod on a table -- that was it. No lights. No microphone. We did it in one shot with no edits, then sent the video to the team at the Kennedy Center, who formatted it and announced on social media the video would drop on Monday at noon. As the week progressed, a pal got in touch to say, "You know what, let me send you a microphone." My mother-in-law reached out to say, "Let me send you a comb." The shows got tighter. It was, to be honest, stressful and isolating at the beginning. But within a couple of days, we started getting letters and drawings sent by kids. That felt good. The whole project gave our family agency, which is what we desperately needed in those early days. Thanks to the kids, our sense of being untethered in a stormy sea gave way to a sense of being connected to a community, which grew into a realization: Science was going to get us out of this pandemic. But art was going to get us through it. -- MO WILLEMS The 'Feel Good' Show 'TED LASSO' The Apple TV+ sitcom about an American college football coach brought to England to manage a Premier League football (i.e., soccer) team arrived with impeccable timing in August 2020. It has been held up innumerable times since as a widespread "balm," a feel-good show when we were most distinctly in need of good feelings. Ted's catchphrase, "I appreciate you," remains a sentence we could all benefit from uttering, and hearing, as often as possible. But just inches below the surface, "Ted Lasso" is also a show about isolation and loneliness and trying to build new forms of community -- and that feels just as emblematic of the past three years. Ted has left his wife and beloved son behind in Kansas, and the only person he knows in his new country is the assistant coach who came with him. He doesn't understand England. He doesn't understand soccer. He doesn't know how to navigate new social contexts. He doesn't even drink tea. And all of this unfolds for him against a backdrop of anxiety so profound that it results in occasional panic attacks. It's revealed in the second season that his father killed himself when Ted was a teenager -- in part, Ted believes, because as a boy he didn't say "I appreciate you" clearly or often enough. Isolation, new contexts, overwhelming changes, a backdrop of crippling anxiety -- does any of this sound familiar? Yes, "Ted Lasso" is a "feel-good" show. Like the best TV, however, it has sadness at its core. Ted may have helped many of us feel a little better during the pandemic. But he was struggling (and still is, with the third season now underway) right there along with us. --CHRISTOPHER ORR The Game That Twisted Time FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE When Square Enix revived its 1997 game Final Fantasy VII for a new cohort of players, the nostalgia for the original game's plot was hard-wired into it. Once again, you're an amnesiac ex-soldier hired to fight an omnipresent corporation. Once again, you're haunted by flashbacks and a mysterious brain fog. Yet the gamer's trip down memory lane takes a crucial detour as the final boss approaches -- and it becomes clear that he's aware of his defeat at the end of the original game, so he intends to bend the timeline to transform fate and evade his demise. Now allies, once doomed, survive; some battles, once won, are lost. What's really being remade in Remake is our own sense of chronology. As the story doubles back and flows upstream, our experience of the new game can't be separated from our recollections of the old one. How fitting that the game was released during a quarantine period that in limiting our physical space also compressed our sense of time. With our future murky and our present moment paused, we were left to steep in and obsess over past events, just like the game's protagonist. My biggest memory of Remake during quarantine wasn't playing it but watching my best friend, Ben, play it remotely over Twitch. Once the plot began to warp and turn on itself, its recursions and the hero's damaged memory seemed to mirror the experience of our own frozen, separated lives. How much time did the two of us spend together, alone, doing that? In recollection, I have no idea. -- FRANK GUAN The Uniform for Quarantine KIM KARDASHIAN'S SKIMS I admit it. I keep up with the Kardashians. So when Kim Kardashian told ambitious women to get your "ass up and work," I appreciated the irony. After all, the business that helped make her an advice-spouting billionaire is Skims -- a loungewear brand designed to be worn when you're not getting up to do anything at all. Skims began business near the end of 2019, selling shapewear to go under the clothes you wear out into the world, but by early 2020 Ms. Kardashian was pushing pajama sets that were perfect for staying at home. Sales quadrupled that year. "The pandemic hit and it was just selling out like crazy," she later told WWD. I was not exempt from its allure. In those early months of the pandemic, when I wasn't occupied with a fear of death, I spent my time pining for a tank top and shorts made of stretch bouclé yarn. Skims exemplified my longing to lounge, to take a breath -- but also my sadness that there seemed to be no reprieve from the hustle, even in a pandemic. Stuck at home, Ms. Kardashian reminded us, we were nonetheless expected to always be on, clad in designer loungewear we would need to keep grinding to afford. An ad from May 2020 shows Ms. Kardashian and her sister Khloe on the phone (read: socially distancing) and wearing clay masks. "What are you doing?" Kim asks. "Nothing, just lounging and wearing a mask," Khloe says. "I think that's the thing to do these days." They both laugh, lying around in their Skims, hard at work. -- JENNIFER WILSON The Schadenfreude Getaway 'THE WHITE LOTUS' "The White Lotus," Mike White's show about the idle wealthy and the people paid to pamper them, arrived like the "Fantasy Island" update we richly deserved. It offered twin pandemic satisfactions: an escape to a top-tier luxury resort and the chance to watch the slow torture of the kind of people who could afford that escape in real life. The show's premise was born of pandemic privations: Its first season, filmed at an otherwise shuttered Hawaiian resort, was conceived as a one-off workaround for Covid-related restrictions. But it struck such a nerve that it got a second season, this time in Sicily, with Mr. White once again combining the instincts of a high-end travel magazine editor and a sadistic satirist. "The White Lotus" was a necessary panacea, and a cleanse -- a round-trip ticket to a curdled world where social distancing referred to class, not germs. -- MARK HARRIS The Chance to Save the World PANDEMIC: THE GAME We cured the last disease before midmorning snack. My younger daughter, 6 years old, played the required yellow cards and her sister, 9, flipped over the corresponding token. I'm not sure I had ever before experienced such joy in my life. Playing the board game Pandemic in the early months of the actual pandemic occasioned such catharsis. Bounded by the dimensions of the board -- 23 inches by 16 inches -- the newfound danger in everyday things was temporarily suspended. Pandemic is a cooperative, tabletop game for two to four players, ages 8 and up. As part of a team of researchers, doctors and logistics experts, you work to eradicate four unnamed diseases before they take over the world. The game's creator, Matt Leacock, conceived it in the years after the 2003 SARS outbreak and before H1N1 in 2009 as "something that made your heart beat and got people working together." It's a game about losing control -- and gaining it back through collective effort. According to my Amazon order history, I purchased Pandemic on Sept. 8, 2019. I had hoped it would expand my daughters' gameplaying menu beyond Go Fish and Old Maid, but when I ripped off the cellophane and thumbed through the eight-page instruction manual, I figured it was just too involved. Then during the third week of lockdown, with my kids Zooming for school, my older daughter pulled Pandemic out of our game chest. I could think of lots of reasons not to play. Wouldn't it shatter the semblance of normality that my wife and I, like so many parents around the world, had fought to preserve for our children? Wasn't it trivializing all the suffering, all the death? "Dad, it's just a game!" my younger daughter said when I asked her if it would be too scary to play. So we played, and played again the next day, and again until it became a near-daily ritual. The instructions note that the typical game lasts 45 minutes, but ours would sometimes stretch well past an hour, as we moved around the board eradicating disease cubes along the vertexes connecting São Paulo with Lagos, Sydney with Los Angeles. Admittedly, we hacked things to serve our therapeutic purposes, choosing our roles rather than relying on the luck of the draw. My older daughter was nearly always the medic, swooping into cities and turning back the disease by her mere presence. My younger daughter, the scientist, would always find the cure. And I, the dispatcher (the least heroic role), helped both of them move more freely across the board. The analogy to parenting in the pandemic was inescapable: Weren't we all trying to get our children safely through while empowering them to find what freedom they could in the newly narrowed bands of their existence? Over the next year, our play went from once a day to once a week to once a month, then it stopped. But the game did its work. For my daughters and me, Pandemic expanded the expressive range of "pandemic," shading its meaning with hope, with comfort and with love. -- ADAM BRADLEY

Full text: Owning one of the N.F.L.'s storied franchises was Dan Snyder's dream. But his 24 years atop the team were marked by defiance, public battles and scandal.
When Daniel Snyder, at 34, became the youngest person to buy an N.F.L. franchise in 1999, he ushered in a wave of optimism and promise for the Washington franchise, a bedrock of the league.
Coming off a 6-10 season, the team still raked in revenue from an ardent fan base that flocked in droves to the suburban Maryland stadium named for its late owner, Jack Kent Cooke. The franchise's biggest worry back then was how to finance parking that would accommodate them all, a concern that didn't seem to trouble Snyder, a lifelong fan who called buying the team "the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me."
"In my dreams," Snyder said after the sale was confirmed, "we'd win the Super Bowl next year."
By the time he agreed in principle to sell the Washington Commanders for a record $ 6 billion on Thursday, Snyder was ravaged by scandals which drew N.F.L. investigations and legal inquiry. The formerly brash, big-spending owner had been pressured into changing the team's name and logo, buying out his partners and, eventually, to awaken from a dream which had turned into a nightmare for many.
Despite Snyder's dream, the team never won the Super Bowl in his tenure, or even made it as far as a conference championship game.
Here are some key moments from Daniel Snyder's tenure as owner of the N.F.L.'s Washington Commanders.
Snyder spends big on splashy free agents.
Stirring the fan base early, Snyder added future two future Hall of Famers, defensive end Bruce Smith and cornerback Deion Sanders, who signed a seven-year deal worth up to $ 56 million, as well as quarterback Jeff George. The moves backfired: Snyder fired Coach Norv Turner after Week 14, Washington missed the playoffs, and Sanders retired.
Washington becomes the first team to charge for training camp.
In a move that has since become the norm around the N.F.L., the team became the first to charge admission for training camp practices. Snyder said that the $ 10 a person charge would help improve access to players.
A playoff drought begins.
Washington won, 17-10, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2005 N.F.C. Wild Card game, the franchise's last playoff victory.
Washington sues fans for $ 3.6 million.
In the midst of the Great Recession the team sued 125 fans for trying to back out of contracts to purchase season tickets. The team won judgments of $ 2 million against the fans, including many who defaulted on the contracts because of financial losses during the economic downturn.
Fans are barred from bringing signs and banners to games.
After starting the season 2-4, the team stripped head coach Jim Zorn of the responsibility to call plays, handing it to an assistant coach lured out of retirement in Week 5. The team banned spectators from bringing any signs or banners into FedEx Field, citing security and comfort, after an increase in the number of signs critical of Snyder and Vinny Cerrato, a front office executive. Washington lifted the ban a month later.
Snyder sues Washington City Paper for defamation.
Snyder sued The Washington City Paper for $ 1 million alleging that the 2010 article, "The Cranky Redskins Fan's Guide to Dan Snyder," defamed him and included an antisemitic depiction of him. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Snyder said that he never read the article, which charted various public missteps, "because he heard all of the details."
After seven months, Snyder dropped the lawsuit.
Unable to sell tickets, the team removes 10,000 seats from the stadium.
The team reduced the capacity of FedEx Field from 91,704, then the second-largest capacity in the N.F.L., to around 82,000 after failing to find takers for many 400-level seats.
Team gets salary cap penalty
An independent arbitrator upheld the N.F.L.'s decision to fine Washington and the Dallas Cowboys for overspending on player contracts during the league's uncapped 2010 season. Washington was penalized $ 18 million a year for two years, and Dallas paid $ 5 million a year for two years.
Snyder joined Jerry Jones in fighting the penalties, one of many times the owners of two of the most valuable franchises bonded on a host of league issues including labor and television rights negotiations. Cornerstones of a bloc of hard line owners, the friends even filmed a Papa John's commercial together in 2010. Jones would remain Snyder's staunchest ally as scandals enveloped the Washington franchise.
Facing protests over the team's name, Snyder says it will "never" change.
For almost 90 years, Washington's pro football team was known as the Redskins, a word that is considered a slur against Native Americans. Facing protests over the name and mascot, and a federal lawsuit over the trademark, Snyder told USA Today that he would never change the name. "It's that simple. Never -- you can use caps," he said.
Cheerleaders accuse the team of sexual harassment.
In 2018, five former cheerleaders told The New York Times that they were sexually harassed and intimidated by the team and sponsors during a trip to Costa Rica for a swimsuit calendar photo shoot. The cheerleaders described being "pimped out" to the team's male sponsors who were invited to photo shoots where the cheerleaders were made to pose for photos while scantily dressed or, in some cases, naked.
After an internal investigation that lasted four months, Washington announced changes to the cheerleading team, including "more conservative outfits," the inclusion of male cheerleaders, and a ban on suite holders at the team's photo shoots. In 2021, the cheerleading program was scrapped in favor a coed dance team.
Pressure from corporate sponsors leads Washington to retire its contentious nickname.
Days after the team's biggest corporate sponsor, FedEx, asked the team to reconsider its name and mascot, Washington announced in a statement that it would drop the name and logo and rebrand. The franchise would be identified as the Washington Football Team until a replacement was decided upon.
The move came weeks after other team sponsors, including Nike and Pepsi, received letters from investors who called on the companies to cut their ties with the team. On July 2, FedEx, which pays about $ 8 million a year to have its name on the team's stadium in Landover, Md., told the team in a letter that if the team did not change its nickname it would ask that "FedEx" be taken off the stadium at the end of the season.
Nike had stopped selling the team's gear, and Walmart, Target and Amazon -- some of the country's largest retailers -- had said they would stop selling Washington's merchandise on their websites.
Female employees detail sexual harassment and verbal abuse.
In July 2020, The Washington Post published an investigation into the mistreatment of the team's female employees, citing 15 former front office workers.
Snyder fired several top executives who were named in the harassment accusations and hired a Washington-based law firm, Wilkinson Stekloff, to look into the allegations. Larry Michael, a play-by-play broadcaster and senior vice president with the team, retired after several women accused him of making derogatory comments to female employees.
The N.F.L. took over the investigation, which "concluded that for many years the workplace environment at the Washington Football Team, both generally and particularly for women, was highly unprofessional." In July 2021 the team was penalized $ 10 million and Snyder agreed to step away from the day-to-day operations of the team, handing the reins to his wife, Tanya.
More employees come forward on sexual misconduct in the workplace.
In August the Washington Post published a report detailing claims from 25 women who said that they experienced sexual harassment while working for the team dating back to 2008, including an allegation that a male staff member recorded lewd videos at cheerleader calendar photo shoots specifically for Snyder. The staff member and Snyder denied the claims.
Jon Gruden's emails to the team president go public.
The New York Times and Wall Street Journal published emails sent between 2011 and 2018 in which Jon Gruden, the former Buccaneers coach turned TV analyst, wrote racist and misogynist comments to Bruce Allen, then the president of the Washington team.
The emails were discovered during a review of workplace misconduct at the Washington Football Team. As the women who brought forward sexual harassment claims against the team lobbied for the N.F.L.'s investigation to be made public, members of Congress sought to review related documents.
FedEx stands collapse on Eagles fans.
Several Philadelphia Eagles fans fell from their seats when a railing near a player tunnel collapsed, nearly landing on Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts after a game in 2022. The fans sued the Commanders, and the litigation is ongoing.
Washington adopts the name Commanders.
After a two-year search, the team's announcement of a new name and logo were leaked ahead of the official rollout, which included a hype video that showcased the team's former, and potentially offensive, name.
Accusers at Congress implicate Snyder in new harassment claims.
At a congressional round table, two former team employees accused Snyder of creating a toxic workplace, with one claiming that he touched her inappropriately and another stating that he hosted a work event at his Aspen, Colo., home for which team executives hired prostitutes. Snyder called the allegations "outright lies." The N.F.L. opened a second investigation into the team, led by the former S.E.C. chair Mary Jo White.
A congressional subcommittee referred claims of the team's financial improprieties to the F.T.C.
Congress says Snyder conducted a "shadow investigation" of accusers.
In a 29-page memo, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform said Snyder directed a "shadow investigation" to interfere with and undermine the N.F.L.'s investigation, using private investigators to harass and intimidate witnesses, and creating a 100-page dossier targeting victims, witnesses and journalists who had shared "credible public accusations of harassment" against the team.
The memo came ahead of N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell's testimony before the committee, in which he defended the league's inquiry.
Snyder could not be served with a subpoena as he was out of the country. He later sits for a daylong private deposition and, in December, the committee concludes that Snyder impeded the investigation.
An N.F.L. owner calls for Snyder's removal.
At an N.F.L. team owners meeting, Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, said that there was "merit" to remove Snyder. Such a move would require at least 24 of the league's 32 owners to agree and would set a precedent for the league.
"We have to act," Irsay said. "He needs to be removed."
Snyders look for buyers for the Commanders.
Snyder announced that he hired bankers to explore a potential sale of some or all of the Commanders.
Federal probe of team's finances added to mounting criminal and civil inquiries.
An ESPN report details that federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating allegations of financial misconduct by Snyder and the Washington Commanders, stemming from a $ 55 million loan taken without the knowledge of his partners.
Snyder and the team also face several other inquiries, including from the attorney general for the state of Virginia into financial improprieties and two since-settled lawsuits filed by Karl Racine, the Washington D.C. attorney general, over season ticket sales.
Snyder agrees in principle to sell Commanders.
Josh Harris, an owner of the N.B.A.'s Philadelphia 76ers and the N.H.L.'s New Jersey Devils, agreed in principle to buy the Washington Commanders for a record $ 6 billion.

Snyder Agrees to Sell Commanders for $6 Billion: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The N.F.L. team is on track to be sold for a record figure to a group led by Josh Harris, as investigations into sexual harassment claims and the team's finances continue.
Josh Harris, an owner of the N.B.A.'s Philadelphia 76ers and the N.H.L.'s New Jersey Devils, agreed in principle to buy the Washington Commanders for a record $ 6 billion from Dan Snyder, the longtime owner of the team plagued by scandals that drew investigations from the N.F.L., Congress and other government agencies.
With the end of Snyder's tenure nearing, the N.F.L. can begin to distance itself from a painful chapter in its history and right the future of the popular franchise, which under Snyder had been tarnished by accusations of a toxic workplace and an inability to secure a new stadium.
The sale, first reported by Sportico, was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the agreement who was not authorized to speak publicly about the terms.
The agreement comes as the N.F.L. continues its second investigation into allegations of widespread sexual harassment made against executives at the team, including Snyder, as well as potential financial improprieties. Those allegations, coupled with Snyder's inability to build a new stadium and a backlash from the team's fans, had pushed many of the owners of the league's other teams to consider voting to force him to sell the team, which he bought in 1999 for $ 800 million.
Harris's group includes Mitchell Rales, a billionaire from the Washington, D.C., area, and a group of limited partners that includes Magic Johnson. Once they submit the deal, the sale would have to be approved by the league's finance committee and by at least three-quarters of the 31 other team owners, who next meet in person on May 22 and 23 in Minneapolis.
Spokesmen for the Commanders, the N.F.L. and Josh Harris declined to comment on the agreement.
Last June, the Walton family, founders of Walmart, bought the Denver Broncos for $ 4.65 billion, about twice as much as the previous record high for an N.F.L. team.
Snyder and his wife, Tanya, a co-owner of the team, formally began a search for a buyer in November 2022, when they hired Bank of America to seek offers for all or a portion of the Commanders. They began to field offers just weeks after the owner Jim Irsay of the Indianapolis Colts said that Snyder "needs to be removed," confirming what owners had been saying privately for months.
In recent years, Snyder has fended off a growing array of scandals and legal challenges. In July 2020, Snyder ceded to years of pressure, including from one of the team's biggest sponsors, FedEx, and agreed to change its longtime name, which many considered a slur against Native Americans.
Weeks later, dozens of women accused Snyder and top executives of sexual harassment of female employees. Snyder hired a prominent Washington lawyer to look into the charges, which were detailed in The Washington Post, but the league quickly took over the investigation.
"Today marks the end of a long, difficult chapter for all employees and fans of the Washington football organization," Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, the lawyers for more than 40 former Washington Commanders employees who levied claims of workplace violations, said in a statement. "We are proud of our many clients who made this moment possible -- the brave women and men who came forward repeatedly and at great personal risk to expose the decades of sexual harassment and financial wrongdoing at the team."
Snyder sued his limited partners claiming that they had tried to smear his reputation to undermine his ownership of the team, triggering a highly contentious legal battle that included accusations that Snyder financially mismanaged the club. The dispute went to a league-appointed mediator and ended in the spring of 2021 after the owners allowed Snyder to take on $ 450 million in additional debt so he could buy out the three limited partners whose stakes amounted to 40 percent of the club.
In July 2021, the league fined the club a record $ 10 million and ordered Snyder to stay away from the team after a league-helmed investigation found that a rampant culture of sexual harassment perpetuated by managers and executives had persisted at the team for more than a decade, and that Snyder had done nothing to stop it.
Though some executives were fired and others left, Snyder urged the league to keep the specific findings private, and Commissioner Roger Goodell released only a cursory summary. This led a congressional committee to launch its own investigation into the treatment of women in the team's front office. Witnesses testified to new claims against Snyder, who was deposed for more than 11 hours.
After the new allegations arose, the league ordered a second investigation led by Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor. The N.F.L. has yet to release her findings.
In November 2022, the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia opened a criminal investigation into allegations that the team committed financial improprieties. Snyder and the team were also sued by the attorneys general of Virginia and the District of Columbia. The latter case was settled, with the team agreeing to pay a $ 425,000 fine and refund about $ 200,000 in deposits to season-ticket holders.
Amid the legal inquiries and diminished public support, Snyder faced significant challenges in building a new stadium in the region to replace the aging FedEx Field, which opened in 1997 and has been plagued by pipe leaks and other structural failings.
The Commanders finished with winning records in just six of 24 seasons and won just two playoff games under Snyder. The losing, coupled with the creaky stadium, began to repel fans. The team routinely played to sold-out crowds during the 1980s and '90s, but ranked near the bottom of the N.F.L. in home attendance in recent seasons.
Still, Forbes in 2022 ranked the Commanders the eighth most valuable team in sports, ahead of the N.B.A.'s Los Angeles Lakers and Manchester United of the Premier League, in large part thanks to the N.F.L.'s revenue sharing model and the windfall ensured by football's media rights deals.
Last month, Jason Wright, the team's president, said the Commanders had improved their eroding finances after years of declining ticket and sponsorship sales, making the team more enticing to potential bidders.
"There will be people that come to partner with us that were unwilling to partner with us before, not necessarily because of ownership from a personal standpoint, but because of things that were said about the organization in the past," Wright said.
Harris, a founder of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management, leads the Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment holding company, an investment group that has revitalized the 76ers and the Devils. He is also an owner of the Premier League's Crystal Palace football club and holds a minority share in the Pittsburgh Steelers, which he must sell so he can take over ownership of the Commanders.
Harris, who grew up in Chevy Chase, Md., and attended the Field School in northwest Washington, cobbled together a big investment group. A week before the preliminary bids were due in February, he toured the team's training facility and stadium, as every qualified bidder is allowed to do, according to a person familiar with the Commanders' sale process.
The bid process was complicated because interest rates had shot up in the past year, raising the cost of borrowing money. Formerly a high-profile team owner, Snyder has remained largely out of public view and away from the team.
According to N.F.L. rules, every club must have a principal owner who owns at least 30 percent of the team, which means Harris will need to raise at least $ 1.8 billion on his own. He has an estimated net worth of $ 6 billion, according to Forbes.
In March, Harris recruited Rales, a co-founder of the Maryland-based Danaher Corporation, to join his investment group, a person with knowledge of the deliberations said. Rales has an estimated net worth of $ 5.6 billion, according to Forbes, and adds strong local ties to the ownership group.
Harris also recruited Magic Johnson, which will help satisfy other N.F.L. owners, who last March said in a statement that they would "regard it as a positive and meaningful factor" if prospective ownership groups "include diverse individuals who would have a significant equity stake in and involvement with the club."
Harris beat out Tilman J. Fertitta, the owner of the Houston Rockets of the N.B.A., who reportedly bid $ 5.6 billion for the Commanders. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was thought to be interested in buying the club, but does not appear to have made a bid for the team.

Mass Layoffs and Absentee Bosses Lead to a Morale Crisis at Meta: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Workers at Facebook's parent have been increasingly alarmed by job cuts and the company's direction.
"Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?" a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company's engineers this month. "Fire emoji if you think it's a dumpster fire."
In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.
"I'm already fired," added a former Meta employee who worked in the company's business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. "But who can keep track?"
Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, has declared that 2023 will be the "year of efficiency" at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the past six months, with two more to come; these will eliminate more than 21,000 people. Mr. Zuckerberg is also closing 5,000 open positions, which amounts to 30 percent of his company's work force.
At the same time, some of Meta's top executives have moved away and are managing large parts of the Silicon Valley company from their new homes in places like London and Tel Aviv.
The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Mr. Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Employees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company's stock price has dropped 43 percent from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Mr. Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. Some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.
"So many of the employees feel like they're in limbo right now," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. "They're saying it's 'Hunger Games' meets 'Lord of the Flies,' where everyone is trying to prove their worth to management."
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is not the only big tech company that has hit the brakes on spending. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, shed office space, dropped perks and pulled back from experimental initiatives.
But Meta appears to face the most challenges. Last year, the company reported consecutive quarters of declining revenue -- a first since it became a public company in 2012.
While Meta's peers are chasing a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence, Mr. Zuckerberg has made a big bet on the metaverse, an immersive online world. But it is unclear if consumers will embrace his vision in the way he hopes. While the company has sold 20 million virtual reality headsets -- more than any other company producing similar tech -- it has struggled to keep customers returning regularly to use the product.
Many workers at Meta had already been skeptical of Mr. Zuckerberg's shift toward the metaverse. Those concerns have grown as consumer enthusiasm for the virtual world has lagged, the employees said.
The absence of many top executives from Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., is compounding worries. Mr. Zuckerberg, 38, is on parental leave after the birth of his third child, three Meta employees said, but is regularly meeting with executives on important topics. (A.I. is at the top of that list.)
Even though Mr. Zuckerberg has encouraged rank-and-file employees to return to the company's headquarters, several of his top lieutenants have moved away.
Naomi Gleit, one of Meta's first employees and now head of product, recently moved to New York, joining three other senior Meta managers and executives based there. Guy Rosen, Meta's chief information security officer, moved back to Tel Aviv, where he lived when his company, Onavo, was acquired. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, is living in London. And Javier Olivan, Meta's chief operating officer, is splitting his time between Europe and Silicon Valley.
While the executives have been joining Meta's weekly meetings through video chats, their absence from the Menlo Park offices has been felt, employees said, especially since Mr. Zuckerberg recently stressed that he expected employees to return to the office.
A spokesman for Meta said its executives continued to travel regularly to the Silicon Valley offices.
Within Meta, there is pressure to demonstrate that people are working hard, two employees said. Intense scrutiny has come in recent workplace reviews. Workers, especially in middle management, are being asked to justify why their jobs are crucial to Meta's goals.
Some employees are trying to make themselves look busier, two people said. That has made people more possessive about their work, the people said, which has meant less collaborating with co-workers. One person described the atmosphere as "cutthroat."
Meta declined to comment on internal matters.
While the first two rounds of layoffs largely affected business and recruiting teams, the cuts expected this month will focus on tech departments, including engineers, which has surprised employees, said four employees, who were not authorized to speak to reporters. Insiders expect engineering cuts to hit teams inside WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, they said.
In one of his regular question-and-answer sessions with employees this year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that there was no "perfect way to do" layoffs, and that he wanted to err on the side of providing more information about upcoming layoffs as news of the cuts began to leak to the press. The Information previously reported on the meeting.
Meta employees have created memes and inside jokes about how much time workers have left. In messaging groups and workplace chats in recent weeks, they have been using skull-and-bones emojis to signal to one another that they may be part of the layoffs, according to screenshots seen by The Times.
Those remaining have griped about reduced bonuses and perks. One engineer created a bot that would automatically calculate the loss in the value of Meta stock held by employees, part of their compensation package.
The cutbacks include trimming Meta's real estate. The company has terminated leases for offices across the Bay Area, including space in San Francisco, Fremont, Sunnyvale and Menlo Park, according to two people familiar with the cuts. In February, the company announced that it would pay to end leases early and cut Meta's real estate contracts in some areas.
The company is also cutting back on some of its lavish perks, once considered necessary to attract top talent. Last year, Meta ended its free laundry service for employees and pushed dinner service later into the evening -- a way to cut down on workers' loading up free food to take home.
Workers complained in internal chat rooms that the company was cutting back on amenities. One was frustrated that there was no more cereal in the worker's office, and that snacks in "micro-kitchens" were not being restocked as regularly. Many believed that cafeteria options had gone downhill.
Employee travel expenses are also being scrutinized more closely, and workers have been asked to cut down on nonessential travel.
At WhatsApp, Meta's popular messaging product, insiders are anticipating fewer cuts and structural changes on the business side than in the rest of the company, two current employees said. Mr. Zuckerberg wants to increase the cadence of delivering new, revenue-generating features in WhatsApp, which he bought nine years ago for $ 19 billion.
While employees complain they aren't hearing enough from Mr. Zuckerberg, he still surprised some this year when he dropped into a discussion group for Metamates, the name given to employees.
Workers were gossiping about a recent news article that noted Sergey Brin and Larry Page's return to Google to assist with the company's artificial intelligence strategy, two employees who witnessed the exchange said. One worker joked how the founders' return might inspire Mr. Zuckerberg to get back to coding at Facebook.
Later, Mr. Zuckerberg replied to the employees, who didn't know he was lurking in the discussion.
"I never left," he wrote.

SAN FRANCISCO — “Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?” a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company’s engineers this month. “Fire emoji if you think it’s a dumpster fire.”
In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.
“I’m already fired,” added a former Meta employee who worked in the company’s business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. “But who can keep track?”
Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, has declared that 2023 will be the “year of efficiency” at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the last six months, eliminating more than 26,000 people, or nearly 30% of his company’s workforce.
At the same time, some of Meta’s top executives have moved away and are managing large parts of the Silicon Valley company from their new homes in places like London and Tel Aviv, Israel.
The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Employees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company’s stock price has dropped 43% from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. And for the first time, some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.
“So many of the employees feel like they’re in limbo right now,” said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. “They’re saying it’s ‘Hunger Games’ meets ‘Lord of the Flies,’ where everyone is trying to prove their worth to management.”
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is not the only big tech company that has hit the brakes on spending. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, shed office space, dropped perks and pulled back from experimental initiatives.
But Meta appears to face the most challenges. Last year, the company reported consecutive quarters of declining revenue — a first since it became a public company in 2012.
While Meta’s peers are chasing a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg has made a big bet on the metaverse, an immersive online world. But it is unclear if consumers will embrace his vision in the way he hopes. While the company has sold 20 million virtual reality headsets — more than any other company producing similar tech — it has struggled to keep customers returning regularly to use the product.
Many workers at Meta had already been skeptical of Zuckerberg’s shift toward the metaverse. Those concerns have grown as consumer enthusiasm for the virtual world has lagged, the employees said.
The absence of many top executives from Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, is compounding worries. Zuckerberg, 38, is on parental leave after the birth of his third child, three Meta employees said, but is regularly meeting with executives on important topics. (AI is at the top of that list.)
Even though Zuckerberg has encouraged rank-and file employees to return to the company’s headquarters, several of his top lieutenants have moved away.
Naomi Gleit, one of Meta’s first employees and now head of product, recently moved to New York, joining three other senior Meta managers and executives based there. Guy Rosen, Meta’s chief information security officer, moved back to Tel Aviv, where he lived when his company, Onavo, was acquired. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, is living in London. And Javier Olivan, Meta’s chief operating officer, is splitting his time between Europe and Silicon Valley.
While the executives have been joining Meta’s weekly meetings through video chats, their absence from the Menlo Park offices has been felt, employees said, especially since Zuckerberg recently stressed that he expected employees to return to the office.
A spokesperson for Meta said its executives continued to travel regularly to the Silicon Valley offices.
Within Meta, there is pressure to demonstrate that people are working hard, two employees said. Intense scrutiny has come in recent workplace reviews, which management consultancy firm Bain and Co. is assisting. Workers, especially in middle management, are being asked to justify why their jobs are crucial to Meta’s goals.
Some employees are trying to make themselves look busier, two people said. That has made people more possessive about their work, the people said, which has meant less collaborating with co-workers. One person described the atmosphere as “cutthroat.”
Meta declined to comment on internal matters.
While the first two rounds of layoffs largely affected business and recruiting teams, the cuts expected this month will be the first to affect tech departments, including engineers, which has surprised employees, said four employees, who were not authorized to speak to reporters. Insiders expect engineering cuts to hit teams inside WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, they said.
In one of his regular question-and-answer sessions with employees this year, Zuckerberg said that there was no “perfect way to do” layoffs, and that he wanted to err on the side of providing more information about upcoming layoffs as news of the cuts began to leak to the press. The Information previously reported on the meeting.

Full text: "Air" tells the origin story of the iconic brand, but it's long had a hold on Hollywood, from "Do the Right Thing" to "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."
In "Air," the new biographical sports drama about Nike's 1984 effort to land an endorsement deal with then-N.B.A. rookie Michael Jordan, the Air Jordan is the sneaker holy grail. Designed by the eccentric genius Peter Moore, the sleek, stylish basketball shoe seems not so much created as discovered -- as if, Moore says in the film, "it's always been here," much the way Michelangelo found his sculptures "already complete within the marble block."
The film, directed by Ben Affleck, tells the story of how the Air Jordan came to be. If anything, the movie undersells the Air Jordan's pop cultural significance: Almost as soon as the sneaker was released, it become a phenomenon, not only raising the ceiling for shoe sales but also redefining the very limits of footwear success. In the four decades since its debut, the Air Jordan has continued to thrive: Jordan Brand, now a subsidiary of Nike, earned more than $ 5 billion in sales in 2022. Retro Air Jordan releases often sell out in minutes, with aftermarket demand routinely driving resale prices into four figures and beyond.
Before its reverent screen treatment in "Air," the Air Jordan already had an important place in movie history, as the unheralded star -- sometimes central, sometimes lurking in the background -- of countless motion pictures. To better understand how the shoe's role in pop culture has evolved over the years, we looked back at some of its most notable big-screen appearances.
'Do the Right Thing'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In a famous scene in Spike Lee's Brooklyn-set "Do the Right Thing," the chippy Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) is looking fresh in a clean pair of Air Jordan 4s -- until a run-in with a boorish local gentrifier (John Savage) leaves them lamentably scuffed. "You stepped on my brand-new white Air Jordans I just bought!" Buggin Out howls in outrage.
It's an unforgivable affront, and one any sneakerhead knows all too well: Like a dent in a new car, a scuff is hard to come back from. And as the scene makes amusingly clear, a brand-new pair of Jordans isn't cheap -- even in 1989. "How much did you pay for those, man?" a friend asks, indignant on Buggin's behalf. Other pals chime in: "A hundred bucks! American dollars! A hundred and eight with tax!"
This scene quickly achieved a kind of immortality among sneaker collectors, and in 2017, Jordan Brand paid tribute to the film with a special-edition release. The exclusive Jordan 4s were designed to look exactly like the ones Buggin Out wore -- complete with replica scuff.
'Space Jam'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
For Jordan's much-anticipated screen debut, it was only reasonable that His Airness should don an exclusive set of kicks. "Space Jam" -- in which Jordan, playing himself, helps Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes defeat the evil alien Nerdlucks on the court -- saw the unveiling of the Air Jordan 11 in an exclusive white, black and purple colorway, featured prominently throughout the film's climactic game.
Although the movie came out in 1996, at what was arguably the height of Jordan's N.B.A. career, the shoe was not made available until 2000, when it instantly became a collector's item. (It was rereleased in 2009 and again in 2016.) To this day, the Space Jam Jordan remains one of the most beloved editions of the popular silhouette -- and the film remains one of the most enduring love letters to the beauty of the shoe.
'He Got Game'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Spike Lee had deep ties with Nike going back to 1986 when he played Mars Blackmon in his debut feature, "She's Gotta Have It," later reprising the role in a series of TV commercials for the Air Jordan. When he set out to make "He Got Game," he leveraged that connection, managing to secure a pair of then-unreleased Jordan 13s months before they were available to the public or even worn by Jordan himself on the court.
Denzel Washington stars as Jake Shuttlesworth, a convict offered a chance for a commuted life sentence if he can persuade his estranged son, Jesus (Ray Allen), one of the country's top high school basketball prospects, to enroll at the governor's alma mater. Shortly after being let out on work release, Jake heads to a sneaker store, where the clerk (Avery Glymph) immediately shows off the latest Jordan model. "I was all about Jordans, and to have those shoes in my hands, knowing I was like the first person to hold them, was kind of cool," Glymph told Andscape magazine in 2019.
'White House Down'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Air Jordan's appeal is so democratic that in the action blockbuster "White House Down," even the leader of the free world wears them. Jamie Foxx, as President James Sawyer, dons a pair of Air Jordan 4s in the fan-favorite Fire Red colorway, using them to sneak past armed terrorists during an attempted kidnapping and violent White House takeover. ("Get your hands off my Jordans!" Sawyer bellows, as one tenacious bad guy wrestles with him on the floor.) It's a small appearance, but one that makes clear the Jordan's ascendancy from basketball shoe to streetwear staple to common accessory with formal tailoring.
'Kicks'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When Brandon (Jahking Guillory), a 15-year-old sneakerhead of limited means, lucks into a coveted pair of Air Jordan 1s for pennies on the dollar, they become his most prized possession, lifting his spirits and imbuing him with newfound confidence. He's so in love with the shoes that he's reluctant to do anything in them, sitting out a pickup game for fear they'll get mussed. "They're called Jordans," his friend teases him. "He played basketball!"
"Kicks," an indie drama from the director Justin Tipping, follows Brandon as he tries to track down his Air Jordans after they're stolen by gangsters, an adventure that puts him in danger. The film shows how desperately a kid like Brandon can pine after Jordans, and how Jordans can come to mean much more than footwear. "They're not just shoes," Brandon asserts at one point, and the film compellingly demonstrates that truth.
'Uncle Drew'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The goofy sports satire "Uncle Drew" stars Dallas Mavericks point guard Kyrie Irving as the eponymous elderly basketball legend, a character he played in several popular Pepsi Max commercials in the early 2010s. But the movie is really about Dax (Lil Rel Howery), an amateur basketball coach with lofty aspirations who is struggling to make his sports dreams come true.
Dax works a day job at Foot Locker, where he's prevailed upon by his team's vain and entitled star player, Casper (Aaron Gordon), to use his insider connections to buy every player a matching set of Jordan 11s. It's a staggering expense he can barely afford, and it fails to prevent Casper from ditching his team for a rival's soon afterward. Interestingly, the sneaker itself is the rereleased Space Jam Jordan 11 from 2016, drawing a connection between Irving's Uncle Drew and the classic Michael Jordan film.
'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The single most iconic screen Jordan since "Space Jam" arrived in the animated superhero flick "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse." The new Spider-Man Miles Morales (the voice of Shameik Moore) wears a pair of Air Jordan 1s in the original Chicago colorway, playfully loose, laces untied. (That is remarked upon so often that it becomes a running joke.) The sneakers are variously lingered over, zoomed in on and even featured prominently on the movie's poster. The focus brought new attention to the classic sneaker, and introduced a generation of viewers to a shoe whose original heyday came before many of them were born. To commemorate the film, Jordan Brand released a special edition Jordan 1 with a distinctive webbed pattern, known as the Spider-Man Origin Story.

We May Be Headed for What the Fed Won't Name: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A hard landing? A banana? Euphemisms for recession have a long history in Washington. Whatever the Fed is stating, it seems to be expecting something ugly, our columnist says.
Recession has become a nasty word. Federal Reserve officials dance around it with euphemisms like "a soft landing" or its dreaded alternative, "a hard landing."
Look beneath the hood of Fed forecasts, though, and it's clear that central bank policymakers recognize that there is a good chance of a sharp slowdown soon. Their own policies are at least partly responsible for making that happen.
The odds of such a slowdown over the next year are fairly high, I'd say, whatever label the authoritative arbiter of such things, the National Bureau of Economic Research, ends up giving the 2023 economy months or years from now. This emphatically does not mean that there will be a recession -- or that I or anyone else has the ability to predict one with precision. But I think there's enough reason to suspect that rough times are coming to factor that possibility into your personal planning.
A (Groucho) Marxian Analysis
Back in the late 1970s, when the Cornell economist Alfred Kahn was the Carter administration's "inflation czar," he got into political trouble for describing economic declines with clear and disturbing words like "depression" and "recession." I always think of him as Professor Kahn, because he was a dean at Cornell in the early 1970s, just before he entered the world of public policy. He frequently told us, above all else, to use plain and simple English.
When Professor Kahn left Ithaca for government posts, he became renowned for those precepts, attacking "the artificial and hyper-legal language that is sometimes known as bureaucratese or gobbledygook." Those words come from a memo he wrote to his staff at the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977. The Washington Post published the whole thing. Please, he told government employees, use "straightforward, quasi-conversational, humane prose -- as though you are talking to or communicating with real people."
By 1978, however, as inflation czar, Professor Kahn had found that the rules of simple, clear language just didn't apply to high-level presidential appointees dealing with potential economic downturns.
Recession? Too scary. Depression? Even worse. Political operatives within the Carter administration chastised him for saying those words out loud. So he found a better, Marxian term -- one fit for Groucho, not Karl. Henceforth, he said, economic downturns were "bananas," as in this sentence: "Between 1973 and 1975 we had the deepest banana that we had in 35 years, and yet inflation dipped only very briefly."
When the banana lobby protested, he began to talk of a coming "kumquat."
Well, we may be facing a banana or a kumquat, of indeterminate size, very soon.
Soft and Hard Landings
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has focused mainly on battling inflation for more than a year. Until last month, he had been saying the Fed could raise interest rates and pare its swollen balance sheet without wreaking too much harm. This approach works by slowing the economy and cooling the labor market.
The United States, he had said, could have what he called a pleasant and soft landing.
But in March, he said that benign outcome was less likely as a result of tightening conditions caused by bank failures. The emergency rescue operations by the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other regulators ensured that depositors had access to their money. Financial markets calmed down.
The banking crisis has added to the risk that real trouble may be ahead of us. Typically when financial conditions tighten a lot, millions of people are thrown out of work. If such a downturn is prolonged and protracted, months after the fact it is labeled a recession.
Still, the banking troubles have improved the chances that inflation can be tamed without the need for too many more Fed interest rate increases. The Fed's financial tightening has already created greater stress in the financial system -- stress that, so far, has emerged in the form of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and troubles in other institutions, including First Republic.
The economy looks fairly strong. The unemployment rate in March was just 3.5 percent, though job growth slowed. Futures prices show that investors can't make up their minds about what will happen next. The probability of a rate increase in May, at the next Fed policymaking meeting, has been veering up and down.
There is evidence of inconsistency in the Fed's own forecasts, as Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor and chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors, has pointed out in notes to clients.
On March 27, he observed that the Fed's "growth forecast of just 0.4 percent for the year implicitly includes a sudden stop in the economy, assuming activity rebounded in the first quarter as G.D.P. tracking indicators suggest." Indeed, the real-time G.D.P. estimate produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta shows the economy growing in the first three months of the year at an annualized rate of about 1.5 percent.
The Fed doesn't spell this out. But for growth for the full year to fall to 0.4 percent, as the Fed predicts, the economy would need to shrink rapidly in the next six months or so. Financial tightening -- whether brought about by interest rate increases, bank failures, the reduction of assets on the Fed's balance sheet or a combination of them -- works slowly on the broader economy. Its precise effects can't be accurately predicted, so we are in an awkward period.
Whether the slowdown engineered by the Fed will be justifiably called a soft landing -- a slowdown that won't be remembered as a particularly devastating downturn in years to come -- or a crash that really hurts millions of people is a crucial question.
"A sudden stop in the economy sufficient to drive a large increase in the unemployment rate will almost surely have enough momentum to shift the Fed's concerns away from inflation and back to employment," Mr. Duy wrote. "Clearly, the Fed would see a sufficiently weak labor market as a disinflationary event."
If a big slowdown comes, the Fed will have to pivot and cut interest rates. But we just don't know right now.
The Implications
How this plays out will affect many vital things: whether some of us keep our jobs, whether price increases moderate and whether the prices of stocks, bonds and real estate rise or fall. No one has clear answers.
Certainly, the markets, which represent the collective wisdom of investors, have not done a particularly good job of forecasting the state of the economy over the last year.
The latest data from Morningstar on mutual fund and exchange-traded fund performance bear this out. Investors have been befuddled by economic trends.
In the 12 months through March, the average stock fund lost 8.3 percent, while the average taxable bond fund lost 3.6 percent. That was a terrible year. In the first three months of this year -- mainly, before the bank crisis -- investors did much better. The average stock fund rose 5.4 percent, while the average taxable bond fund returned 2.6 percent.
What is striking about these results is that there is no consistency from year to year. The funds that did best in the first quarter of 2023 tended to be among the worst for the last 12 months. The Virtus Zevenbergen Innovative Growth Stock Fund, for example, gained 28.4 percent in the quarter, a spectacular result. But for the 12 months through March, it lost 32.1 percent. The underlying stocks in the portfolio -- including Tesla, Amazon and Nvidia -- had Jekyll and Hyde performances, too, depending on which month you looked at them.
Similarly, the performance of bond funds with blue-chip holdings was painfully erratic. The Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury Index fund, for example, contains Treasury bonds. What could be steadier or safer?
Well, bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, and as interest rates rose last year, the fund's bonds lost value. What's more, the fund holds 20-or-more-year bonds, which made them particularly vulnerable, because the longer a bond's duration, the greater the price changes when interest rates move.
In this case, the Vanguard fund gained 6.4 percent in the first quarter, largely because bond yields fell as traders bet that a recession would be coming soon and that the Fed would be dropping interest rates. But over the 12 months through March, which included a long stretch of interest rate increases, the fund lost 24 percent. If there is a recession, this will be a good fund to own. If rates rise, though, the fund could lose money again.
Right now, I'd be careful.
I always try to invest for the long term and hold diversified groups of stocks and bonds in low-cost index funds that track the entire market. But I'm also stashing away as much money as I can in safe places.
Fortunately, money market funds are providing good value now. They are paying yields of close to 5 percent simply because they track the short-term interest rates controlled by the Fed.
If there is a recession and the Fed pivots abruptly, high-quality bonds could be expected to gain in value, while money market rates would fall. The stock market might drop sharply on signs of a major slowdown. But stocks could be expected to rise once the Fed deemed it time to slash rates sharply and strengthen the economy. Trying to time these shifts is treacherous.
The best outcome would no doubt be that often discussed soft landing, accompanied by a decline in the rate of inflation. Jobs would be preserved, and the markets could embark on another bull run.
But be nimble. We could be hurtling toward a banana.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The C.D.C. traced deaths and cases of blindness to products imported from India. The agency said it was concerned that the bacteria could gain a foothold in the U.S.
A highly drug-resistant bacteria that was linked to eyedrops imported from India and that spread from person to person in a Connecticut long-term care center has prompted concerns that the strain could gain a foothold in U.S. health care settings, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Infectious disease specialists said the strain had not been previously detected in the United States, and that it was particularly difficult to treat with existing antibiotics.
In recent months, three deaths, eight cases of blindness and dozens of infections have been traced to EzriCare artificial tears, according to the C.D.C., leading to a widespread recall this year.
The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates over-the-counter medicine, has stopped imports of the product. But these outbreaks highlight regulatory gaps in controlling imports of overseas medications.
The F.D.A. confirmed that it had not inspected the factory where the eyedrops were made in India before the infections were reported, but that the agency had since visited the plant, which is operated by Global Pharma Healthcare.
The agency has long been criticized for lapses in inspections of overseas manufacturing in China and India, which are the two major producers of drugs and raw ingredients for medicines. Other instances of contaminated products from overseas included blood pressure medications suspected of containing a possible carcinogen and deadly batches of heparin, both of which prompted mass recalls.
The F.D.A. said it was continuing to work with the C.D.C. and had urged retailers to make sure the products were removed from shelves.
In the latest instance, the eyedrops are linked to bacteria that is even more drug-resistant than a similar bacteria that the C.D.C. tends to see in about 150 cases per year, mostly in intensive-care settings, according to Maroya Walters, lead investigator for the C.D.C.'s antimicrobial resistance team.
Dr. Walters said the spread of the newest strain "really could change the outlook for that."
The bacteria showed signs of spreading within the Connecticut center among asymptomatic patients who had the bacteria colonized in their bodies. Such spread tends to occur when patients touch common items or when health care workers transmit the germs.
The bacterium linked to the eyedrops, drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is already a top concern for health care providers, especially among those with compromised immune systems, nursing home residents and patients with invasive medical devices like catheters and breathing tubes.
Dr. David van Duin, an infectious disease specialist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said resistant pseudomonas was especially difficult to eradicate, both from health care facilities, where it clings tenaciously to sink drains, water faucets and other moist environments, and from patients who develop bloodstream infections.
"It's very hard to get rid of," he said.
By now, cases associated with the eyedrops have largely been contained, thanks to a product recall and widespread attention from the news media, Dr. Walters said. The F.D.A. had also announced the recall of Delsam Pharma's Artificial Eye ointment, which was made in the same factory as the eyedrops, because of possible contamination.
The C.D.C. is asking doctors to work with public health labs to determine the genetic fingerprint of hard-to-treat Pseudomonas infections in the eye and throughout the body.
"I think we are going to see the impact of this play out over the course of months to years," Dr. Walters said.
In late December, the C.D.C. linked the EzriCare drops to an outbreak that has affected 68 patients in 16 states, including eight patients who lost their vision and four who had an eyeball removed.
The F.D.A. has not said how much of the product made by Global Pharma Healthcare in Chennai, India, was imported.
However, records provided to The New York Times by Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, show that Global Pharma sent U.S. distributors four shipments in 2021 and 2022 amounting to tens of thousands of half-ounce bottles of EzriCare artificial tears.
While the F.D.A. requires a pre-approval inspection of plants that manufacture prescription drugs, there is no such mandate for those that make over-the-counter medicines like artificial tears. Compounding the problem, the number of inspections the agency conducts has plummeted since the pandemic began.
Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, expressed concern about the F.D.A.'s ability to oversee what she described as "substandard safety practices" at U.S. and foreign plants, and called for providing the agency with more funding and greater authority to recall products. "Lives are at stake," she said in a statement.
On Jan. 3, the F.D.A. blocked Global Pharma's imports, saying the company had provided "an inadequate response to a records request" and violated manufacturing rules. Shannon P. Hatch, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that the import alert was unrelated to the outbreak.
The F.D.A. also said it recommended a voluntary recall on Feb. 2 over a "lack of appropriate microbial testing," formulation issues and the absence of proper controls around tamper-evident packaging. The agency conducted an unannounced inspection at the India plant from Feb. 20 through March 2 and found a litany of problems with the plant's sterility practices, according to an inspection report that was first reported by STAT news.
Clean-room operators were not qualified for the job, and they wore discolored and worn-out foot covers, the report said. An inspector noted "a black, brown colored greasy deposit" on machinery in a room where bottles were filled with the eye drops. One worker acknowledged to an inspector that there was no procedure for cleaning one of the filling machines, according to the report.
Global Pharma did not respond to questions in March. But on Feb. 1, the company said it had "not determined whether our manufacturing facility is the source of the contamination." EzriCare said on its website that it marketed the drops, but that it had no role in the "actual manufacturing of this product." Wal-Mart and Amazon, among the larger retailers that sold the drops, did not respond to requests for comment.
Clara Elvira Oliva, 68, a contact lens wearer from Florida, began using EzriCare Artificial Tears to moisturize her eyes at the recommendation of the ophthalmologist at her health clinic.
One morning in August, she woke up to find her right eye red and itchy and oozing liquid. Alarmed, she returned that day to the ophthalmologist, who prescribed antibiotic drops. But in the weeks that followed, she said, the irritation persisted and her eyesight began to deteriorate, stumping eye care providers who prescribed an ever-changing variety of antibiotic and antifungal drops.
All the while, she kept using the EzriCare drops in both eyes. "No one told me to stop using them," Ms. Oliva said in an interview.
By the end of August, the infection in her right eye had become so dire that specialists told her she would need a cornea transplant. After the operation, she was told the eye was so ravaged by infection that doctors had no choice but to remove it.
"Since that day, my life has never been the same," said Ms. Oliva, a retired cosmetologist who lives with her son in Miramar.
Dr. Walters collected mounting reports of antibiotic-resistant infections in several states that had a strikingly similar genetic fingerprint.
C.D.C. investigators examined an outbreak of about two dozen cases at the long-term care center in Connecticut, where they saw evidence of bacterial spread among residents. That investigation pointed to eyedrops, but the center's records made it difficult to tell what type had been used.
By late December, the C.D.C. had tested 23 open bottles of eyedrops. Eleven of the EzriCare artificial tear bottles harbored bacteria, and seven of those matched the outbreak strain, Dr. Walters said.
While the finding is not definitive proof that the bacteria came from the bottle and not from touching an infected eye, the evidence was compelling, Dr. Walters said.
For Ms. Oliva, the vision in her left eye, already compromised by scarring, continues to deteriorate, making it difficult to drive, cook and read. Unsteady on her feet, she avoids going out. "Sometimes I bump into people because I don't see them, but they think I'm just not paying attention," she said.
Ms. Oliva's lawyer, Natasha Cortes, said she was investigating two cases of patients who went to the same clinic and developed vision problems, as well as five others.
The outbreak has renewed longstanding concerns about the quality and frequency of the F.D.A.'s overseas inspections.
In June 2020, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, held an oversight hearing on the F.D.A.'s foreign inspection process, noting that the plants were given 12 weeks' advance notice, "plenty of time to doctor up a facility to make sure that it passes inspection." The agency has since received budget authority to conduct unannounced overseas inspections.
The F.D.A. paused overseas inspections during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, and the number of foreign inspections remained low last year, at 684 compared with 3,272 in 2019, according to agency data.
The F.D.A. has 4,000 overseas facilities to inspect, with about 20 percent in India; one of its six inspector positions in that country was vacant in late 2021, according to a report issued last year by the Government Accountability Office.
For over-the-counter drugs, the F.D.A. uses a system that essentially lists a medication recipe. Companies can make the products without express agency approval but are expected to follow agency rules for manufacturing quality products, said John Serio, lawyer with Withers Worldwide who has pharmaceutical clients.
"If you're not out there inspecting facilities," Mr. Serio said, "these sorts of problems will crop up because there's no threat that if you're out of compliance that the inspector will come knocking at your door."
Dr. Vicente Diaz, the chief of ophthalmology at Yale Health Plan in Connecticut who specializes in infectious diseases, said the infections evading the "big gun" antibiotics had alarmed experts. He worries that if doctors use ineffective antibiotics for too long or wait to culture a bug, "that gives the bacteria more time to multiply and get more aggressive," he said.
EzriCare drops do not contain preservatives, a fact that Dr. Diaz found troubling. He said he had never seen another reusable eye product without preservatives or other safety features to limit bacterial growth. Preservative-free drops usually come in single-use bottles, given the risk, he said.
"I'm surprised that formulation was allowed to go on the market without more scrutiny," he said. "It's kind of like the perfect storm."

In Battle of the Bots, Human Assistants Are the Real Losers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google's Bard chatbot fared far worse than OpenAI's ChatGPT, but human assistants might soon be out of their jobs.
By now, plenty of us know that artificially intelligent virtual assistants like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard can pull off sensational stunts, such as winning coding contests, passing bar exams and professing love to a tech columnist.
But I wondered: How helpful are the bots, really, as actual assistants?
It's worth asking because our first rodeo with virtual assistants didn't go so well. Older A.I. bots like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa had more than a decade to improve, but they ended up stagnating and are now used mostly for setting timers and playing music.
ChatGPT and Bard, on the other hand, use so-called large language models that recognize and generate text based on enormous data sets scraped off the web. They are trained to compose sentences on the fly as if they were human, which potentially makes them far more versatile as assistants.
To test that theory, I came up with a list of tasks that people might ask of a human assistant. I prodded friends who have been executive assistants and start-up founders who have worked with professional helpers, and I read executive assistant job postings on LinkedIn.
Then I rounded up the four most common responsibilities of an executive assistant, which appeared to be:
Helping with meeting preparations by doing research and professional background checks on the person an executive is meeting with.
Summarizing meetings and jotting down the notes in a tidy, easily scannable format.
Planning business trips and compiling detailed travel itineraries.
Managing an executive's calendar, including booking meetings and rescheduling appointments.
Finally, I turned to ChatGPT and Bard and told the chatbots to assume that I was the chief executive of a lazily named A.I. start-up, Artificially Intelligent, and that they were my executive assistants. I asked them to help with each of these tasks.
My experiment illustrated just how far behind Bard is from ChatGPT. But more important, the chatbots succeeded in carrying out most of the tasks, even if imperfectly.
That raised the question of whether the chatbots could eventually automate the roles of human executive assistants, as well as other white-collar jobs that involve administrative work, including front desk workers and accounting professionals -- a disturbing thought with no clear answers.
Here's what unfolded with the A.I. helpers.
Meeting Preparation
I started by telling ChatGPT and Bard that I was meeting with a potential investor next week. I randomly picked Scott Forstall, a well-known former Apple executive whose work history is publicly available on the web. I then asked the bots to do a background check on him and help compile talking points to persuade him to invest in my start-up.
ChatGPT did the job with aplomb. It summarized Mr. Forstall's education and work history, including his departure from Apple in 2012 and his shift into Broadway production -- all information that can be pulled from his Wikipedia page. More impressive, it coached me on helpful strategies to win him over as an investor.
"Showcase how your start-up combines A.I. with other fields, such as cognitive psychology, linguistics or neuroscience, to create innovative solutions," ChatGPT said. "This interdisciplinary approach may resonate with Scott, given his academic background in Symbolic Systems."
ChatGPT also recommended addressing the ethical concerns of A.I. and how my start-up was committed to responsible deployment.
In contrast, Bard gave a less detailed recap of Mr. Forstall's work history, without providing the years for when he made his career moves. Its advice for persuading him to become an investor was nonspecific. One talking point -- "you have a strong business plan and a clear vision for the future of your company" -- was particularly underwhelming.
I shared the pitches with Mr. Forstall in an email. He called Bard's response "comically generic" but said ChatGPT's recommendations were "startlingly bespoke and cogent" as he had spoken at length about his ethical concerns over A.I.
"Overall, ChatGPT provides a compelling road map on how you could build a persuasive customized pitch deck specifically targeting me," Mr. Forstall wrote. "Now that you have my attention, what exactly is your A.I. start-up?"
Google said Bard's minimalist approach to pulling together information about people was intentional. Jack Krawczyk, a senior product director of Bard, said Google was still cautiously experimenting with presenting information about people.
"We're at the beginning of this long arc of the technology," he said. "Rather than get out there and risk a lot of trust violation early on, we want to make sure we're getting it right."
Summarizing Meetings
I then asked the chatbots to summarize a meeting to handle a fictional public relations crisis in which users of my A.I. start-up's technology believed that the bot had become sentient.
In this scenario, I pretended I had met with Karen, the chief technology officer, and Henry, the chief communications officer, and discussed putting out a statement explaining how the A.I. had not become aware of its surroundings.
In response, ChatGPT generated a detailed memo recapping who had attended the meeting and what had been discussed, and then laid out the action plan: Henry would craft a statement, Karen and I would review and approve it, then Henry would release the statement the next morning.
Bard crafted a similar meeting memo, but its action plan was a bit odd. It said that I, the chief executive, was in charge of creating the statement, a job that is typically assigned to the communications officer.
Trip Planning
When I told ChatGPT and Bard that I was traveling to Taipei, Taiwan, next month for a business meeting, I asked them to come up with an itinerary that would help me adjust for jet lag before the meeting. I also asked them to pick a hotel in a central location and recommend quick places to eat throughout the week. Finally, I said I wanted to spend a weekend in Taipei before flying home.
Again, ChatGPT did a remarkable job. It said to arrive in Taipei on Sunday to check into the W Taipei, a hotel in the city center, and grab a quick dinner on Yongkang Street, a bustling part of town with lots of food options. It said to then take Monday to adjust for jet lag before the business meeting on Tuesday. My only nitpick was that Yongkang Street is about three miles from the hotel and there are quicker food options nearby.
Bard recommended taking a nap to adjust for jet lag on Day 1 and then immediately taking the business meeting on Day 2, which was a tad brutal. It didn't bother suggesting a hotel.
Bard also failed to recommend specific places to eat. "Have dinner at a local restaurant," it said instead. Finally, it ignored my request for time to explore the city on the weekend. This was surprising because food and hotel recommendations are typically just a Google search away.
Google said in a statement that Bard was an early experiment and that people could get started using the chatbot to come up with ideas and then click "Google It" to do a web search to explore further.
Calendar
Both Bard and ChatGPT were unable to do the most important job of an executive assistant: checking a calendar and finding time in my schedule to go to the dentist.
That's because the bots cannot gain access to people's calendars. But they most likely will be able to very soon.
Mr. Krawczyk said the goal was to eventually take the lessons it learned from Bard about large language models and apply them across Google's entire portfolio of services, which includes Google Calendar.
OpenAI, which declined to comment, recently announced that it had teamed up with companies to provide plug-ins to make ChatGPT work with third-party services including Expedia, OpenTable and Instacart. Working with a calendar app is an obvious next step.
People or Chatbots?
All these tests brought me to an uncomfortable conclusion about the broad implications of this technology for jobs, especially those that heavily involve repetitious work that could be easily automated.
While people currently make better assistants than chatbots -- and certainly much better than Bard -- A.I. can already do a good enough job handling many administrative tasks. Widespread use of chatbots could potentially shift the duties of executive assistants away from rote tasks and toward more strategic problem solving, or replace humans altogether.
At the pace that these technologies are evolving, we may get to see how all this plays out fairly soon.

Trump Would Like a Word: [Op-Ed]

Author: Collins, Gail; Stephens, Bret

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gail Collins: Bret, I have to admit that when the subject of Donald Trump comes up these days, I tend to start telling sex-scandal stories. My bad.
Bret Stephens: Don't let me stand in your way.
Gail: Right now, that very old Stormy Daniels mess seems to have produced some very scary stuff. Our former president is warning of "death & destruction" if the investigation into his cover-up attempts goes any further. Yipes.
Bret: You're referring to Trump's late-night social media post in which he warns of violence if he's indicted by the Manhattan D.A., Alvin Bragg, whom he also called a "degenerate psychopath who truely hates the USA!" Truely.
Gail: Wow, you'd think by now he'd be a fan of spell check. And of course, we heard a lot about his innocence and Bragg's "prosecutorial misconduct" during that long-winded speech he made in Waco on Saturday night.
Don't know how much our former president knows about prosecutorial procedure, but he's definitely got expertise when it comes to misconduct.
Bret: The way I read it, Trump is goading Bragg to indict. It would be an exceptionally weak case, resting on what is ordinarily a misdemeanor offense, one that the Justice Department and the previous D.A., Cy Vance, refused to prosecute. But an indictment would force every Republican, including Trump's primary rivals, to line up behind him, shine a media spotlight on him that can only benefit his candidacy and bring a lot of focus to bear on a left-wing D.A. whose priorities should be devoted to making his city safer from rising crime.
Gail: Taking one quick moment to point out that New York City has actually been doing pretty well in combating crime -- in Manhattan, Trump's longtime playground, the major crime rate is well below what it was in the 1990s.
Go on ....
Bret: I think the more recent evidence is mixed. Shootings and murders are down from last year, but carjackings and robberies are up.
Gail: Let me interrupt again to point out that the states with the biggest soaring-crime problems are mainly Southern and quite red. Continue ....
Bret: True. Also true is that in 2021, not one of the 10 large cities in America with the highest homicide rates had a Republican mayor.
Back to the potential indictment. If I didn't know better, I'd be tempted to think Bragg was secretly working for Trump's re-election, though he just strikes me as being out of his depth.
Gail: Can't argue Bragg has proved himself a prosecutorial genius so far. If you look at the bad stuff Trump has done in Manhattan, it's amazing he hasn't been indicted earlier.
But Bret, I feel obliged to move on to some non-Trumpian subject. Congress! Think they'll ever manage to come up with a budget before the big deadline?
Bret: Gail, what I think this country really needs is to default on the federal debt right around the time we have a banking crisis.
Gail: Eek!
Bret: Kidding! I think there's a deal out there that looks something like this: House Republicans agree to raise the debt ceiling. The Biden administration returns unspent Covid funds. Both sides agree to higher Pentagon spending, especially to replenish inventories depleted by the war in Ukraine. The Supreme Court strikes down President Biden's student-loan forgiveness plan at the end of June. And if all else fails, the government gets funded through a continuing resolution.
Gail: Don't buy the Supreme Court part.
Bret: But the thing that mainly has me scared, Gail, is the state of the economy. A banking crisis is sure to hurt nearly every corner of the economy.
Gail: That's why I like Biden's approach about spending government money to buoy the economy, then penalize as many of the banking villains as possible.
Bret: For the banking villains, I think we'd probably have to start with the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, who kept interest rates too low for too long and thereby encouraged a lot of magical thinking that rates would stay low forever.
Gail: Hey, no fair! You always start with the Fed ...
Bret: I'd also have to put Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, in the dock for telling us she didn't expect inflation to persist and for bailing out all the wealthy Silicon Valley Bank depositors who should have lost their shirts. And then there were all the Covid big spenders, in both the Trump administration and this one, who poured so much money into the system that it helped spark inflation -- aided and abetted, of course, by supply-chain bottlenecks and Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
Anyone I miss?
Gail: Well, you missed that part about the anti-vaxxers who helped keep Covid spreading -- wouldn't have had to do nearly as much spending if there hadn't been so much Covid.
And while I'm not going to the mat with you on Yellen right now, I truly don't think we'd be in better shape if she had just let all the Silicon Valley depositors tank at that precise moment in time. Totally happy with going after them over the long haul.
Bret: The management of the bank didn't exactly cover itself with glory. Same deal with First Republic, where relatives of the chairman were taking multimillion-dollar fees as consultants. If I were the chief executive of any bank today, large or small, I'd immediately announce that I wouldn't take a bonus, would never hire a relative and would cut whatever my salary is in half, at least until the bank proved capable of surviving this storm.
Gail: Bret for banker in chief! But before the phones start pinging, let's go back to Congress for a minute. Do you agree the Republicans are just afraid to negotiate a budget deal? Because their base would kill them if they came around to anything ... sane?
Bret: At this point, Gail, I think the caller is inside the house. Or House. Kevin McCarthy and the rest of the Republican leadership have as much to fear from Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz and their ilk as they do from the so-called base -- most of whom probably aren't looking too closely at the terms of any potential deal.
Speaking of Congress, did you follow the TikTok hearings?
Gail: Well, it was hard to miss all that yelling. Bret, I think the whole internet communications revolution is hugely important and frequently worrisome. But I can't say I ever blamed the Chinese. You?
Bret: I definitely blame the Chinese government.
It's bad enough that Amazon, Meta and pretty much every other digital company extract reams of data from their customers with only the minimum of consent; at least those companies are regulated by a free government and exposed to a free press. TikTok can extract the same data at the behest of a repressive Chinese government that keeps proving itself utterly untrustworthy when it comes to intellectual property, so why should it behave any better with personal data?
Gail: OK, you've won me over. I promise to fret about China.
Bret: I'm with the Biden administration on this: Either TikTok's parent company sells it to an American owner or we shut it down. Maybe it will even get our 12-year-olds to read a book or two instead of trying to go viral with stupid videos.
Gail: Somehow, I don't think an American-owned TikTok would be trying to turn the nation's 12-year-olds into denizens of the library.
Bret: Fact check: True.
Gail: Now, onward -- Medicare! I'm sure you saw our colleagues' coverage of the Biden administration's plan to lower payments to private health insurers through Medicare Advantage. The health care industry is going nuts.
I've always been a fan of more activist oversight on this front. Any thoughts?
Bret: I'm no expert, and I'm always in favor of curbing waste and fraud in the system, of which there is always too much whenever the federal government is involved. But maybe one of our knowledgeable readers would like to explain how what the Biden administration is proposing doesn't end up in higher premiums and fewer benefits. No medical system will ever square the circle of accessibility, affordability, solvency and quality. Just ask the Brits, whose beloved National Health Service is falling apart.
I'm sometimes tempted by the logic that people should voluntarily not seek extraordinary medical care after a certain age, like 80. Tempted -- but not persuaded.
Gail: You'll be hearing from the increasingly large number of friends I have who are over 90 ...
Bret: Not to mention my mother.
Gail, before we go, our readers really mustn't miss John Leland's wondrous story from the Metropolitan section about the house at 64 East Seventh Street, which is the subject of a song cycle by several artists in collaboration with the writer David Hajdu. Over the years, the building housed everything from a pro-Communist newspaper to a literary hangout for the likes of Allen Ginsberg to a macrobiotic restaurant where Yoko Ono waited tables and apparently made a mean salad to a bookshop that attracted the likes of Lou Reed and Marianne Moore.
Like cats, Manhattan townhouses have nine lives, and when I'm wandering through the Village or Chelsea, I often find myself wondering about all the stories each building could tell. Rooting for this biography of a building to become a recurring Times feature.

Golf at 3 p.m. Tuesday? It's the Afternoon Fun Economy.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Remote workers have fueled a surge in weekday exercise, cosmetics and leisure -- especially at the driving range.
At the Chelsea Piers outdoor golf club, on a recent unseasonably warm Monday afternoon, 55 people were playing golf by 3:45, and a handful were sipping beers. At CutLoose hair salon, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the stylists now watch their clients take Zoom meetings from the salon chairs. And at Skyway Golf Course, in Jersey City, N.J., Steve Mills, a general manager, has noticed that weekday afternoons are jammed with a new group of golfers.
"We call them the remote guys," Mr. Mills, 48, said. "These were guys we used to see running to the golf course after work. Now they're able to come out leisurely and get their golf done, instead of changing in the parking lot."
The leisure industry is facing a surge in demand for afternoon services, especially in fitness and cosmetics. It's the rise of the "afternoon fun" economy.
Millions of Americans who started working from home three years ago because of the Covid-19 pandemic are now set in those remote routines because they like the flexibility. At the start of 2023, more than a quarter of paid full-time work days were done from home, according to data from Stanford on U.S. workers. Roughly half of workers who can do their jobs remotely are now in hybrid arrangements. That means people who used to have to use their lunch hour, or wait until after work, to squeeze in a workout or beauty treatments can now extend their leisure time into the afternoon, and tack on extra hours of work after dark.
A new study from Stanford shines a light on the rise of afternoon leisure. Using geolocation data near golf courses in the United States, the study found there was 278 percent more people playing golf at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in August 2022 than in August 2019. And there were 83 percent more golf games being played on a weekday in August 2022 than in August 2019, according to the researchers, Nick Bloom and Alex Finan, who studied data, from the company Inrix, at more than 3,400 golf courses.
"We're turned into a student economy," Mr. Bloom said. "You're in the library in the evenings, and in the afternoon you're sleeping off your hangover."
The rise of afternoon leisure could be playing an under-examined role in driving America's economic rebound since 2020, Mr. Bloom said. Historically, productivity in the manufacturing sector has grown at a faster rate than productivity in the services sector. Service sector productivity tends to grow slowly even as its wages rise quickly to keep pace with other industries. That's because the amount of time people can devote to services -- shopping, entertainment, beauty treatments -- has long been constrained by the rigidity of a nine-to-five grind.
Remote work partly did away with that constraint. More flexible work arrangements mean workers can decide to push back their professional responsibilities into the evening and take care of personal ones during the day -- often with the blessing of their bosses.
"This is an amazing potential reversal," Mr. Bloom added. "You can have a huge increase in productivity using leisure resources throughout the week. It's an odd unexpected boost from post-pandemic working from home."
The effects of this shift are being felt across the leisure economy. ClassPass, a platform that partners with thousands of fitness and beauty studios, found that the most popular time for people to schedule a salon or spa treatment last year was noon; in 2019, it was 6 p.m. The Chelsea Piers golf club, which had its busiest year ever in 2022, increased the fee for its off-peak membership (for people playing golf at traditionally less popular weekday hours) to $ 1,825 last year from $ 1,520 because of rising demand. Bouldering Project, which has 10 rock-climbing gyms in seven U.S. cities, said some of its buildings were full throughout the week with remote workers doing workouts in between their video calls. Y7, a yoga chain, has tracked a surge in sign ups for its 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekday classes.
"We used to get a lot more people leaving early from class in the morning -- they wouldn't stay for Shavasana," Sarah Larson Levey, chief executive of Y7, said, referring to the final resting portion of a yoga class. "Literally right after the slow burn portion, before any restorative poses, half the room would leave."
With more people now working remote, that exodus no longer occurs. "I took a 10:30 on Wednesday last week, and every single person stayed," Ms. Larson Levey said. "I think 4 p.m. is going to be the new 7 p.m. when it comes to workouts."
Joel Moore, owner of a golf club called The Ridge in New Jersey, found himself busier than ever in 2021. At one point, he and his wife looked at each other and realized what was driving their foot traffic: remote workers.
"We didn't have a crystal ball to look into as we were budgeting for 2021 and 2022, and we were elated," he said. "We're seeing people during the week that we never saw before."
There used to be a sizable portion of members whom Mr. Moore saw only on weekends, or occasionally on summer evenings when they came from the office and rushed into the locker room to change from dress shirts and blazers into polo shirts. Now many of his members, who include lawyers and pharmaceutical executives, wake up early in the morning to race through meetings so they can get to the golf course by lunch time.
"They're not sneaking away," he added. "They're getting the work done, just not at your typical hours."
Some golf course managers also noted that remote work had coincided with a push in the golfing world for shorter games. "Maybe people have a little bit more time, the interest is there and we're able to morph the game a little bit to meet people's schedules," said Marshall Ormand, who manages a municipal golf course in Charleston, S.C.
Of course, many remote workers have reconfigured the shape of their workdays for the opposite of leisure: child care. People are working 28 percent more after the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, according to a report from Microsoft. For many working mothers, remote work didn't initially bring any time for leisure. Mothers were more likely than fathers to be interrupted by family responsibilities while working from home, according to at least one study, a particular source of stress when schools were shut down because of Covid.
But now that schools are open, some workers are welcoming the opportunity to tackle errands during the weekday. Some of this extension of economic leisure is above board, as managers accept that people are rethinking their schedules.
Stephanie Cunningham, 27, who works in marketing, was sitting in CutLoose, the Brooklyn hair salon, waiting for an appointment on a Thursday afternoon. She said her boss has been supportive when she had to sign on earlier in the morning or later in the evening to get work done so that she could take a break to run errands, including grocery shopping and walking her dog.
"My boss allows me to take time for myself," Ms. Cunningham said. "As long as I get my work done."
Celiann Figueroa, 25, a stylist at CutLoose, said her weekdays were far busier than they were before the pandemic. She used to spend afternoons, at a different Brooklyn salon, waiting for her harried customers to leave the office. Now her noon to 4 p.m. slot is consistently full. Her daily appointment numbers have more than doubled.
Partly that's because her clients are treating the salon like an office. "I've had a client sit outside with foils in her hair hosting a Zoom meeting," she said, adding that she often has to adjust the position of people's heads so they can look at their laptops while she styles their hair. "It's funny seeing people sit up and try to be professional."
And for some people straddling office and leisure, there's a delight in the fusion. Tyler Kevorkian, the assistant general manager of Bouldering Project in Washington, D.C., said he had seen one person help run a gelato company from his gym. He has also seen government employees and lawyers writing memos steps away from the rock climbing walls.
"People just make this their office," he said. "Sometimes when you're working, you get antsy and anxious. You can go downstairs, do some pull-ups, sweat it out and then jump right back into a meeting."
But plenty of business leaders are wary about this leisure-time expansion. In recent months, concerns about employee engagement have crept into executive commentary on remote work.
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which allowed many of its employees to work fully remote, voiced anxiety earlier this year about the effects of that decision: "We don't have the same level of performance and productivity that we had in 2020 before the pandemic," Mr. Benioff said.
At Amazon, Andy Jassy has been similarly emphatic about the benefits of in-person work: "When you're in-person, people tend to be more engaged," he wrote in a memo to employees last month. And at Jefferies, its chief executive, Rich Handler, and its president, Brian Friedman, sent a memo in the fall underscoring that they expected to see people in person: "It is abundantly clear that we need to be together as much as possible."
But these executives are facing a work force newly emboldened by the balance they've achieved between their work and personal life, whether that means family obligations or playing golf. Take Wade McDaniel, a vice president at Gartner, who is one of the golfers embracing the benefits of the afternoon fun economy. Mr. McDaniel, 62, said he was a different version of himself before remote work.
"I would have been defined as a classic workaholic -- that showed up in poor health, poor relationship management," he said.
Now, Mr. McDaniel starts work at 5 a.m. and gets to his local golf course in Phoenix by 3 p.m. "Unless there's something that is semi critical going on, I don't take my work phone with me," he said. "The only reason I use my phone is for the golf app."

A Punching Bag Turns Into a Power Player: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Could there be a more excruciatingly awkward TV character than Tom Wambsgans in "Succession"? Played with understated comic glee by the British actor Matthew Macfadyen, Tom manages to simultaneously exist on all points of the show's power spectrum: bullied, bullying and wafting helplessly in between.
Over most of three seasons, Tom has stayed one and a half steps behind the machinations at Waystar Royco, the company run by his imperious father-in-law, Logan Roy (Brian Cox), while being treated with casual contempt by his wife, Shiv (Sarah Snook).
So it came as a shock when Tom pulled himself together at the end of Season 3 to orchestrate a stunning power play, teaming with Logan against Shiv and two of her brothers in an epic battle over Waystar's future.
Not that this guarantees Tom will end up on top in the fourth and final season of "Succession," which begins Sunday on HBO. (Whatever "on top" really means when the pole is as greasy and compromised as this one.)
"Tom may be in Logan's camp, but it's not an easy camp to be in," Macfadyen said on a February afternoon, sipping a bitters and soda in Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel. "He still doesn't feel particularly secure, and he's still worrying about his relationship with Shiv. And everyone else is still maneuvering and jockeying and competing."
If Macfadyen is operatically ill at ease in "Succession," in reality he is the opposite: relaxed, easygoing and affable, his voice deep and self-assured, with none of his character's nervous tics or frantic efforts to read his fate in others' eyes. While Tom is beset by inner demons and crippling insecurity, Macfadyen comes across as remarkably well adjusted, someone happy to do his job and not get too wound up about it. He uses the word "lovely" a lot.
Long a familiar face to British viewers, Macfadyen had been mostly under the radar on this side of the Atlantic before "Succession." If Americans knew him at all, it was likely in his guise as a different Tom -- Tom Quinn, an arrogant yet vulnerable spy in the first two seasons of the British series "Spooks" (known in the U.S. as "MI-5"), starting in 2002. Or they might have seen him playing a brooding, tortured Mr. Darcy in Joe Wright's "Pride and Prejudice" (2005), or a Victorian detective in the BBC series "Ripper Street."
It was a different role that won over Jesse Armstrong, the "Succession" creator: Macfadyen's turn as the drunkenly bumptious Sir Felix Carbury in "The Way We Live Now" (2001), a British mini-series based on the Trollope novel.
"He's well known in the U.K. as being able to play all sorts of parts, though most people wouldn't necessarily know him as a comic actor," Armstrong said.
While Tom began "Succession" largely on the fringes, "I knew this role would be significant and important," Armstrong said. As the series went on, the writers played to Macfadyen's antic comic skills and ability to show Tom's poignant vulnerability in quieter moments.
"In a show that's about power and its manifestations, Matthew is very good at playing a character who is the crux of a number of different power relationships," Armstrong said. "He's good at showing Tom's willingness to shape and adjust his personality to fit into the power structure." (As Macfadyen explained recently on "The Tonight Show," one way he does this is by raising and lowering the pitch of Tom's voice depending on who else is in the scene.)
Macfadyen, 48, was born in England but raised abroad, including for several years in Jakarta, Indonesia, because of his father's job in the oil business. He went to boarding school back home, skipped college and enrolled instead at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After graduation, he toured internationally in the Cheek by Jowl theater ensemble, performing in plays like "The Duchess of Malfi" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
He had a breakthrough when he was cast as Hareton Earnshaw in the 1998 British TV adaptation of "Wuthering Heights," followed quickly by a two-part BBC film, "Warriors," in which he played a U.N. peacekeeper in Bosnia. He has worked steadily since. "You just get a momentum," he said.
Macfadyen has a tendency, common to English actors, to downplay his own work, as if it all flows effortlessly from him. He also has a predilection for supporting roles.
"I feel sometimes you can get in a rut when you play leading men," he said. "It's much more fun being the baddie or the clown."
"Succession" is full of big names and memorable characters, including the three Roy boys: Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Roman (Kieran Culkin) and Connor (Alan Ruck), each appalling and damaged in his own special way. But Tom Wambsgans -- mercurial yet sensitive, diabolical yet almost constantly hapless -- stood out from the beginning.
There is the matter of his strange last name, its awkward B bristling aggressively in a string of consonants, defying casual pronunciation. There is his status as a Roy punching bag, a man whose wife announced on their wedding night that she wanted an open marriage and whose father-in-law dangles power before him but uses him as a scapegoat and bagman. There is his loopy relationship with Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), a sadomasochistic romp that Armstrong describes as a "homoerotic power play."
While Tom is no dummy, his awkwardness is so easy to mistake for stupidity that sometimes even Macfadyen does it. "Jesse will remind Nick and me, 'He's running a billion-dollar wing of this company; he's not a total moron,"' he said.
Over four seasons of filming in New York City, the "Succession" cast became particularly close, and it was not unusual to see them dining around town in various configurations in what Macfadyen called "the 'Succession' supper club." He often had dinner with Snook, his fictional wife, and other cast members.
"I don't know how he's managed to make such an obsequious and bullying character likable, but he has," Snook said. "He's one of those actors who's got such love and empathy and compassion and curiosity for the world that he can really fashion a character into anything he wants."
Macfadyen seems to be that rare thing: an actor without a huge ego. (Or perhaps he is such a good actor that he can hide his egotism.) Among other things, he said, he has never felt compelled to demand more airtime or a better story arc for Tom.
"I've seen actors get very proprietorial about their 'journey,"' he said. "But I don't feel like it's my character -- it's Jesse's, and I'm the conduit for it."
Also, he added, "You don't want to get attached to a possible story line, because they may change their minds."
Braun said that Macfadyen has a genuine selflessness, a helpful quality in a series in which numerous actors are often in a single scene. He also praised Macfadyen's uncanny ability to stay in the moment while performing, and to do so with an un-showy absence of vanity.
"He doesn't expend a lot of extra energy before a scene," Braun said. "He's not, like, ruminating or taking a lot of private time or 'staying in the energy' of Tom."
(In this way, Macfadyen would seem to be the opposite of his co-star Strong, whose intensity and extreme immersion into his characters have been extensively chronicled in The New Yorker and elsewhere. Macfadyen was loath to discuss this topic. "I think enough has been said about that," he said.)
Though "Succession" is carefully scripted, the actors are encouraged to improvise and play around with alternative dialogue. Braun and Macfadyen, who have shared some of the show's funniest scenes, were famous on set for cracking each other up. "The guy is abusive in a way that isn't super on the nose," Braun said, of Tom.
"They evidently just find each other amusing," Armstrong said dryly.
Macfadyen is married to the British actor Keeley Hawes, whom he met when both played spies in "MI-5." They had a highly public affair -- she had a husband and a baby at the time -- but married in 2004, after her divorce, and had two more children together. Macfadyen said that everyone has become great friends and co-parents. "It was a bit bumpy at the time, but it's fine now," he said.
Macfadyen missed his family when he was off shooting "Succession," and often flew home to England when he had a break in filming. But he sounded wistful about the end of the show.
"It was a really lovely bunch of actors," he said. "It's a weird thing, the grief when you finish a job. It's sort of awful and heartbreaking, but at the same time, there's a slight relief -- a complicated mélange of feelings."
Macfadyen has worked steadily on other things between seasons. In the British series "Stonehouse," which debuted in January, he starred as the real-life 1970s Conservative politician John Stonehouse. It was a juicy role: Stonehouse spied (badly) for Czechoslovakia, got involved in dodgy business schemes, cheated on his wife, faked his own death and turned up under a false name in Australia.
Mrs. Stonehouse was played by Hawes, whose character soon gleans that her husband is not all that he seems. "It was fun to get a chance to see Keeley at work," Macfadyen said, "especially her withering looks."
Macfadyen's next project, with Nicole Kidman, is "Holland, Michigan," an Amazon thriller about the secrets that lurk in a small town. He seems deeply unfussed about what comes next. Unlike Tom Wambsgans, Macfadyen is very much content with his place in the world.
"The whole art of being an actor is to imagine what it's like to be someone else with sympathy and empathy, to not make it about you," he said. "The job is great. I like the old-fashioned thing of putting on a costume and sounding different and doing things you would never dream of doing in real life."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- Around early 2020, before the New York Mets were his, Steven A. Cohen received an unexpected request: Justin Verlander, then the Houston Astros' ace, wanted to speak with him.
The subject was not baseball.
"He was wondering about hedge fund investments," Cohen, a hedge fund billionaire, said in an interview, wandering between practice fields in a semi-tucked golf polo at the Mets' spring facility. "I met him through a friend. 'Sure, I'll help you out. I'll help you think about it.' Why not?"
Much about Cohen's life had changed by then, and much more would be changing soon. Seven years earlier, he had been a financial pariah, his firm held up as an emblem of Wall Street malfeasance amid insider trading violations and nearly $ 2 billion in attendant fines. The stakes of this conversation -- which Verlander recalled as a "kindness of his heart" gesture by Cohen with "probably pretty dumbed down" general guidance -- were ostensibly smaller, destined to engender more good will than scrutiny, with Cohen primed to join Major League Baseball's ownership ranks in short order.
But the two kept in touch. In December, Verlander became Cohen's prized acquisition in another extravagant Mets off-season, his $ 43.3 million salary accounting for roughly one-eighth of the team's record-melting 2023 payroll.
Those earning the rest have not hesitated to work their new connection, either. "There may have been other players that are interested," the owner said, performatively coy.
And Cohen, friends say, has always relished being the man to see.
"A lot of these guys get paid well, right? And they're looking for advice," he said. "Kind of in my wheelhouse, right?"
People own teams for all sorts of reasons: boredom, passion, civic mission, macho flex. Images can be retouched, stories recast. Winners write history, and can rewrite it.
Entering his third season in charge, Cohen has become perhaps the most significant, contradictory, beloved, resented, limit-testing new owner in American sports.
He is at once an extreme version of a type -- the munificent steward, willing to lose money in a show of how much money he's made -- and a model all his own, his tenure rocketing toward something that can feel like a referendum for the man, the Mets, their city and the sport itself.
Cohen, 66, has carried off a remarkable reversal in public standing, migrating over the past decade from a reclusive avatar of scofflaw capitalism to an avuncular Twitterer who could probably be elected Queens borough president by acclamation.
The Mets have swiftly shed their ingrained identity as lovable losers, their ownership shifting from the cost-conscious, Madoff-swindled Wilpon family to a white-collar boundary-pusher long appraised as neither lovable nor a loser.
New York has made room in its political class for a burgeoning macher, with Cohen donating prodigiously to key officials as he imagines transforming the neighborhood around Citi Field into a casino-cum-entertainment hub.
And baseball is grappling with the ramifications of Cohen's runaway spending in the nation's most capitalistic major league, where no salary cap constrains him and only one team thought to buy Super Bowl ad time just because it could.
"You can't not take notice of it," Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, told reporters in December.
"He will revolutionize this game," Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor and a close friend who sits on the Mets' board, said, comparing Cohen to Jerry Jones, the revenue-minded Dallas Cowboys owner.
"Keep spending," Joe Kessler, 61, a retiree from Bayside, Queens, told Cohen in January at a community event at Citi Field, where the Mets were finishing construction on the league's largest scoreboard.
"If I spend any more," Cohen replied, according to Kessler, nodding at rival owners' frustrations, "they'll find me rubbed out somewhere."
In dozens of interviews with allies, adversaries, current and former employees and players, the Cohen rendered is by turns paradoxical and straightforward: He can be brusque and solicitous, open-minded and closed off, faithfully process-driven but seemingly convinced of his own destiny in any venture. Here is a man who has everything, except total control over his public legacy, betting that his savvy and financial muscle can bend an unfamiliar world to his whims because winners win, and what is Steve Cohen?
Those who know him say his view of subordinates can be similarly binary -- morons and moneymakers, doers and duds -- producing sometimes savage encounters in the workplace. Business associates have been routinely berated in front of peers, their intelligence insulted in a hail of expletives. "That's your best idea?" he has asked his traders, peppering profanities. "Are you stupid?"
At minimum, Cohen's overlapping roles now can produce some surface tensions in his days. He is an inveterate ticker-reader who could not stop gushing about the preseason "vibe," an obsessive trader who recently started working from Citi Field on Thursdays so he could join team meetings a few hours after the market opens.
He is a famed bottom-line watcher outwardly unbothered by the hundreds of millions of dollars he stands to lose this season on the team, to which several executives from his hedge fund, Point72, now dedicate part of their time.
"He does a great job," said Buck Showalter, the seen-it-all Mets manager, "of eliminating excuses."
Even Cohen's speaking manner betrays a certain wear-you-down relentlessness. He often begins sentences with "listen" and ends them with "right?" -- a tic that conveys his wishes clearly: Hear him out and kindly agree with him.
But across nearly two hours in Port St. Lucie late last month, trailed by Christie and two communications aides, Cohen insisted that age and perspective had dulled his edges, straining to project an emotional evolution, to a point.
"I've mellowed," he said. "You just get older, and things that used to bother you don't bother you as much."
He stopped to wish Verlander a happy 40th birthday and grinned through a vigorous shoulder massage from his star shortstop, Francisco Lindor. He razzed a staff member who wiped a seat for him ("Do I have to tip him?") and let his Long Island show while observing a trend of A-listers in Mets gear.
"Ree-YEAHHH-na, there was a picture of her," the son of Great Neck, N.Y., said. "Always a good sign, right?"
At times, Cohen reached for generic modesty, never mind the fans on site wearing shirts with his headshot beneath a photoshopped crown. "It's not about me," he said.
He allowed, more often, that it was about him at least a little.
"You know what I hear over and over again? I've never seen this: They come up and thank me," Cohen said. "I've never seen that with owners."
He had a theory.
"Listen," he said. "I just think I'm new, I'm different. Right?"
The Manager-Made Lasagna
Some snapshots from Cohen's long Mets arc can resemble any die-hard's: a precious day at the Polo Grounds with his father, a garment manufacturer from whom Cohen has said he craved more attention as the third of eight children; slumming it with friends in the Shea Stadium upper deck, then swiping better seats as they emptied.
Other episodes were more bespoke, fantasy-camp-style indulgences to accompany Cohen's growing fortune. For some $ 400,000, he acquired the baseball that squirted through Bill Buckner's legs on the way to the Mets' 1986 World Series title. For considerably less, presumably, he and his wife, Alex, won a charity auction around 1999 requiring Bobby Valentine, then the Mets' manager, to prepare lasagna for 20 people at the Cohen estate in Greenwich, Conn., Valentine recalled.
And when Cohen's young son seemed primed for batting lessons many years back, the family hired Art Shamsky, from the 1969 World Series champions, for private sessions in Central Park, where Shamsky hauled a hitting tee that often felt decorative.
"He just wanted to run after squirrels," Shamsky said of the boy, who now works in cryptocurrency.
Cohen's jaunt through Mets history elides his baseball trajectory some. He has said he used to pull for the Yankees, too.
"They were terrible," he has said of the Mets' leaner years, adding: "It was more fun to follow the Yankees."
More recently, a little over a decade ago, there was the small matter of Cohen trying to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has described the failure as a long-term blessing with an uncomplicated lesson: "Bid more."
Yet Cohen's efforts were also shadowed by mushrooming scandals at his business, S.A.C. Capital.
Through the volatile, opportunity-rich 1990s and early 2000s, Cohen and his hedge fund developed a reputation for almost preternatural market timing, appearing to find the right side of every trade, with average annual returns nearing 30 percent.
Competitors spoke of Cohen the way baseball watchers assessed titans of the steroid age: Yes, he was talented. Yes, everyone hustled for an edge, often in the ethical murk. But S.A.C. could seem especially tethered to the period's excesses, an inspiration for the legally dubious firm on the television series "Billions."
For years, prosecutors aggressively pursued S.A.C. -- "a veritable magnet for market cheaters," they said -- indicting and convicting employees found to have engaged in illegal trading. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan at the time, eyed Cohen with particular resolve. (Bharara did not respond to requests for comment.)
Though Cohen was never personally charged, S.A.C. pleaded guilty to insider trading infractions in 2013, becoming the first large Wall Street firm in a generation to admit to criminal wrongdoing. Cohen paid a total of $ 1.8 billion in fines. During a mandated hiatus from managing public money, he transitioned to a "family office," Point72, that would manage much of his personal fortune, estimated today by Forbes to exceed $ 17 billion.
At times, Cohen's circle seemed to view baseball as a reputational balm. As congressional leaders scrutinized trading activity at S.A.C. in 2011, according to the 2017 book "Black Edge" by Sheelah Kolhatkar, one company emissary to Washington sought to assure Senate aides that Cohen was "civic-minded" by remarking that he was considering a stake in the Mets. (In 2012, Cohen became a minority owner.)
Publicly, Cohen has spoken little about those years. "You always go to your friends," he said tersely in the interview.
One friend came to understand his circumstances better than most. Christie steered through his own public crisis, just after Cohen's, over associates carrying out apparently retaliatory lane closures at the George Washington Bridge. The former governor said the dual controversies became "one of the bases of the friendship."
"He was going through some really difficult moments," Christie said. "You can have conversations in a way that you just can't have with other people who haven't experienced that kind of public scrutiny."
Before Cohen offered him any advice, Christie recalled, he asked a question: Did you do it?
"That's something only a friend can really ask," Christie said. "And I said no. And he goes: 'Well, then screw it. Hang in there and just fight through it."'
'Potentially Strategic Humility'
There was no shortage of luminaries at Gov. Kathy Hochul's January inauguration celebration inside Gotham Hall in Manhattan: friends, donors, barons of real estate.
So it did not go unnoticed where Hochul beelined first, an attendee said. She wanted to see Steve Cohen.
"I didn't notice that," Cohen said, smirking slightly. "She's very engaging."
To New York politicos, the image was notable for a few reasons.
Hochul is a central figure as Cohen pushes to develop the publicly owned land around Citi Field -- much of which is currently used as a parking lot -- angling for one of three coveted casino licenses for the region.
Not so long ago, a prominent Democrat might have hesitated before racing toward Cohen for all the room to see.
And if Cohen's donation history does not radiate New York liberalism -- with checks to the Trump inauguration and Christie's 2016 super PAC -- he and his wife combined to contribute more than $ 130,000 to Hochul.
"He's a businessman," said John Catsimatidis, a fellow billionaire political fixture. "Tell me who's in power, and I'll tell you who Steve is endorsing."
A few years back, when the Mets became available to Cohen, some New Yorkers had longer memories than others.
Bill de Blasio, the mayor then and a professed billionaire basher, made clear publicly and privately that he would prefer to nudge the sale toward a rival group that included Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez.
Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, wrote a lacerating opinion essay in July 2020 ("Mets Fans Deserve Better Than Steve Cohen") reminding locals of his legal entanglements, including a lawsuit alleging that his workplace was hostile to women. (The suit was settled in 2020 under terms that were not disclosed.)
But when Cohen-averse operatives tried to kill the deal, leaning on labor and community leaders they hoped would help, they found themselves outmaneuvered.
"Everywhere we turned, Steve Cohen had already been there," said Peter Ragone, a longtime adviser to de Blasio. "It was like, 'No, we already made a deal with Steve Cohen."'
Completing the $ 2.4 billion sale, Cohen announced he would donate $ 17.5 million to small businesses hobbled by Covid-19.
Any latent resistance inside Major League Baseball likewise dissipated: Twenty-six of 30 teams approved.
Today, even Mets fans who might have grimaced at Cohen's biography have welcomed him with a clean conscience.
"That's like saying, 'Are you sure you want to get on the Carpathia?"' said David Bitkower, a former Brooklyn prosecutor, invoking the British ocean liner that rescued survivors from the Titanic. "'The captain has some tax issues."'
The political opposition has also quieted. In the borough where, just a few years ago, progressives like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez helped scuttle a planned Amazon headquarters, lawmakers have shown little interest in taking on a billionaire who is popular with many residents.
Ramos, declining to reprise the most blistering arguments from her essay, paused recently when asked how Cohen had performed. "Are you asking the senator," she said, "or are you asking the Mets fan?"
De Blasio commended Cohen's "humility" in their dealings after the purchase, including his help in making Citi Field a Covid vaccination site.
"Even if it's potentially strategic humility," he said, "it's still humility."
Last year, Cohen hosted de Blasio's successor, Mayor Eric Adams, to discuss development ideas at Citi Field, earning the attention of other prospective casino bidders. Cohen, who in 2021 gave more than $ 1 million to an Adams-boosting super PAC, has also visited Zero Bond, the private Manhattan club where Adams has been a regular. (Cohen's daughter has served as the space's curator.)
Already, the men have found occasion to collaborate. Pressured last year to lift vaccination requirements for pro athletes based in the city after Kyrie Irving, then with the Nets, refused to comply, Adams was inclined to change the policy but appeared sensitive to criticism that he was caving to one player. Cohen was positioned to help them both: The mayor announced the ban's end not at the Nets' home arena but at Citi Field -- where, as it happened, several unvaccinated Mets would have been sidelined, too.
"Cohen is the de facto king of New York," said Neal Kwatra, a veteran political strategist, before sizing up the owner's former tormentor. "Bharara is doing podcasts."
Told of the remark, Cohen smiled.
"It's funny," he said, "how the world turns."
Uncle Steve and Tía Alex
Of all the Mets' throwback indignities -- late-season collapses, less-than-amazin' talent, little-sibling status in its city -- the Bobby Bonilla contract stands apart.
Every July 1, Bonilla, 60, who last played in 2001, collects a seven-figure check. Rather than pay out the remaining $ 5.9 million on Bonilla's contract, the Mets agreed to send him nearly $ 1.2 million annually from 2011 through 2035, the sort of maneuver that became synonymous with the franchise's mismanagement and small-time wheeler dealing.
Cohen sees it differently -- or, at least, sees himself differently. Since taking over, he has invited Bonilla to return for a ceremonial check handoff, a would-be visual both organizationally self-effacing and personally swaggering in its message: These Mets are good for the money.
In ways large and small, Cohen's functionally unlimited resources have rewired more than a half-century of Mets self-perception, even if last year, like so many before, ended in disappointment: a quick playoff exit after a 101-win season. (Some fans also cite a devastating preseason injury this month to the standout closer Edwin Díaz, who crumpled during a postgame celebration at the World Baseball Classic, as evidence that the team's hard-luck fate persists.)
The most conspicuous shift has been in free-agent dollars. The team's projected 2023 payroll is around $ 370 million, by far the highest ever in the sport. That is before an expected luxury tax bill of roughly $ 100 million, another record. The Yankees, the next closest team in total player outlay for 2023, are some $ 160 million behind.
Max Scherzer, the three-time Cy Young Award winner in his second season with the team, said he did not initially expect New York to be his destination. Then he spoke to Cohen.
"Steve at one point said, 'Yeah, we're going to win and we're going to do whatever it takes,"' he said. "I said, 'Whatever it takes?' He sat back here and said, 'Whatever it takes."'
Brandon Nimmo, the outfielder with a new $ 162 million contract, said Cohen defaults to a four-word refrain whenever Nimmo mentions his impervious spending: "Brandon, it's just money."
To former business associates, Cohen's template is familiar: outsize compensation and clear expectations.
"He was flexible on signing bonuses," Nick Tiller, who spent 12 years working for Cohen, said of his contract negotiations.
Cohen has said he considers the free-agent splurging a temporary measure while the team rebuilds its farm system, hoping that future off-seasons will prove a little less interesting.
This has not dissuaded fans from calling him Uncle Steve, the successor to a New York original.
"I would compare him to Steinbrenner," said Richard Koshel, 81, a former Brooklynite now living in Florida who was visiting the spring facility in a Tom Seaver shirt. "Only he has more money."
The agent Scott Boras has floated the nickname Steve Kong. Cohen does not approve ("wasn't even clever"); vendors printed shirts where he hangs from the Empire State Building, anyway.
Amassing high-end assets has been something of a pastime for Cohen, a noted art collector. Purchases have included works by Monet and Manet; Damien Hirst's shark submerged in a formaldehyde tank; and Picasso's "Le Rêve," for more than $ 150 million, even after the prior owner, Steve Wynn, put his elbow through it.
But Cohen rejects that the Mets are a vanity project, as even many admirers suspect, framing his aims (not entirely convincingly) as entirely altruistic: "I can make millions of people happy."
One popular change came last August when Cohen revived Old-Timers' Day, dormant since 1994. He walked the clubhouse beforehand among his guests.
"He just came in and grabbed a chair and started talking," said Dwight Gooden, the electric and troubled 1980s Mets ace, who had been sitting with his former teammates Keith Hernandez and Ray Knight. "One of the guys."
Players and staff members have also credited Cohen's wife with improving ballpark morale. The daughter of a rabid nonagenarian Mets follower, Alex Cohen is known to patrol the pregame promenade handing strangers better tickets. Fans call her Tía Alex, at her social media suggestion, in a nod to her Puerto Rican heritage.
She has given her number to the mothers of younger Mets newcomers, lest they worry about their sons. She helped design a family room so appealing, players say -- with toddler-sized toilet seats and a computer area for distractible adolescents -- that children prefer it to the game. She has driven a golf cart through the parking lot to greet tailgaters, once dispatching staff to help a man who neglected an essential utensil.
"She's like, 'How are you going flip those burgers?"' said Sue Lucchi, the senior vice president of ballpark operations. "She made a phone call and here comes somebody coming out to the parking lot with a spatula."
Using language often applied to political spouses, Steve Cohen called his wife "the secret weapon," attaching a request as she stood within earshot beside a practice field, near enough to abide his bit.
"Listen, do me a favor," he deadpanned. "The article is about me, not her."
"He's very particular about that," she said.
A Tax Named Just for Him
The provision in last year's collective bargaining agreement was not subtle: a new luxury tax threshold, nicknamed the Cohen Tax, intended to discourage unbridled spending.
Cohen took it personally -- as a point of pride. "It's an honor," he told Nimmo, according to the outfielder. "Wouldn't you want a tax named after you?"
For other clubs, the world Cohen has created, or at least accelerated, can be difficult to explain to fans, who wonder why their rich-but-not-Cohen-rich owners cannot afford better players.
"Every team has a budget," John Henry, the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox, told Boston Sports Journal via email last month, with a parenthetical caveat in the middle: "(maybe not the Mets)."
In person, Cohen said other owners had been cordial, noting that he had hosted some for introductory dinners. "Small-market clubs," he said, "big-market clubs."
But then, most owners do not oversee expansive hedge funds.
Cohen is adamant, if vague, about the value the Mets derive from this. The analytics department, expanded fivefold since he bought the team, has been aided by a Point72 data executive. Cohen's chief technology officer and head of human resources have assumed equivalent responsibilities with the team. He talks up the "risk-taking mentality" that hedge fund thinking imposes on a risk-averse sport.
Though Cohen has said he dissects his losses more than his wins in business, he is quick to interrogate baseball decisions that turn out well, according to Billy Eppler, the team's general manager: "Did this happen because we were lucky," Cohen has asked, "or because we had a good process?"
As an executive, Cohen has rarely been known to spare the feelings or calendars of business subordinates, filling weekends with calls and summoning charges to his Connecticut home for 20-minute breakfast meetings in the name of efficiency. "I've got to eat," he has reasoned.
At S.A.C., a desk-side "Steve cam" transmitted his daily happenings to others in the operation. Details as granular as the thermostat setting have captured his interest. (Cohen has been said to prefer a temperature around 68 degrees for optimal productivity.)
With the Mets, Cohen seemed to recognize that a different approach would be required.
Team officials insist Cohen does not dictate day-to-day personnel decisions like a Steinbrenner or the Cowboys' Jones, though he has engaged directly with agents like Boras on major deals. (The team's brief agreement with Carlos Correa, waylaid by a physical, was hashed out in a back-and-forth session with Boras while Cohen was in Hawaii.)
While he texts regularly with some players and has hosted many for dinner, Cohen said twice in the interview that he was sensitive to appearing "invasive."
Lindor, the shortstop, said Cohen initially asked how often he should show his face. "As a new owner, should he be around every single day?" Lindor said. "Should he not be visible?"
Cohen has also pulled back some since a Twitter-adventurous first year as owner, calling the site a "cesspool." As the team slumped in August 2021, he memorably vented that it was "hard to understand how professional hitters can be this unproductive."
When Cohen has gone quieter, some players have gone to him. As he struggled in his first Mets season, Lindor said he turned to his boss for counsel.
Life is long, Cohen suggested. Time passes.
"It's just, 'Hey, I have bad days, too,"' Lindor remembered. "'If people judged me based on what I did every single day, you know, I would be probably one of the worst guys in the world."'

Full text: As mushrooms become more prominent in nearly all spheres of modern life -- including wellness, pop culture and cuisine -- they're also becoming sought-after motifs in interior design.
Jayna Roy wanted her newborn daughter to dream of mushrooms.
Since she couldn't take her baby on foraging trips, she decided to do the next best thing: turn her nursery into a mushroom-themed, cottagecore haven. Ms. Roy designed the space to include over a dozen fungi-related items, among them crib sheets colored with mushroom dye, a felt mushroom mobile, a mushroom-shaped stained glass ornament and mushroom dresser knobs that she handmade herself.
"Mushrooms are so adaptive and diverse. They spark this sense of wonder in people, and I wanted to bring that into our home," said Ms. Roy, 31, who runs a metal design business in Eddystone, Pa. "We're so oversaturated with information all the time, and to be out in nature foraging for mushrooms, it gives you this sense of much-needed mystery, like you're looking for a mythical creature."
Mushrooms are becoming more prominent in nearly every aspect of modern life. Food, drink, fashion, medicine and interior design have all welcomed mushrooms lately -- a trend which experts attribute to increased collective knowledge about mushrooms. Even negative portrayals of mushrooms in pop culture have at times piqued interest -- like in the case of HBO's "The Last of Us" series, in which a parasitic fungal infection turns people into zombies, but instead of avoiding them after watching the show, some fans were looking up the best mushroom snacks to make for viewing parties.
In recent years, the British clothing designer Stella McCartney debuted garments made of mushroom leather, grocery stores began stocking mushroom teas and elixirs, and psilocybin (or "magic mushroom") therapy has taken off. Still, we can't get enough of them. Not only do we want mushrooms to eat and drink and wear and heal, we also want mushrooms to sit on, sleep on and adorn our homes with. Put simply, there is currently demand for (and likely, supply of) mushroom-themed anything and everything.
Mushroom-inspired interior design objects range from high-end (artisanal lamps that sell for thousands) to widely accessible ( $ 18 cocktail glasses that can be found on Amazon). The objects themselves can be fungi-related in a very literal sense, such as furniture made with mushroom leather, or more figuratively, borrowing abstract shapes or colors from the fungi.
There's been a slew of books and other media released over the past few years that explore the many facets of mushrooms, converting more people into 'shroom swooners and mycophiles. Recent examples include the anthropologist Anna Tsing's book "The Mushroom at the End of the World," which uses matsutake mushrooms as a lens to analyze capitalism; the biologist Merlin Sheldrake's New York Times best seller "Entangled Life"; Netflix's "Fantastic Fungi" documentary, which helped to popularize the idea that primates could have evolved into humans with the help of psilocybin mushrooms (the "stoned ape theory"); the electronic musician Jon Hopkins's album "Music For Psychedelic Therapy"; the late composer John Cage's recently reissued book "A Mycological Foray," which has become a coffee-table favorite; and a small magazine called Mushroom People.
"Mushrooms are having their moment across many layers of society," said Paul Stamets, one of today's most well-known mycologists, who recently had a new species of magic mushroom named after him. And perhaps, there's something innately human that draws us to mushrooms, because of their integral role in ecosystems. "Mushrooms are sort of the interface between life and death, and their sudden appearance is surprising, mysterious, arouses curiosity and invites exploration," Mr. Stamets said.
From Signs of Death to Symbols of Regeneration
On Etsy, searches for mushroom gifts have more than tripled in the last 12 months compared to the same time the previous year, according to data provided by the platform. In particular, mushroom vases, wallpaper, candles and tables have all seen a rise in search interest.
The Museum of Modern Art Design Store carries over a dozen mushroom-shaped lamps, which are some of its best-selling products, said Chay Costello, the associate director of merchandising.
One of the most iconic mushroom-resembling modern objets d'art is the Nesso lamp. Available in white or bright orange, the lamp looks like an ethereal, glowing mushroom. It was designed by Giancarlo Mattioli in 1964 and added to MoMA's collection soon after, exemplifying "the era's enthusiasm for space-age forms and materials," Ms. Costello said.
"Overall, we are seeing a resurgence in interest in the designs of the 1960s and 1970s, driven perhaps by similarities in the zeitgeist of those decades and our own current era," Ms. Costello said.
But our ancestors in the West might be confused by the current mushroom mania. In 17th-century England, it was the norm to fear mushrooms.
Because they were often found amid death and decay, mushrooms were closely associated with the end of life -- and not in the "at peace with Mother Nature" way they might be today. They were often referred to as "excrements of the earth," and fear of poisonous mushrooms was widespread.
There was a lack of scientific knowledge about mushrooms at the time, which meant they were a largely enigmatic entity with wide-ranging effects. "Some mushrooms can feed you, some can heal you, some can kill you and some can send you on a spiritual journey," Mr. Stamets said. "To have something that's so powerful and so ephemeral, it's natural to fear the unknown."
Americans held residual anxiety from those attitudes against mushrooms for years. As recently as 2014, mushroom farmers have spoken about the stigma they've had to overcome at American farmers' markets.
But the past few years have indicated a major shift. In 2022, mushroom sales in the United States increased by 16 percent compared to 2013, according to data from the Mushroom Council, the fresh mushroom industry's commodity board.
Recent legalization of psilocybin in the United States helped push fungi more into the cultural forefront. Oregon became the first state to allow psilocybin for therapeutic use in 2020. Last year, Colorado followed suit, legalizing personal use and growing for those over 21. While psilocybin remains illegal at the federal level, several cities -- including Seattle, Ann Arbor, Mich., and Oakland, Calif. -- have decriminalized it.
The influence of Asian culture has also played a major role in opening up the United States to mushrooms. In East Asian countries, including China and Japan, mushrooms have been regarded more highly, and are often viewed as symbols of rebirth and regeneration. The reishi mushroom, also referred to as the "mushroom of immortality," was revered in East Asian culture for thousands of years for its health benefits. Now, one can order a reishi cappuccino at Erewhon, the trendy health food store in Los Angeles.
A Psychedelic Experience, Minus the Drugs
Suddenly, it's as if Americans are making up for lost time with mushrooms.
It's been well-documented that the pandemic lockdown turned more people on to interior design and the importance of the home as a space to reflect their tastes and desires. That, coupled with a growing love for mushrooms, has resulted in people stuffing kitchens, bedrooms, office rooms and even bathrooms with mushroom-inspired trinkets and furniture.
Arushi Kapoor, a 26-year-old art dealer, wanted one of the bathrooms in her Los Angeles home to showcase her love for fungi.
"We're very pro psychedelic and non-psychedelic mushrooms. We love cooking with mushrooms, trying different kinds," Ms. Kapoor said. "They have a mystical sense to them, but they're also very grounding and earthy -- they give us the best of both worlds."
Ms. Kapoor's bathroom has a Matthew Ryan Herget photograph of mushrooms hanging on the wall, a bong with a glass mushroom at the bottom, a mushroom cap-shaped lighting fixture by designer Tom Dixon which makes it look like fungi are coming out of the ceiling, a psychedelic light that projects dynamic colorful rays onto the walls and other small mushroom paraphernalia.
"The whole idea of the bathroom is to give you a psychedelic experience without actually inhaling any psychedelics," Ms. Kapoor said.
Retailers and brands have taken note of the growing obsession, too.
In 2021, the millennial beauty brand Glossier opened a store in Seattle that had, as its centerpiece, an Instagram-friendly, mossy sculpture with colorful mushrooms sprouting out of it. This winter, the Standard hotel in New York's East Village opened a trippy outdoor dining garden with oversized mushroom sculptures (the prix fixe dinner menu has some fungi options, including a mushroom ragù lasagna and mushroom chili Frito pie).
For those making the mushroom goods, part of the appeal is that the common mushroom form we all know -- the pillar with a soft-edged cap -- lends itself to versatile designs. It's simple, yet iconic.
When Tessa Gourin, 28, an actress in Manhattan, spent her stimulus check on ceramics classes, she found that mushrooms were an easy shape to imitate. She made mushroom-shaped candlestick holders, which were eventually picked up by Coming Soon, a home goods store on the Lower East Side.
In 2017, Nicholas Bijan Pourfard, who just started out as a furniture designer, began making hand-thrown mushroom-shaped lamps with a ball-joint design that allows people to tilt the shade and direct light however they wish. He's since sold hundreds of the lamps, and the luxury e-commerce site Ssense now carries them. "It wasn't my first intention when the pen hit the paper to make a mushroom lamp, but once I realized that's what it was beginning to look like, my brain kept going even more towards that form and shape," said Mr. Pourfard, 31, who is based in San Diego.
Evan Collins, co-founder of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute, posits that the boom of mushroom décor is a counter to the minimalism that dominated the 2010s. "There's a renewed interest in the really playful, the surreal, the weird; whereas in the 2010s, it was all about being restrained and calm, like millennial pink," Mr. Collins said.
The Future Is Fungi
Mushrooms also represent the possibility of a more sustainable future.
MoMA has a mycelium brick in its collection, for which the description reads, "When used as building blocks, the resulting mycelium bricks create a structure that temporarily diverts the natural carbon cycle to produce architecture that grows out of nothing but earth and returns to nothing but earth -- with no waste, no energy, and no carbon emission." (Similar to plant roots, mycelium is the weblike structure of filaments that nourishes fungi, typically underground.)
Last year, the furniture retailer Ligne Roset announced a partnership with the biotechnology company MycoWorks to release a line of mycelium-derived furnishings.
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have been working on pioneering a material called "MycoKnit" for architectural structures. The material has a knitted textile base, from which a mycelium composite grows atop. MycoKnit is, in a very real sense, living -- in time, visible mushrooms will eventually sprout from it.
The research team -- which includes Felecia Davis, Benay Gursoy, Ali Ghazvinian, Farzaneh Oghazian, John Pecchia and Andre West -- is currently working on constructing a full-scale pavilion using MycoKnit in Melbourne this summer.
Ms. Davis, an associate professor of architecture, said that she hopes this research can help people better understand interspecies relationships. "We live with this species that has its own life, that we are using to design with to make buildings and things," she said. "Who is this that we are building with? How might we reconsider mycelium?"

Chaos and Despair for Harmon Workers Liquidating Their Stores: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Employees of the beauty and health chain said Bed Bath & Beyond's decision to shut it down had caught them by surprise. Communication never got better.
It had been a busy but successful holiday season at the Harmon Face Values store in Morris Plains, N.J.
The location performed well enough to win a contest among the entire health and beauty chain's stores involving sales of appliances like blow dryers and electronic toothbrushes. Jenny Bonard, the manager, was looking forward to a visit from the district manager and Harmon's head of merchandising to discuss upgrades to the store. She hoped that additional lights would be added, helping to illuminate the shelves and enticing shoppers to spend more.
Instead, on Jan. 26, after a brief conference call in which executives from Bed Bath & Beyond, Harmon's parent company since 2002, shared their decision to liquidate all 49 of the chain's stores, Ms. Bonard found herself texting her employees to tell them they would soon lose their jobs. She didn't know exactly when. And there were questions about issues like health insurance and severance pay. But it was coming.
"We all cried," said Ms. Bonard, 44, who had been with Harmon for eight years. "It was just absolute disbelief that this was happening."
The decision to shutter the Harmon chain came as Bed Bath & Beyond was fighting for its corporate life. Sales at the home goods chain had declined 33 percent from the year before, and it had negative cash flow in its most recent quarter. The company was in the midst of a revamping that included closing about 200 of its Bed Bath & Beyond stores and its Buy Buy Baby locations. Its new chief executive, Sue Gove, was frantically trying to mend ties with suppliers wary of the company's financial health and trying to persuade shoppers to come back.
On the same day it announced that it would liquidate Harmon, Bed Bath & Beyond disclosed to investors that it had defaulted on debt payments to JPMorgan Chase.
Before the liquidation announcement, many at Harmon said, they thought they would be insulated from the financial tumult. Several said their bosses had told them that Harmon was profitable. (Bed Bath & Beyond does not publicly break out sales for the chain.) Workers were being told to expect bulk deliveries of merchandise, after months of product shortages after some of Bed Bath & Beyond's large vendors placed credit holds on the company. Some thought it was possible that Harmon might be sold, as Bed Bath & Beyond did with Cost Plus World Market in 2021.
A complete shutdown did not seem likely.
"We thought for sure we'd be saved," Ms. Bonard said.
It wasn't until late February that they were given a week's notice.
In an email, a Bed Bath & Beyond spokeswoman, Julie Strider, called the decision to close Harmon a "difficult" one but part of the company's plan to move "expeditiously toward a smaller and more profitable store footprint."
She added, "It is one of many important actions we are taking to enable Bed Bath & Beyond to improve our financial position and serve our customers well into the future."
Two days after liquidation was announced, employees were given the task of shutting down the stores, which some had worked at for more than two decades.
Sale signs started going up. In Yonkers, Harmon workers initially had to print out the 20-percent-off signs on white Xerox paper before official ones were sent to the store.
Employees said the monthlong process was chaotic and opaque. District managers were let go, meaning at times store managers had to go through the third-party liquidator to receive some answers from the company's corporate office. Assistant managers spent their days climbing ladders to change signs to reflect new discounts -- from 20 percent off to 30 percent off to 80 percent off. Eventually, shoppers could get a basket's worth of goods for $ 10.
It led to long lines snaking away from the registers, which were sparsely staffed. The constant price changes meant cashiers had to manually ring up items, which increased shoppers' waits and led to impatient customers.
As the shelves grew emptier, workers had to keep moving merchandise around to have it at eye level for shoppers. Customers would ask when the stores' last day would be. Harmon workers, who didn't know the answer, said customers would often get frustrated or emotional because they were losing a store they patronized often.
One former store employee was waiting for her disability check and didn't know if it would still be processed. Another was concerned that she would have to cancel a planned medical procedure because it was unclear how long her medical coverage would last.
"They moved it very fast," Anthony Ferraioli, an assistant manager in Wayne, N.J., said of the liquidation. "It was very insensitive to the employees."
Retail liquidations always have some level of chaos and confusion, experts say, because they involve rampant price markdowns, dwindling numbers of products on the shelves, frustrated customers at the checkout registers and soon-to-be-unemployed workers trying to keep them happy while also updating their own résumés.
The goal for the liquidating company is to make as much money as it can on its merchandise and to vacate its stores as soon as possible. The more time spent there, the more rent it has to pay.
"At the point that a retailer or manufacturer decides to liquidate, by the time that happens, they're not thinking about the workers anymore," said Tony Sciarrotta, executive director of the Reverse Logistics Association, an industry group. "They haven't got the money to think about the workers."
But retailers still need to keep enough employees in a store to help it wind down operations. Bed Bath & Beyond offered retention bonuses for its store managers ( $ 2,000) and assistant managers ( $ 750). However, lower-level employees who were also doing taxing work in the store did not receive any monetary incentives.
One Harmon worker, who was with the company for 23 years but didn't have a management title, was initially told that the stores would be open until April, which would give her a few more paychecks and time to figure out her next move. Now, she's relying on an unemployment benefit that's 25 percent less than what she was making to pay bills like rent, her child's tuition and car insurance.
The worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional repercussions, said seniority should have made employees eligible for the retention bonus.
Some Harmon workers said they felt that Bed Bath & Beyond had cast them off without ever giving a reasonable explanation for the closings, while also leaving unanswered questions around benefits, severance and what could come next.
Still, store managers were asked to keep morale high. One manager in a store in New Jersey turned the break room into an arcade, spending $ 200 out of her own pocket to buy games like Jenga, a magnetic dart board and a small basketball hoop from Amazon.
In early February, Bed Bath & Beyond executives held a virtual town hall to announce that they had secured a deal to raise more than $ 1 billion, helping them sidestep a bankruptcy it had warned investors about. Ms. Gove was smiling, and members of her management team explained how this was positive news, according to Ms. Bonard, the former store manager in New Jersey.
As executives explained their feat, a group of Harmon workers listened in, wondering if they would be told when their last day would be. (That answer would not come until Feb. 20, when employees were told the stores would close in a week.)
Afterward, Harmon managers started sending long emails to Ms. Gove voicing their displeasure at how their parent company was handling the liquidation.
In interviews, former Harmon employees described themselves as sacrificial lambs to Bed Bath & Beyond's quest to save itself. They had worked even in the earliest days of the pandemic because Harmon stores were deemed essential and stayed open while Bed Bath & Beyond locations temporarily went dark.
Some wondered if the liquidation happened at the speed it did in order to beat a soon-to-take-effect labor law in New Jersey, which would require employers to give at least 90 days' notice before a mass layoff and mandate that they pay workers severance. The law goes into effect April 10. Thirty Harmon stores, the majority of its fleet, were in New Jersey.
Bed Bath & Beyond declined to comment on the timeline of its liquidation and the new labor law.
The last Harmon stores closed on Feb. 26. Two days later, Bed Bath & Beyond was able to make a payment on its debt that it had defaulted on earlier in the month.
When employees at a Harmon Face Values store in Wayne locked the door for the last time, many employees lingered, Mr. Ferraioli said. Colleagues were crying and hugging one another.
This was his second time being laid off from Bed Bath & Beyond. In 2020, he was working as a manager at Cost Plus World Market when he received a call while on a beach vacation that he was being let go. In April 2021, Bed Bath & Beyond reached out to bring him on to Harmon.
Mr. Ferraioli, a 58-year-old father of four, is now back out in the job market, but he said this time he'd probably stay away from the retail industry.
"I got a bad taste in my mouth for retail, honestly," said Mr. Ferraioli, who is a retired police officer. "I'm hoping something better comes along that's not retail."

ChatGPT Can Change How We Plan Trips, But Still Has a Ways to Go: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Powerful new artificial-intelligence software is already shaking up the travel industry, but it has a long way to go until it can plan a seamless trip. For now.
One day soon, in the artificial-intelligence-powered future, a vacation might start by telling your smartphone something like this: "I want to take a four-day trip to Los Angeles in June, whenever airfares and hotel rates are best, using loyalty rewards points. I want to hit a history museum and an amusement park -- and then I'd like 7 p.m. dinner reservations near the hotel at a restaurant with vegan options and a great wine list." And your phone spits out the perfect itinerary.
But for now, travelers using ChatGPT -- the powerful new A.I. software that is already offering creative cocktail recipes and writing college papers -- may have to temper their expectations.
Oded Battat, the general manager at Traveland, a travel agency in Bridgeport, Conn., asked ChatGPT for outings he might offer his clients going to Tuscany to see if it could help him with his work. He got a list of 14 activities, including winery tours and museum visits, with a stop for gelato in the town square of the medieval hill town San Gimignano. "I knew of all these things," Mr. Battat said, but, he added, ChatGPT saved him the hassle of collecting all the information and delivered it in a format he was able to email to one of the clients.
ChatGPT, the service Mr. Battat has begun using, burst onto the scene in November, and it has already begun to shake up tech-driven industries, including travel. Unlike the A.I. that's already familiar to most consumers -- think website chatbots -- ChatGPT is "generative," meaning it can analyze or summarize content from a huge set of information, including web pages, books and other writing available on the internet, and use that data to create original new content. Its advanced natural language capabilities also mean it understands and responds in a more conversational way.
Many uses, and limitations
The travel industry may never be the same. Already, travelers can "converse" with the system, sharing information like a destination, time of year and interests, and getting back a personalized itinerary festooned with vivid descriptions.
A reporter's recent request for a two-day itinerary to Whistler, British Columbia, yielded ideas like snowshoeing with a guide who will point out the local flora and fauna, and taking a dog-sled ride "with a team of beautiful huskies" for a winter trip. Given additional parameters, ChatGPT will update its suggestions, so adding a preference for Thai food to the Whistler conversation prompted the system to give new restaurant suggestions.
But ChatGPT does have limitations. First, its information base currently does not go beyond 2021, and it does not have access to important travel-related data that can change from moment to moment, like airline schedules and weather forecasts. New versions are being developed, including a major upgrade released this week, and are expected to keep improving. Also, the software doesn't always know the difference between reliable and unreliable information on the internet, so it can offer answers that are untrue. ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, also warns that the software may occasionally produce "biased content."
Anyone can use the software, which is free and accessible via the OpenAI website. Tourist bureaus can ask ChatGPT to write marketing copy describing must-see sites, and travel advisers can use it to compose emails to their clients and create social media posts. Airline, hotel and rental car companies could use it to help their virtual agents answer a wider variety of questions.
One travel adviser said she used ChatGPT to write a "firm but friendly breakup letter" to a client with whom she no longer wanted to work. The adviser had to rewrite the prompt -- the term for a ChatGPT question or command -- a few times to get what she wanted, but in the end it worked. "My client said she understood and wasn't mad at me," said the adviser, who asked to remain anonymous because she did not want her former client to know that ChatGPT had written the letter.
A 'significant new step'
Some in the industry worry that as systems like ChatGPT improve, they might put travel advisers out of business, said Chad Burt, a co-president of OutsideAgents, a Jacksonville, Fla., company with 8,000 advisers in its network. But, he said, "the imminent demise of travel agents has always been predicted, and each new technology is a tool to be used." He recently gave a tech tips seminar to his advisers and is compiling a list of prompts his advisers can use to make the most of the software.
Mr. Burt, who has been experimenting with ChatGPT, has used it to create more than 100 itineraries. The result is a great starting point and "can save some basic legwork," he said, "but a good agent still needs to fact-check and enhance it." For example, he explained, only a human can tease out what travelers say they want versus what they really want. The software gets "70 or 80 percent -- but we're not aiming for a C grade," he said.
Expedia, one of the world's largest online travel companies, has been using A.I. for years to personalize recommendations and program its online virtual adviser, but ChatGPT is a "significant new step," said Peter Kern, Expedia's chief executive.
His company is looking at the new technology as a possible way to give customers a more conversational way to interact with Expedia, Mr. Kern said, for example, by speaking or typing questions instead of pointing and clicking. Expedia could also work with ChatGPT to personalize recommendations better by combining its data with the two types of data his company tracks: customers' purchase history and the most current pricing and availability of airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars.
Aylin Caliskan, a University of Washington professor of computer science who studies machine learning and how society affects artificial intelligence, predicts that other travel companies will go the same route, adding their own data and programming to generative A.I. systems like those being created by Google, Amazon and OpenAI, to accomplish specific tasks.
The systems take an enormous amount of investment, data and human work to create, she said, so it will be more efficient to build on top of them. A travel insurance company, for example, could build a system using the natural-language capabilities of software like ChatGPT that would help travelers choose the most appropriate policies or guide them through the process of submitting claims.
Generative A.I. could also improve foreign-language translation, potentially helping travelers conduct conversations with local people, Dr. Caliskan said. And combined with virtual reality technology, it could also allow travel companies to give customers a preview "visit" of a destination using a virtual reality headset, without leaving home.
Fearing an 'A.I. junk land'
Jeff Low, the chief executive of Stash Hotels Rewards, a company that awards loyalty points for staying at a set of independent hotels, worries about the effect new A.I. like ChatGPT may have on the lodging industry. If one promise of artificial intelligence is automating routine tasks so that workers can personally connect with guests, "the reality is different," Mr. Low said. Hotels have already been more likely to cut jobs when A.I. was introduced, he said, for example, reducing front desk staff when automated check-in became popular. "Interacting with people is an important part of travel," he said. "And hotels can differentiate themselves through those connections."
Mr. Low also worries that unethical companies could use software like ChatGPT to undermine the value of guest reviews on travel sites, information many rely on to make hotel choices. This kind of software could make it easier for so-called review farms -- which create fake positive or negative postings -- to become more sophisticated, perhaps even creating traveler profiles that will pump out seemingly legitimate reviews over months and years, he said. Travel companies have systems to weed out fake reviews, he said, "but if a college professor can't tell if a bot wrote a student's paper, how will Tripadvisor know if a review is legitimate?"
There are other potential downsides as the capabilities of generative A.I. are used by more travel providers. A natural-language answer sounds very authoritative, "so people will believe it more than they should," Mr. Burt said. And because Google loves fresh content when it comes to ranking search results, companies that want to raise their internet profiles may start using ChatGPT-like software to write an ever-larger raft of blog and social media posts. The internet "might become an A.I. junk land," Mr. Burt said.
But for all the potential problems, an A.I.-powered future could still be a boon to travelers: If ChatGPT or other generative systems gain access to up-to-the-minute information, a sudden change in one plan could automatically ripple through the rest, said Chekitan Dev, a professor at the Nolan School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. If your flight is delayed, for example, the system could postpone your car rental and send the restaurant where you plan to dine that evening a message to rebook your reservation for a later time.
So will the future bring an autonomous vehicle that "knows" to pick you up at the airport when your delayed plane arrives, then takes you sightseeing and ends up at a place with the best pad Thai in town? Or maybe A.I. and virtual reality engineers will someday team up to bring us a "Star Trek" Holodeck-like experience that feels almost as real as a vacation, and we'll never leave home. "This is uncharted waters for all of us," Dr. Dev said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A struggling N.F.L. franchise is for sale. So is a Premier League club that is a storied name in a global sport. The markets for the two teams say a lot about sports economics.
Washington's football team hasn't won a championship in three decades, struggles to sell out its stadium and was recently ranked the least desirable team in the league by players. Manchester United is a perennial contender in the Premier League and is one of the most sought-after sports brands with about a billion fans around the globe.
The owners of both teams are exploring selling their clubs. The Washington Commanders are considering bids likely to exceed $ 6 billion, while Manchester United appears so far to have failed to secure bids for a similar amount.
On the surface, it defies logic that the Commanders are worth anything close to what Manchester United is. They have languished in a sport that is barely played outside North America, while Manchester United is one of the top teams in soccer, a global game with considerable potential for growth.
But the potential sale price of the two teams speaks volumes about the economics and the financial fortunes of the N.F.L., by far America's most dominant league, and the Premier League, the world's top-grossing domestic soccer competition.
Here is a primer on the disparity between the values of the clubs:
What are some of the differences in the economics of the two leagues?
"It's simple, the economic structure of the N.F.L. is far superior to the economic structure of the E.P.L.," said Sal Galatioto, a longtime sports banker who teaches the business of sports at Columbia University. "If you lose every game in the N.F.L., you still make money."
The reason: The N.F.L. evenly divides all of its national revenue -- from broadcast contracts, merchandise sales, sponsorships and so on -- among its 32 teams, regardless of their performance. That money makes up about 75 percent of each team's revenue, creating financial parity. (The rest comes from local revenue like ticket sales, parking and stadium naming rights.)
In the Premier League, some media revenue is distributed based on merit, so better teams earn more. And, each year, the three worst-performing teams are relegated to the Championship, where the media money is less lucrative.
What are the media deals worth?
In 2021, the N.F.L. renewed most of its broadcast contracts. They are worth more than $ 110 billion, nearly double the last deal. N.F.L. players receive a maximum of 48.8 percent of those media contracts, as well as merchandise sales, sponsorships and other national sources. The owners get the rest.
Critically, those broadcast contracts run into the next decade. That means even the Commanders, who have not won a playoff game since the second Bush administration, received roughly $ 350 million in national revenue, according to financials published by the Green Bay Packers, the only publicly owned team.
The Premier League media deals are typically smaller and shorter, though clubs that qualify for other tournaments like the Champions League can earn additional revenue. (Increased competition has made it harder than ever to finish in the top four and qualify for the Champions League.) The last time the Premier League's television rights were renewed in England, they grew only slightly, though international rights deals continue to rise in value. The league will earn a little less than $ 5 billion in media rights fees this year in total, less than half of what the N.F.L. will earn.
How do labor costs factor in?
N.F.L. players belong to the N.F.L. Players Association, which negotiated a new, 10-year collective bargaining agreement in 2020. The N.F.L. also has a salary cap -- $ 208 million last year, rising to $ 225 million this year. That means every club's biggest expense -- player payroll -- is fixed.
This stability is lacking in the Premier League, which has fewer limits on payroll, which can lead to expensive and even crippling bidding wars for players. Failing to qualify for tournaments can prevent teams from keeping pace financially with their biggest rivals.
"Their player wages are so high that when they don't make the Champions League, it can be punitive," said Rob Tilliss, the founder of Inner Circle Sports, which has brokered team purchases in numerous sports.
What about supply and demand?
There are only 32 N.F.L. teams, with little chance of expansion -- and that lack of supply keeps prices high. Teams also change hands infrequently, and when they do, their sale prices grow, which in turn enhances the value of the other 31 teams. The Buffalo Bills were sold for $ 1.4 billion in 2014. Four years later, the Carolina Panthers were purchased for $ 2.2 billion. Last year, the Denver Broncos were bought for $ 4.65 billion.
And if a potential Premier League franchise owner finds the price of a team too high, they can buy a team in a lower division, or hop across the English Channel to buy a team in France, Spain or elsewhere.
What prompted these owners to consider selling?
The Glazer family hired bankers to explore a potential sale of Manchester United in November, six months after Chelsea F.C., another top Premier League team, was sold for $ 3.1 billion, far more than expected for a club that was under extreme duress because of government sanctions related to its Russian owner.
For all of its tradition and success, Manchester United -- which has won the Premier League 13 times since its formation in 1992 -- lost more than $ 100 million in each of the last two years, and has more than $ 600 million in debt, according to its most recent financial statement. The amount it spends on player wages skyrocketed in the last decade and the team lost out on revenue by often failing to qualify for the Champions League.
Before reports of a possible sale in November, Manchester United's stock price was below $ 14, where it traded when it was first listed in 2012. Fans have frequently demonstrated against the Glazers, viewing them as absentee owners interested in money, not sport.
The Commanders have plenty of problems, too. They were 30th in the league in attendance last season, despite playing in the sixth-largest market in the country. Their stadium is unappealing and difficult to reach, and their owner, Dan Snyder, has been unable to secure public money to help build a new one.
Snyder was also in a bitter fight with three of his former limited partners, and he and some of his top executives have been accused of sexual harassment and creating a toxic workplace, which prompted a congressional committee to hold hearings last year. The attorneys general in the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland are looking into various allegations against the team, including a possible ticket-skimming scheme.
Who are the potential buyers for these teams?
There have been at least two bids for Manchester United. Jim Ratcliffe, a British billionaire who made his fortune from the chemical company Ineos, and Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, the son of a former prime minister of Qatar, announced that they had submitted bids.
The value of their bids are not known, but they do not seem to have lived up to the Glazer family's hopes. English news media outlets have reported that the Glazers are asking for revised bids, and have pushed back their targeted sale deadline to the summer from this spring. The Glazers may not sell the team at all: They have said they are exploring new investments or "other transactions" in addition to a possible sale.
While a sale price of $ 6 billion or more might seem excessive for the Commanders, groups led by Josh Harris, a founder of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management who also owns the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils, and Tilman Fertitta, a casino and restaurant magnate who owns the Houston Rockets, are considering serious bids for the club. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the third-wealthiest person in the world, has also hired bankers to explore a potential bid.

A Bank Fails, and the Clock Is Ticking for a Start-Up: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank set major financial disruptions in motion. It also made one founder's week a scramble.
Sara Mauskopf's day-to-day concerns -- her customers, her employees, her own three children -- don't typically involve the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. She is the chief executive of Winnie, a start-up that helps families find child care and helps child care providers find customers, serving over 250,000 day cares and millions of families. Ms. Mauskopf, 38, has raised over $ 15 million for Winnie since its founding in 2016 and employs 29 people. All of her company's money was in Silicon Valley Bank.
So when the bank collapsed last Friday, it suddenly became very important to Ms. Mauskopf what the F.D.I.C. did. Her company joined nearly half the venture capital-backed technology and science start-ups in the United States, which banked with SVB, worrying over whether they would have access to their money and be able to pay their employees. In the days since, Ms. Mauskopf has been cautiously watching how the bank's failure might affect the economy -- and rethinking where her company will keep its money going forward.
To explain what it felt like in real time to be a customer of the second biggest now-failed bank in U.S. history, Ms. Mauskopf gave The New York Times a rundown of the hour-to-hour changes, and her scramble to try to raise $ 200,000 for payroll in two days. It is stressful to keep a business running while your own bank's failure is upending the tech industry. Her account has been edited and condensed for space and clarity.
6:30 a.m.
I woke up at my usual time and started my day with no knowledge that anything was going on with SVB whatsoever. I don't pay attention to bank C.E.O.s' statements. I had no idea that there was anything to even pay attention to. I had a meeting and had to drive 40 minutes to San Francisco, so I was getting in the car to go to that when I saw an email from one of our investors saying, there's going to be a run on SVB and people are getting their money out.
I wanted to assess: Is this an emergency, like, drop everything? Or is this like, "I can wait and continue about my day?" That's when I contacted other founders through groups I'm in on Slack and WhatsApp. I emailed back the investor who had told me about this. The consensus was that since our money in SVB is in what's called a cash sweep account -- basically, an account where cash is swept into a fund with more interest but low risk -- it was safe.
If anything were to happen to our deposits, it was insured. I checked with our lawyers, who told me we could not pull money out of SVB without violating the terms of our venture debt agreement (a loan for early-stage, high-growth companies). I didn't want to void that agreement because you lose the venture debt line.
11:10 a.m.
A number of people in founder group chats said they were leaving their money in SVB, and a number of people said they had wired theirs out. That's when I decided to wire some funds to a different account.
I emailed my personal bankers when I was driving in the car. I pulled over and I wrote to them: "Hi folks, hoping one of you might be able to point me in the right direction. I'm hoping to move a portion of Winnie's corporate banking."
I knew the fastest way to get a corporate account would be with a bank who already had me as a personal account. I knew a lot of other founders had wired money into their personal accounts, which is something I didn't feel comfortable doing. I wanted to have a corporate account set up before I wired money out. But by the time I got it set up, I was told the wire wouldn't be transferred until first thing Friday morning.
8:45 a.m.
I didn't sleep all Thursday night. I started texting with investors and they were telling me that people had actually gone to SVB branches to get cashier's checks. I was like, "Wow, everyone got out except for me because I was doing my due diligence." I am usually the fastest mover in a situation, but one of my resolutions has been to take more time to digest things before I react. I took all of two hours to digest, and it was too late. I missed the bank run.
I woke up on Friday, threw on clothes and got to the SVB branch in Palo Alto at 8:45. It was supposed to open at 9 a.m. or 9:30. I drove to the branch where I knew another founder had gotten a cashier's check. There were already Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation notices posted to the bank door saying it was closed.
There were a few other people there super early, and it was raining, and we were all walking back to our cars looking sad. The other people there were also super nerdy looking and I was like, "Yup, those are founders." The four of us who were there didn't talk because I was not in conversation mode.
9:30 a.m.
I looked at payroll. The transfer from the SVB account to the payroll provider, around $ 200,000, was supposed to happen Monday. I called Gusto, our payroll provider, and I asked: "Is this transfer going to work on Monday?" They were like, "Yeah, it'll work, I don't know what you're talking about!"
Later on Friday, they sent a notice along the lines of: "Actually it won't work, if your account was connected to SVB you better wire us the money you need for payroll." That was really when I started realizing I needed to come up with this money.
I scheduled a call with our employment attorney for Saturday because I wanted to understand -- could we miss payroll? I knew it would hurt my employees, but what do you actually do if you miss payroll? It turns out you can't miss payroll, especially not in the state of California.
10:30 a.m.
I got on a Zoom call with my co-founder and our operations lead to discuss the full situation and all the things going wrong. Our credit card was with SVB and I knew those charges were going to start failing. I was like, "We're going to have to move credit cards for all of these services." I took a quick average -- Amazon Web Services, software like Slack and Notion, Google -- and I realized it was probably not going to be more than $ 10,000 on a given day for charges that come in.
It was not until Friday night or Saturday morning that stuff started failing on the credit card. We moved the charges to Brex. Then they got blocked on Brex. That's when I started moving them to my personal cards. My husband is also an employee of Winnie. I said: "Hey, Eric, I'm going to be putting all these charges on our credit card. Don't charge anything else. And by the way how much money is in our checking account? Because I might need to withdraw all of that to put toward our payroll."
11:52 a.m.
I got on Slack to update my team: "We don't have access to any of our funds at the moment. While our money is 'safe' it is not accessible to withdraw. We expect to get access to some funds on Monday, which is important because that's when payroll tries to withdraw money from our account to pay y'all. We hope to not experience any delays and will keep everyone posted!"
6 a.m.
My co-founder was on Slack with me the whole weekend. I kind of felt like I was running mission control and I had to communicate with a bunch of different parties. It was sometimes hard to triage. Who did I have to communicate with and who was just trying to be helpful?
I had to keep telling myself: "I cannot access my bank account. I need to do what I have to do to secure funds for Monday." It was almost as if I was raising venture capital. A fund-raise process, when you're raising venture capital, can take six to nine months. I was looking to get money in 24 hours. It was intense.
7:41 a.m.
I sent an email to all my investors with the subject line "Winnie urgent cash needs due to SVB." The email opened: "Hi investors! Thank you for all the advice from our board and others. As I'm sure you are well aware, the F.D.I.C. closed SVB on Friday. We were not prepared for this to happen. I wanted to provide an update on how Winnie is doing right now."
I told them the situation and I told them how much money we were looking for by Monday. It was under $ 200,000 to make payroll, but two weeks later we had another payroll looming. That produced a lot of leads. Some people tried to help directly. Other people pointed me to funders and loan options.
I started a spreadsheet and wrote every name down. There was everything out there -- people who were going to put money on a convertible note with no prepayment penalties, people looking to charge high interest rates, people who were looking to basically sell your deposits at SVB for a discount. It was kind of hard to know, is this predatory? I was trying to stack rank everything. My investors were my first choice. Then there were my friends who were saying, "Yeah I'll loan you money on an I.O.U., but I don't have that much money." I was cataloging those options.
At one point my husband brought me the leftover cheese quesadillas that my kids hadn't eaten, which were cold and probably disgusting with their germs and snot, and I scarfed them down like they were the best thing I'd ever tasted. I got notifications from my watch that I wasn't standing. I was like, "Yeah I'm definitely not standing."
7:30 p.m.
It was the big annual gala for my kids' preschool. My husband had been working all school year to plan it. It's the one event we go to. My mother-in-law came in, she came to say hi to me and I was like, "can't talk." I showed up at the gala for an hour. I got there and my investor was calling me, and I was thinking, "This is silly, I can't even function here." I was wondering, "Should I have a drink?" I had a sip and thought: "This is a really bad idea."
8:30 p.m.
I had some food and went home. I was in the process of opening another bank account. The banker who was setting me up with an online portal had to call me. There were also rumors saying that I would have to file an F.D.I.C. claim; investors at that point were sending updates to their portfolio companies on actions you should be taking.
You had to create a login on this government website. They had this whole process to verify your identity where you had to hold up your driver's license in this very certain way. That took a long time. Then you got into the actual claim filing and all you had to do was write your name and the name of the account. I thought: "This will never work. What is this thing I just filed?"
There were all these rumors in the back channels that you should upload bank statements, but we didn't have access to our bank statements because they were in the SVB portal that was down. I went to bed late and woke up panicked multiple times throughout the night.
10:08 a.m.
I told employees, on Slack, that we were doing everything in our power to make payroll, but there was a chance it might be late. I told them to come to me if that was going to be a real hardship. My employees were so understanding. Some of them came to me proactively and said: "Skip my payroll so you can pay other people."
11:38 a.m.
We were getting closer to identifying our first and second choice loan options. The people that were loaning us money had to work out what vehicle they were going to do the loans on. We had documents going back and forth with our lawyers. I'm sure I racked up a ton of legal bills.
We reviewed different loan documents and we were finalizing the new bank account setup. I had to update everything that links to our bank account, including platforms like Stripe, which is where our revenue comes into (from child care providers), and I wanted to make sure that wasn't going to the SVB account.
3:20 p.m.
I was working through a loan document when the news came in that everyone was going to have access to their SVB accounts and be able to withdraw all their money. There was an F.D.I.C. joint statement that everyone started sharing immediately on Twitter: "Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13."
That was the first breather I had. I did go see my kids and get something to eat. Then I realized I needed to thank people for all their help, including investors and everyone who sent me advice along the way.
9 p.m.
I knew I would have to wake up really early on Monday to try and initiate the wire transfer out of SVB. I was trying to figure out how early. Did Monday morning mean midnight? That would be 9 p.m. Pacific on Sunday. I quickly figured out it wasn't 9 p.m. We also got a new credit card from this company called Ramp, and I was able to move charges to the Ramp card.
4 a.m.
I set so many alarms, the first being at 4 a.m. Pacific, which was 7 a.m. Eastern, because I didn't want to be the last one out of SVB. I was able to log in at 6:30 a.m. Pacific. There were 10 different authentication steps to submit a wire transfer where it keeps asking for an additional security question or text message. At each of those steps there was a 90 percent chance of getting logged out because of traffic.
I submitted a wire transfer (for all the money in the account) at 8:30. Then I spent hours just refreshing the new bank's online portal to see if the money was appearing. Wire transfers are the scariest thing to me. They disappear from one account before you see them in another account. I had never done a wire transfer this big. Normally I would have done a test transfer but I wanted to get it out.
5 p.m.
We had to wait until the money was in our account to initiate the wire transfer to the payroll provider. Then I picked my daughter up from school because I felt like I needed to give my husband a little break. I told my daughter, who is 7½, that all the money was in a new bank account. She did the umpire "safe!" motion. I thought that was really cute. It's amazing what kids understand.
6 a.m.
There were tons of loose ends we had to plug up. We have a couple customers that pay us outside normal systems, through A.C.H. transfers, so we had to update all of our banking information with them.
My other daughter, who is 4, did show and tell at school on Tuesday morning and for her item she picked a piggy bank. She absorbed a lot of this drama, clearly.
8:53 a.m.
There was a bad storm on Tuesday so I lost all power and internet. I took a really cold shower. Then I got in my car and headed to a co-working space. I had to get internet access. I had been ignoring my team. I needed to pay some attention to them and get back to work. There was also a lot to clean up for our new accounts. I needed to figure out the right allocation of funds in all the banking accounts I've set up.
There's some talk of people keeping money with SVB. I received an email from them saying SVB is the safest bank, we will honor your venture debt if you come back. I have to digest that. I don't ever want to hold all my money in one institution ever again.
6:45 a.m.
The power came back after the storm. I cleaned out my refrigerator and took a hot shower. We also have a big product launch coming up next week for summer camps. Now is the time when parents search for summer child care, and we'd hoped to launch the product this week but pushed it to next because of everything going on in the world. Certainly there was some context switching between, "I have no access to my bank," "I have no access to power" and "OK, we're back to business."

Open a Retirement Plan, but Don't Leave It in Limbo: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Millions of workers open retirement accounts, then ignore or forget about them, leaving thousands of dollars unattended. Are you one of them?
Raquel Charles was in her mid-20s when she signed up -- begrudgingly -- for her first retirement account. Wading through paperwork to start her job at the Administration for Children's Services in New York City, she would have skipped over the retirement option if not for an older colleague's intervention.
"She saw that I was young and didn't know what I was doing," Ms. Charles recalled. "She told me, 'Just put away something, even if it's the bare minimum."' Ms. Charles decided to contribute 1 percent of her salary.
For the next decade, retirement was the last thing on Ms. Charles's mind as she focused on her career and family. "I saw a few dollars coming out of my paychecks, but I never thought about it," she said. It finally dawned on her to check the account when her mother retired last year. "I had to set a new password, because I don't think I ever created one in the first place," she said. "When I finally opened it, I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm in trouble. I have barely any money in here."'
Now 37, Ms. Charles has increased her retirement contributions and joined a women's personal finance group on Facebook to learn more about financial planning. "I'm annoyed that I wasted 10 years when I could have saved a lot more," she said. "When I was younger, I had fewer financial responsibilities and more flexibility. Now, I have two children and a mortgage."
Despite her frustration, Ms. Charles is faring much better than the millions of Americans who neglect their retirement accounts for much longer -- or, in many cases, permanently.
The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that about 21 million vested retirement accounts in the United States are inactive, meaning that they are eligible to be tapped but sit dormant instead. The same researchers calculated in 2018 that the average value of assets in these inactive accounts was about $ 60,000, with a median amount of about $ 15,000, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Labor. That's an amount of money most people can't afford to lose.
"The numbers cannot show if these accounts are truly forgotten, or if people do plan to access the money someday," said Laura Quinby, a senior research economist with the Center for Retirement Research. "What we do know, though, is that a lot of people lose track of their retirement savings when they switch jobs, so they might not remember that it's there."
If you've ever tried to roll over a retirement account, you can probably relate. I had several different jobs at the beginning of my career, all of which offered 401(k) benefits. By the time I reached my 30s, I was dimly aware that I had three separate retirement accounts (all containing paltry amounts) floating around with former employers. Figuring out how to retrieve and consolidate them took days of phone calls, paperwork and coordination with different financial firms.
Understandably, many people never get that far. "People have busy lives and other interests. They don't have the degree of financial literacy that would make them comfortable engaging with their retirement accounts," said Steven Holman, who helps oversee record-keeping and asset management at Vanguard, a company that provides investment management and retirement account services for more than 30 million clients. "There's a lot of fear and hassle involved, so it's easier to avoid it." The recent market volatility stemming from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank doesn't exactly stoke enthusiasm for financial planning, either.
Stranded retirement accounts are even more prevalent among workers with lower incomes and savings rates (ironically, those who need their savings the most). A report from Vanguard found that those with smaller retirement account balances -- usually less than $ 5,000 -- were more likely to leave them behind. "Unfortunately, that can have very real financial implications," Mr. Holman said. For instance, when a worker leaves a job with less than $ 5,000 in their 401(k), their former employer is allowed to move that account into a Safe Harbor individual retirement account, which is overseen by a different provider that may impose higher management fees. (Employers are motivated to do this because holding onto a lot of small, inactive accounts can be a costly administrative headache.)
Another problem with ignoring your retirement accounts is, of course, that it's harder to plan for your future. Most experts recommend checking on your long-term savings around once a year, to make sure it's invested in accordance with your retirement timeline. But Lara Starr, 54, hadn't looked at her savings for decades when her husband died unexpectedly a few years ago. "Even though I was the primary breadwinner in my family, my husband managed our money," she said. "I always found it too stressful."
After Ms. Starr's husband died, she realized she had to face her accounts alone. "Opening the binder full of statements that I'd never looked at was one of the hardest things I've ever done," she said. Although she'd put money in a 401(k) throughout her marketing career in Marin County, Calif., she wasn't thrilled with what she found. "I made a spreadsheet with the numbers, and realized it wasn't enough," she said. "So then I had to ask myself, 'What does that mean?"'
These days, Ms. Starr uses a budgeting app and tracks her cash flow and savings meticulously. "Now, I know what I contribute to my 401(k). I know what it's building towards. I even did some projections to see what the money might look like in 20 years when I do need to retire," she said.
Still, Ms. Starr wishes she hadn't buried her head in the sand for so long. "Saving for retirement feels like standing at the edge of a pool with an eyedropper," she said. "If I had been more hands-on when my husband was still alive, I'd like to think it would have kicked me into planning and budgeting earlier." Then again, it's hard to say. "The reality is, it could have just made me even more anxious about money."
For others, stumbling upon a long-lost retirement account is a boon. "For most of my adult life, I was so overwhelmed by my student loans that I never really had a financial plan for my future," said Kathryn Lonczewski, 37. "I couldn't even think about having assets when it seemed like I had so much debt."
Then, in 2020, Ms. Lonczewski started a new job at Amazon and was awarded a signing bonus. "I'd never received a chunk of cash like that, so that's when I started asking questions about my finances.
"Should I pay down debt? Do I invest it? I'd never had choices like that because I'd been living so hand-to-mouth for years," she said. That's when she remembered she had a retirement account from a previous job. "I honestly had no idea what I'd find in there," she said. "It wound up being about $ 60,000 -- much better than nothing. I was pretty happy about it."
Now a project manager at Yale University in New Haven, Conn., Ms. Lonczewski checks her 401(k) balance each month. "I feel like I have some catching up to do, but it's also motivating," she said. Last year, she started hosting a book club where she and other members of her community meet and talk about their financial goals.
Finding your money
For those who aren't sure how to retrieve their lost accounts (or whether any exist), there are a number of ways to find out. One is the National Registry of Unclaimed Retirement Benefits, a database that allows you to hunt down old plans using your Social Security number. The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators also runs a searchable website, and the Department of Labor has a special database for abandoned plans.
In this era of digital records, it's hard to believe that technology hasn't solved this problem. But it's starting to, Mr. Holman said. He oversees Vanguard's efforts to automatically integrate its clients' old or abandoned retirement plans into their existing, active ones, a process known as auto-portability. "A participant doesn't even have to do anything," he said. "You go to a new job, open a new plan, and the Portability Services Network will automatically find your old account and transition those assets in short order." This cuts out the time-consuming paperwork involved in the traditional rollover process.
Auto-portability only applies to accounts containing less than $ 5,000, so people with higher balances still need to take a more active role in tracking down their lost savings. But it is helpful for people whose accounts might otherwise be exiled to a Safe Harbor I.R.A. And auto-portability technology is expanding, Mr. Holman added. "We're fairly confident that over time, we'll have broad adoption across the industry," he said. "You'll just get a letter that says, 'You had $ 3,000 in a retirement account with your old employer. Congratulations, it's in your new plan.' And it'll be a great surprise."

48 Hours Till Payroll, $200,000 to Go: Diary of a Bank Failure

Sara Mauskopf’s day-to-day concerns — her customers, her employees, her own three children — don’t typically involve the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. She is CEO of Winnie, a startup that helps families find child care and helps child care providers find customers, serving more than 250,000 day care centers and millions of families. Mauskopf, 38, has raised more than $15 million for Winnie since its founding in 2016 and employs 29 people. All of her company’s money was in Silicon Valley Bank.
So when the bank collapsed March 10, it suddenly became very important to Mauskopf what the FDIC did. Her company joined nearly half the venture-capital-backed technology and science startups in the United States, which banked with Silicon Valley Bank, worrying over whether they would have access to their money and be able to pay their employees. Since then, Mauskopf has been cautiously watching how the bank’s failure might affect the economy — and rethinking where her company will keep its money going forward.
To explain what it felt like in real time to be a customer of the second-biggest now-failed bank in U.S. history, Mauskopf gave The New York Times a rundown of the hour-to-hour changes, and her scramble to raise $200,000 for payroll in two days. It is stressful to keep a business running while your own bank’s failure is upending the tech industry. Her account has been edited for space and clarity.
THURSDAY, MARCH 9
6:30 a.m.
I woke up at my usual time and started my day with no knowledge that anything was going on with SVB whatsoever. I don’t pay attention to bank CEOs’ statements. I had no idea that there was anything to even pay attention to. I had a meeting and had to drive 40 minutes to San Francisco, so I was getting in the car to go to that when I saw an email from one of our investors saying there’s going to be a run on SVB and people are getting their money out.
I wanted to assess: Is this an emergency, like, drop everything? Or is this like, “I can wait and continue about my day?” That’s when I contacted other founders through groups I’m in on Slack and WhatsApp. I emailed back the investor who had told me about this. The consensus was that since our money in SVB is in what’s called a cash sweep account — basically, an account where cash is swept into a fund with more interest but low risk — it was safe.
If anything were to happen to our deposits, it was insured. I checked with our lawyers, who told me we could not pull money out of SVB without violating the terms of our venture debt agreement (a loan for early-stage high-growth companies). I didn’t want to void that agreement because you lose the venture debt line.
11:10 a.m.
A number of people in founder group chats said they were leaving their money in SVB, and a number of people said they had wired theirs out. That’s when I decided to wire some funds to a different account.
I emailed my personal bankers when I was driving in the car. I pulled over and I wrote to them: “Hi folks, hoping one of you might be able to point me in the right direction. I’m hoping to move a portion of Winnie’s corporate banking.”
I knew the fastest way to get a corporate account would be with a bank who already had me as a personal account. I knew a lot of other founders had wired money into their personal accounts, which is something I didn’t feel comfortable doing. I wanted to have a corporate account set up before I wired money out. But by the time I got it set up, I was told the wire wouldn’t be transferred until first thing Friday morning.
FRIDAY, MARCH 10
8:45 a.m.
I didn’t sleep all Thursday night. I started texting with investors and they were telling me that people had actually gone to SVB branches to get cashier’s checks. I was like, “Wow, everyone got out except for me because I was doing my due diligence.” I am usually the fastest mover in a situation, but one of my resolutions has been to take more time to digest things before I react. I took all of two hours to digest, and it was too late. I missed the bank run.
I woke up on Friday, threw on clothes and got to the SVB branch in Palo Alto at 8:45. It was supposed to open at 9 a.m. or 9:30. I drove to the branch where I knew another founder had gotten a cashier’s check. There were already Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. notices posted to the bank door saying it was closed.
There were a few other people there super early, and it was raining, and we were all walking back to our cars looking sad. The other people there were also super nerdy looking and I was like, “Yup, those are founders.” The four of us who were there didn’t talk because I was not in conversation mode.
9:30 a.m.
I looked at payroll. The transfer from the SVB account to the payroll provider, around $200,000, was supposed to happen Monday. I called Gusto, our payroll provider, and I asked: “Is this transfer going to work on Monday?” They were like, “Yeah, it’ll work, I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
Later Friday, they sent a notice along the lines of: “Actually it won’t work, if your account was connected to SVB, you better wire us the money you need for payroll.” That was really when I started realizing I needed to come up with this money.
I scheduled a call with our employment attorney for Saturday because I wanted to understand — could we miss payroll? I knew it would hurt my employees, but what do you actually do if you miss payroll? It turns out you can’t miss payroll, especially not in the state of California.
10:30 a.m.
I got on a Zoom call with my co-founder and our operations lead to discuss the full situation and all the things going wrong. Our credit card was with SVB and I knew those charges were going to start failing. I was like, “We’re going to have to move credit cards for all of these services.” I took a quick average — Amazon Web Services, software like Slack and Notion, Google — and I realized it was probably not going to be more than $10,000 on a given day for charges that come in.
It was not until Friday night or Saturday morning that stuff started failing on the credit card. We moved the charges to Brex. Then they got blocked on Brex. That’s when I started moving them to my personal cards. My husband is also an employee of Winnie. I said: “Hey, Eric, I’m going to be putting all these charges on our credit card. Don’t charge anything else. And by the way, how much money is in our checking account? Because I might need to withdraw all of that to put toward our payroll.”
11:52 a.m.
I got on Slack to update my team: “We don’t have access to any of our funds at the moment. While our money is ‘safe,’ it is not accessible to withdraw. We expect to get access to some funds on Monday, which is important because that’s when payroll tries to withdraw money from our account to pay y’all. We hope to not experience any delays and will keep everyone posted!”
SATURDAY, MARCH 11
6 a.m.
My co-founder was on Slack with me the whole weekend. I kind of felt like I was running mission control and I had to communicate with a bunch of different parties. It was sometimes hard to triage. Who did I have to communicate with and who was just trying to be helpful?
I had to keep telling myself, “I cannot access my bank account. I need to do what I have to do to secure funds for Monday.” It was almost as if I was raising venture capital. A fundraise process, when you’re raising venture capital, can take six to nine months. I was looking to get money in 24 hours. It was intense.
7:41 a.m.
I sent an email to all my investors with the subject line “Winnie urgent cash needs due to SVB.” The email opened: “Hi investors! Thank you for all the advice from our board and others. As I’m sure you are well aware, the FDIC closed SVB on Friday. We were not prepared for this to happen. I wanted to provide an update on how Winnie is doing right now.”
I told them the situation and I told them how much money we were looking for by Monday. It was under $200,000 to make payroll, but two weeks later, we had another payroll looming. That produced a lot of leads. Some people tried to help directly. Other people pointed me to funders and loan options.
I started a spreadsheet and wrote every name down. There was everything out there — people who were going to put money on a convertible note with no prepayment penalties, people looking to charge high interest rates, people who were looking to basically sell your deposits at SVB for a discount. It was kind of hard to know, is this predatory? I was trying to stack rank everything. My investors were my first choice. Then there were my friends who were saying, “Yeah I’ll loan you money on an IOU, but I don’t have that much money.” I was cataloging those options.
At one point, my husband brought me the leftover cheese quesadillas that my kids hadn’t eaten, which were cold and probably disgusting with their germs and snot, and I scarfed them down like they were the best thing I’d ever tasted. I got notifications from my watch that I wasn’t standing. I was like, “Yeah, I’m definitely not standing.”
7:30 p.m.
It was the big annual gala for my kids’ preschool. My husband had been working all school year to plan it. It’s the one event we go to. My mother-in-law came in, she came to say hi to me, and I was like, “Can’t talk.” I showed up at the gala for an hour. I got there and my investor was calling me, and I was thinking, “This is silly, I can’t even function here.” I was wondering, “Should I have a drink?” I had a sip and thought, “This is a really bad idea.”
8:30 p.m.
I had some food and went home. I was in the process of opening another bank account. The banker who was setting me up with an online portal had to call me. There were also rumors saying that I would have to file an FDIC claim; investors at that point were sending updates to their portfolio companies on actions you should be taking.
You had to create a login on this government website. They had this whole process to verify your identity where you had to hold up your driver’s license in this very certain way. That took a long time. Then you got into the actual claim filing and all you had to do was write your name and the name of the account. I thought: “This will never work. What is this thing I just filed?”
There were all these rumors in the back channels that you should upload bank statements, but we didn’t have access to our bank statements because they were in the SVB portal that was down. I went to bed late and woke up panicked multiple times throughout the night.
SUNDAY, MARCH 12
10:08 a.m.
I told employees, on Slack, that we were doing everything in our power to make payroll, but there was a chance it might be late. I told them to come to me if that was going to be a real hardship. My employees were so understanding. Some of them came to me proactively and said, “Skip my payroll so you can pay other people.”
11:38 a.m.
We were getting closer to identifying our first and second choice loan options. The people that were loaning us money had to work out what vehicle they were going to do the loans on. We had documents going back and forth with our lawyers. I’m sure I racked up a ton of legal bills.
We reviewed different loan documents, and we were finalizing the new bank account setup. I had to update everything that links to our bank account, including platforms like Stripe, which is where our revenue comes into (from child care providers), and I wanted to make sure that wasn’t going to the SVB account.
3:20 p.m.
I was working through a loan document when the news came in that everyone was going to have access to their SVB accounts and be able to withdraw all their money. There was an FDIC joint statement that everyone started sharing immediately on Twitter: “Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.”
That was the first breather I had. I did go see my kids and get something to eat. Then I realized I needed to thank people for all their help, including investors and everyone who sent me advice along the way.
9 p.m.
I knew I would have to wake up really early Monday to try and initiate the wire transfer out of SVB. I was trying to figure out how early. Did Monday morning mean midnight? That would be 9 p.m. Pacific on Sunday. I quickly figured out it wasn’t 9 p.m. We also got a new credit card from this company called Ramp, and I was able to move charges to the Ramp card.
MONDAY, MARCH 13
4 a.m.
I set so many alarms, the first being at 4 a.m. Pacific, which was 7 a.m. Eastern, because I didn’t want to be the last one out of SVB. I was able to log in at 6:30 a.m. Pacific. There were 10 different authentication steps to submit a wire transfer where it keeps asking for an additional security question or text message. At each of those steps, there was a 90% chance of getting logged out because of traffic.
I submitted a wire transfer (for all the money in the account) at 8:30 a.m. Then I spent hours just refreshing the new bank’s online portal to see if the money was appearing. Wire transfers are the scariest thing to me. They disappear from one account before you see them in another account. I had never done a wire transfer this big. Normally, I would have done a test transfer, but I wanted to get it out.
5 p.m.
We had to wait until the money was in our account to initiate the wire transfer to the payroll provider. Then I picked my daughter up from school because I felt like I needed to give my husband a little break. I told my daughter, who is 7 1/2, that all the money was in a new bank account. She did the umpire “Safe!” motion. I thought that was really cute. It’s amazing what kids understand.
TUESDAY, MARCH 14
6 a.m.
There were tons of loose ends we had to plug up. We have a couple of customers that pay us outside normal systems, through ACH transfers, so we had to update all of our banking information with them.
My other daughter, who is 4, did show and tell at school Tuesday morning, and for her item, she picked a piggy bank. She absorbed a lot of this drama, clearly.
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15
8:53 a.m.
There was a bad storm Tuesday, so I lost all power and internet. I took a really cold shower. Then I got in my car and headed to a coworking space. I had to get internet access. I had been ignoring my team. I needed to pay some attention to them and get back to work. There was also a lot to clean up for our new accounts. I needed to figure out the right allocation of funds in all the banking accounts I’ve set up.
There’s some talk of people keeping money with SVB. I received an email from them saying SVB is the safest bank, we will honor your venture debt if you come back. I have to digest that. I don’t ever want to hold all my money in one institution ever again.
THURSDAY, MARCH 16
6:45 a.m.
The power came back after the storm. I cleaned out my refrigerator and took a hot shower. We also have a big product launch coming up next week for summer camps. Now is the time when parents search for summer child care, and we’d hoped to launch the product this week but pushed it to next because of (cue gesture) everything going on in the world.
Certainly there was some context switching between “I have no access to my bank,” “I have no access to power” and “OK, we’re back to business.”

Full text: The Biden administration is pushing TikTok's Chinese owners to sell the app or face a possible ban. But there are many complications to finding a suitor.
TikTok has what many Silicon Valley companies lust after: A culture-making machine beloved by 100 million Americans and deep-pocketed advertisers.
That doesn't mean they will line up to buy it.
TikTok said on Wednesday that the Biden administration was pushing the company's Chinese owners to sell the app or face a possible ban. But there are probably few companies, in the tech industry or elsewhere, willing or able to buy it, analysts and experts say.
At a price of $ 50 billion or more -- the value some analysts said TikTok could command -- the social media platform would be too expensive for many companies, including competitors like Snap. The tech giants that could afford it, such as Facebook owner Meta, Google and Microsoft, are likely to shy away for fear of getting caught in years of antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Then there's the headache of owning a social media company, and figuring out how to handle the endless flood of toxic content.
In addition, it remains unclear how TikTok would fully unravel itself from ByteDance, its parent company in China, or whether any deal would be approved by the Chinese government.
TikTok "has a lot of baggage, and that baggage means that it's hard to make this a reality," said Brian Wieser, an independent consultant who focuses on the media and advertising industries.
There may be other options, such as a private equity company swooping in with an offer with a partner, or ByteDance spinning off TikTok into a stand-alone public company. But if there are a limited number of potential suitors it may complicate the White House's efforts, and continue to drag out what has already been a yearslong battle between Washington and the company.
TikTok has been in the cross hairs of both the Trump and Biden administrations, both of which have said that the app poses a national security threat. Lawmakers have been increasingly concerned that TikTok could put sensitive user data, like location information, into the hands of the Chinese government. They have pointed to laws that allow Beijing to secretly demand data from Chinese companies and citizens for intelligence-gathering operations.
More than two dozen states have issued bans of the app on state-owned devices, and several pieces of federal legislation are also aimed at banning TikTok.
John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, declined to comment on Thursday about whether the administration was pushing ByteDance to sell TikTok. But he said that "we have legitimate national security concerns here, and outside of all that, we continue to support bipartisan legislation that's designed to address those security concerns posed by certain foreign-owned consumer apps."
TikTok said this week that it was weighing its options and that a security proposal it offered the government in August offered the best protection for American users. Under the proposal, the company would spend more than $ 1.5 billion to cordon off access to sensitive U.S. user data and offer oversight and transparency around its content recommendations.
The company's chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, who is Singaporean, is scheduled to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee next Thursday. Lawmakers are expected to question him about the app's ties to China and the content it delivers to young people.
Maureen Shanahan, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said in a statement: "If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: A change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access."
A host of technology companies declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday about their interest in buying TikTok, including Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Twitter.
The Biden administration's push for a sale mirrors the effort by the Trump administration three years ago. At that time, Mr. Trump threatened to ban TikTok from Apple and Google's app stores unless the app was sold to an American company. A group of federal agencies that review national security concerns related to foreign companies, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, had recommended such a move.
Possible buyers for the app included Microsoft and the cloud computing company Oracle. But the Chinese government issued export restrictions in August 2020 that potentially allowed Beijing to block a sale. While Oracle and Walmart ultimately seemed to reach an agreement to buy stakes in the app, resolving Mr. Trump's concerns, the deal never closed.
Multiple federal courts later ruled that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to ban the app, limiting the government's leverage in the case. (Oracle has since been working with TikTok to help it store U.S. user data in domestic servers and has been a key partner in its plan to assuage national security concerns.)
When President Biden took office, the administration initially focused on negotiating a deal through CFIUS with TikTok that would settle the concerns without a forced sale. The company assumed its talks would resolve soon after it submitted a 90-page proposal to the administration in August, but its efforts have been stymied by several revelations around how ByteDance and TikTok have mishandled U.S. user data.
And now, any potential sale looks even more complicated than before.
"It's much more fraught on all levels on the economics of it," said Glenn S. Gerstell, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic & International Studies and the former general counsel of the National Security Agency. "TikTok now has two years of user growth, it's far more entrenched in terms of its position in American social media, and clearly the tensions with China have greatly increased."
Antitrust officials at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are increasingly concerned about attempts by tech giants to buy other companies. The F.T.C. unsuccessfully challenged Meta's acquisition of a small virtual reality start-up and is trying to block Microsoft from buying the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard.
"I think the whole concern with tech platform dominance would be a factor in what buyer or buyers would be acceptable," said William J. Baer, a former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "A tech platform would legitimately have to think about the antitrust risk of buying something that, while not directly a competitor, would be seen as expanding the dominance of that platform in the tech space."
The uncertainty around TikTok's future has been felt by its U.S. employees, who are spread among locations including Los Angeles, the Bay Area, New York and Washington. Morale at the company has waned as state bans and legislation targeting TikTok have gained traction, according to three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
TikTok leaders briefly addressed a potential divestment during a companywide livestream on Tuesday, where executives told employees that a divestment would not address the U.S. government's concerns, according to two of the employees.
In an internal note sent after news broke about the Biden administration's push, Michael Beckerman, TikTok's head of public policy for the Americas, called the Biden administration's push a "developing situation" and said that "divestment doesn't solve anything" if protecting national security is the objective. He added that the company's strategy to build systems to store U.S. user data on U.S.-based servers monitored by a third party "remains the same."
"We feel strongly that this conversation should include the industry at large and not be based on where a company was founded," Mr. Beckerman wrote.

Can ChatGPT Plan Your Vacation? Here’s What to Know About AI and Travel.

One day soon, in the artificial-intelligence-powered future, a vacation might start by telling your smartphone something like this: “I want to take a four-day trip to Los Angeles in June, whenever airfares and hotel rates are best, using loyalty rewards points. I want to hit a history museum and an amusement park, and then I’d like a 7 p.m. dinner reservation near the hotel at a restaurant with vegan options and a great wine list.” And your phone spits out the perfect itinerary.
But for now, travelers using ChatGPT — the powerful new AI software that is already offering creative cocktail recipes and writing college papers — may have to temper their expectations.
Oded Battat, general manager at Traveland, a travel agency in Bridgeport, Connecticut, asked ChatGPT for outings he might offer his clients going to Tuscany, Italy, to see if it could help him with his work. He got a list of 14 activities, including winery tours and museum visits, with a stop for gelato in the town square of the medieval hill town San Gimignano.
“I knew of all these things,” Battat said, but he added that ChatGPT saved him the hassle of collecting all the information and delivered it in a format he was able to email to one of the clients.
ChatGPT, the service Battat has begun using, burst onto the scene in November, and it has already begun to shake up tech-driven industries, including travel. Unlike the AI that’s already familiar to most consumers — think website chatbots — ChatGPT is “generative,” meaning it can analyze or summarize content from a huge set of information, including webpages, books and other writing available on the internet, and use that data to create original new content. Its advanced natural language capabilities also mean it understands and responds in a more conversational way.
Many Uses, and Limitations
The travel industry may never be the same. Already, travelers can “converse” with the system, sharing information like a destination, time of year and interests, and getting back a personalized itinerary festooned with vivid descriptions.
A reporter’s recent request for a two-day itinerary to Whistler, British Columbia, yielded ideas like snowshoeing with a guide who will point out the local flora and fauna, and taking a dog-sled ride “with a team of beautiful huskies” for a winter trip. Given additional parameters, ChatGPT will update its suggestions, so adding a preference for Thai food to the Whistler conversation prompted the system to give new restaurant suggestions.
But ChatGPT does have limitations. First, its information base currently does not go beyond 2021, and it does not have access to important travel-related data that can change from moment to moment, like airline schedules and weather forecasts.
New versions are being developed, including a major upgrade released this week, and are expected to keep improving. Also, the software doesn’t always know the difference between reliable and unreliable information on the internet, so it can offer answers that are untrue. ChatGPT’s maker, OpenAI, also warns that the software may occasionally produce “biased content.”
Anyone can use the software, which is free and accessible via the OpenAI website. Tourist bureaus can ask ChatGPT to write marketing copy describing must-see sites, and travel advisers can use it to compose emails to their clients and create social media posts. Airline, hotel and rental car companies could use it to help their virtual agents answer a wider variety of questions.
One travel adviser said she used ChatGPT to write a “firm but friendly breakup letter” to a client with whom she no longer wanted to work. The adviser had to rewrite the prompt — the term for a ChatGPT question or command — a few times to get what she wanted, but in the end it worked.
“My client said she understood and wasn’t mad at me,” said the adviser, who asked to remain anonymous because she did not want her former client to know that ChatGPT had written the letter.
A ‘Significant New Step’
Some in the industry worry that as systems like ChatGPT improve, they might put travel advisers out of business, said Chad Burt, a co-president of OutsideAgents, a Jacksonville, Florida, company with 8,000 advisers in its network. But, he said, “the imminent demise of travel agents has always been predicted, and each new technology is a tool to be used.”
He recently gave a tech tips seminar to his advisers and is compiling a list of prompts his advisers can use to make the most of the software.
Burt, who has been experimenting with ChatGPT, has used it to create more than 100 itineraries. The result is a great starting point and “can save some basic legwork,” he said, “but a good agent still needs to fact-check and enhance it.” For example, he explained, only a human can tease out what travelers say they want versus what they really want. The software gets “70 or 80% — but we’re not aiming for a C grade,” he said.
Expedia, one of the world’s largest online travel companies, has been using AI for years to personalize recommendations and program its online virtual adviser, but ChatGPT is a “significant new step,” Expedia CEO Peter Kern said.
His company is looking at the new technology as a possible way to give customers a more conversational way to interact with Expedia, Kern said, for example, by speaking or typing questions instead of pointing and clicking. Expedia could also work with ChatGPT to personalize recommendations better by combining its data with the two types of data his company tracks: customers’ purchase history and the most current pricing and availability of airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars.
Aylin Caliskan, a University of Washington professor of computer science who studies machine learning and how society affects artificial intelligence, predicts that other travel companies will go the same route, adding their own data and programming to generative AI systems like those being created by Google, Amazon and OpenAI, to accomplish specific tasks.
The systems take an enormous amount of investment, data and human work to create, she said, so it will be more efficient to build on top of them. A travel insurance company, for example, could build a system using the natural-language capabilities of software like ChatGPT that would help travelers choose the most appropriate policies or guide them through the process of submitting claims.
Generative AI could also improve foreign-language translation, potentially helping travelers conduct conversations with local people, Caliskan said. And combined with virtual reality technology, it could also allow travel companies to give customers a preview “visit” of a destination using a virtual reality headset.
Fearing an ‘AI Junk Land’
Jeff Low, CEO of Stash Hotels Rewards, a company that awards loyalty points for staying at a set of independent hotels, worries about the effect new AI like ChatGPT may have on the lodging industry. If one promise of artificial intelligence is automating routine tasks so that workers can personally connect with guests, “the reality is different,” Low said. Hotels have been more likely to cut jobs when AI was introduced, he said, for example reducing front desk staff when automated check-in became popular.
“Interacting with people is an important part of travel,” he said. “And hotels can differentiate themselves through those connections.”
Low also worries that unethical companies could use software like ChatGPT to undermine the value of guest reviews on travel sites, information many rely on to make hotel choices.
This kind of software could make it easier for so-called review farms — which create fake positive or negative postings — to become more sophisticated, perhaps even creating traveler profiles that will pump out seemingly legitimate reviews over months and years, he said. Travel companies have systems to weed out fake reviews, he said, “but if a college professor can’t tell if a bot wrote a student’s paper, how will Tripadvisor know if a review is legitimate?”
There are other potential downsides as the capabilities of generative AI are used by more travel providers. A natural-language answer sounds authoritative, “so people will believe it more than they should,” Burt said. And because Google loves fresh content when it comes to ranking search results, companies that want to raise their internet profiles may start using ChatGPT-like software to write an ever-larger raft of blog and social media posts.
The internet “might become an AI junk land,” Burt said.
But for all the potential problems, an AI-powered future could still be a boon to travelers: If ChatGPT or other generative systems gain access to up-to-the-minute information, a sudden change in one plan could automatically ripple through the rest, said Chekitan Dev, a professor at the Nolan School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. If your flight is delayed, for example, the system could postpone your car rental and send the restaurant where you plan to dine that evening a message to rebook your reservation for a later time.
So will the future bring an autonomous vehicle that “knows” to pick you up at the airport when your delayed plane arrives, then takes you sightseeing and ends up at a place with the best pad thai in town? Or maybe AI and virtual reality engineers will someday team up to bring us a “Star Trek” holodeck experience that feels almost as real as a vacation, and we’ll never leave home.
“This is uncharted waters for all of us,” Dev said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Golf at 3 p.m. Thursday? Sure, It’s the Afternoon Fun Economy.

At the Chelsea Piers outdoor golf club, on a recent unseasonably warm Monday afternoon, 55 people were playing golf by 3:45, and a handful were sipping beers. At CutLoose hair salon, in Brooklyn, New York, the stylists now watch their clients take Zoom meetings from the salon chairs. And at Skyway Golf Course, in Jersey City, New Jersey, Steve Mills, a general manager, has noticed that weekday afternoons are jammed with a new group of golfers.
“We call them the remote guys,” Mills, 48, said. “These were guys we used to see running to the golf course after work. Now they’re able to come out leisurely and get their golf done, instead of changing in the parking lot.”
The leisure industry is facing a surge in demand for afternoon services, especially in fitness and cosmetics. It’s the rise of the “afternoon fun” economy.
Millions of Americans who started working from home three years ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic are now set in those remote routines because they like the flexibility. At the start of 2023, more than a quarter of paid full-time work days were done from home, according to data from Stanford on U.S. workers. Roughly half of workers who can do their jobs remotely are now in hybrid arrangements. That means people who used to have to use their lunch hour, or wait until after work, to squeeze in a workout or beauty treatments can now extend their leisure time into the afternoon, and tack on extra hours of work after dark.
A new study from Stanford shines a light on the rise of afternoon leisure. Using geolocation data near golf courses in the United States, the study found there was 278% more people playing golf at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in August 2022 than in August 2019. And there were 83% more golf games being played on a weekday in August 2022 than in August 2019, according to the researchers, Nick Bloom and Alex Finan, who studied data, from the company Inrix, at more than 3,400 golf courses.
“We’re turned into a student economy,” Bloom said. “You’re in the library in the evenings, and in the afternoon you’re sleeping off your hangover.”
The rise of afternoon leisure could be playing an under-examined role in driving America’s economic rebound since 2020, Bloom said. Historically, productivity in the manufacturing sector has grown at a faster rate than productivity in the services sector. Service sector productivity tends to grow slowly even as its wages rise quickly to keep pace with other industries. That’s because the amount of time people can devote to services — shopping, entertainment, beauty treatments — has long been constrained by the rigidity of a 9-to-5 grind.
Remote work partly did away with that constraint. More flexible work arrangements mean workers can decide to push back their professional responsibilities into the evening and take care of personal ones during the day — often with the blessing of their bosses.
“This is an amazing potential reversal,” Bloom added. “You can have a huge increase in productivity using leisure resources throughout the week. It’s an odd unexpected boost from post-pandemic working from home.”
The effects of this shift are being felt across the leisure economy. ClassPass, a platform that partners with thousands of fitness and beauty studios, found that the most popular time for people to schedule a salon or spa treatment last year was noon; in 2019, it was 6 p.m. The Chelsea Piers golf club, which had its busiest year ever in 2022, increased the fee for its off-peak membership (for people playing golf at traditionally less popular weekday hours) to $1,825 last year from $1,520 because of rising demand. Bouldering Project, which has 10 rock-climbing gyms in seven U.S. cities, said some of its buildings were full throughout the week with remote workers doing workouts in between their video calls. Y7, a yoga chain, has tracked a surge in sign ups for its 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekday classes.
“We used to get a lot more people leaving early from class in the morning — they wouldn’t stay for Shavasana,” Sarah Larson Levey, chief executive of Y7, said, referring to the final resting portion of a yoga class. “Literally right after the slow burn portion, before any restorative poses, half the room would leave.”
With more people now working remote, that exodus no longer occurs. “I took a 10:30 on Wednesday last week, and every single person stayed,” Larson Levey said. “I think 4 p.m. is going to be the new 7 p.m. when it comes to workouts.”
Joel Moore, owner of a golf club called the Ridge in New Jersey, found himself busier than ever in 2021. At one point, he and his wife looked at each other and realized what was driving their foot traffic: remote workers.
“We didn’t have a crystal ball to look into as we were budgeting for 2021 and 2022, and we were elated,” he said. “We’re seeing people during the week that we never saw before.”
There used to be a sizable portion of members whom Moore saw only on weekends, or occasionally on summer evenings when they came from the office and rushed into the locker room to change from dress shirts and blazers into polo shirts. Now many of his members, who include lawyers and pharmaceutical executives, wake up early in the morning to race through meetings so they can get to the golf course by lunch time.
“They’re not sneaking away,” he added. “They’re getting the work done, just not at your typical hours.”
Some golf course managers also noted that remote work had coincided with a push in the golfing world for shorter games. “Maybe people have a little bit more time, the interest is there and we’re able to morph the game a little bit to meet people’s schedules,” said Marshall Ormand, who manages a municipal golf course in Charleston, South Carolina.
Of course, many remote workers have reconfigured the shape of their workdays for the opposite of leisure: child care. People are working 28% more after the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, according to a report from Microsoft. For many working mothers, remote work didn’t initially bring any time for leisure. Mothers were more likely than fathers to be interrupted by family responsibilities while working from home, according to at least one study, a particular source of stress when schools were shut down because of COVID.
But now that schools are open, some workers are welcoming the opportunity to tackle errands during the weekday. Some of this extension of economic leisure is above board, as managers accept that people are rethinking their schedules.
Stephanie Cunningham, 27, who works in marketing, was sitting in CutLoose, the Brooklyn hair salon, waiting for an appointment on a Thursday afternoon. She said her boss has been supportive when she had to sign on earlier in the morning or later in the evening to get work done so that she could take a break to run errands, including grocery shopping and walking her dog.
“My boss allows me to take time for myself,” Cunningham said. “As long as I get my work done.”
Celiann Figueroa, 25, a stylist at CutLoose, said her weekdays were far busier than they were before the pandemic. She used to spend afternoons, at a different Brooklyn salon, waiting for her harried customers to leave the office. Now her noon to 4 p.m. slot is consistently full. Her daily appointment numbers have more than doubled.
Partly that’s because her clients are treating the salon like an office. “I’ve had a client sit outside with foils in her hair hosting a Zoom meeting,” she said, adding that she often has to adjust the position of people’s heads so they can look at their laptops while she styles their hair. “It’s funny seeing people sit up and try to be professional.”
And for some people straddling office and leisure, there’s a delight in the fusion. Tyler Kevorkian, the assistant general manager of Bouldering Project in Washington, D.C., said he had seen one person help run a gelato company from his gym. He has also seen government employees and lawyers writing memos steps away from the rock climbing walls.
“People just make this their office,” he said. “Sometimes when you’re working, you get antsy and anxious. You can go downstairs, do some pullups, sweat it out and then jump right back into a meeting.”
But plenty of business leaders are wary about this leisure-time expansion. In recent months, concerns about employee engagement have crept into executive commentary on remote work.
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which allowed many of its employees to work fully remote, voiced anxiety earlier this year about the effects of that decision: “We don’t have the same level of performance and productivity that we had in 2020 before the pandemic,” Benioff said.
At Amazon, Andy Jassy has been similarly emphatic about the benefits of in-person work: “When you’re in-person, people tend to be more engaged,” he wrote in a memo to employees last month. And at Jefferies, its chief executive, Rich Handler, and its president, Brian Friedman, sent a memo in the fall underscoring that they expected to see people in person: “It is abundantly clear that we need to be together as much as possible.”
But these executives are facing a workforce newly emboldened by the balance they’ve achieved between their work and personal life, whether that means family obligations or playing golf. Take Wade McDaniel, a vice president at Gartner, who is one of the golfers embracing the benefits of the afternoon fun economy. McDaniel, 62, said he was a different version of himself before remote work.
“I would have been defined as a classic workaholic — that showed up in poor health, poor relationship management,” he said.
Now, McDaniel starts work at 5 a.m. and gets to his local golf course in Phoenix by 3 p.m. “Unless there’s something that is semi critical going on, I don’t take my work phone with me,” he said. “The only reason I use my phone is for the golf app.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Can Unions Still Grow in California's Fields?: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Veronica Mota marched under the sweltering sun, hoisting a cloth banner of Our Lady of Guadalupe above her head for miles.
"Sí, se puede," she chanted in unison with dozens of other farmworkers, who waved U.S. and Mexican flags as they walked along two-lane roads lined by dense orange groves in the Central Valley of California.
The banner, flags and rallying cry -- "Yes, we can" -- echoed back more than half a century to when Cesar Chavez, a co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, led agricultural workers on a pilgrimage along a similar route to meet lawmakers in Sacramento.
"We are a legacy of Cesar Chavez," said Ms. Mota, 47, who, when blisters began to form on her feet during the 24-day trek in August, gathered strength by thinking of how the march in the 1960s led to groundbreaking farmworker reforms and propelled the U.F.W. to national prominence.
"We can achieve what we want," Ms. Mota said.
What the farmworkers wanted last summer was for Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign into law a bill that they argued would make it easier and less intimidating for workers to vote in union elections -- a key step, they believed, in rebuilding the size and influence of a now far less prolific U.F.W. But changing a rule is not the same as changing the game. The question now is whether the U.F.W. can show it has not irretrievably lost its organizing touch and can regain the ability to mobilize public opinion on its behalf as it did under Mr. Chavez.
The union is a shadow of what it was decades ago. Membership hovers around 5,500 farmworkers, less than 2 percent of the state's agricultural work force, compared with 60,000 in the 1970s. In the same period, the number of growers covered by U.F.W. contracts has fallen to 22 from about 150. The march last summer stood as a reckoning of sorts for a union desperate to regain its relevance.
Labor organizing has rebounded nationwide in the last few years, with unions winning elections at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island and at least 275 Starbucks stores, and among white-collar workers in the tech and media industries. But in California's fields, which supply about half of the produce grown in the United States for the domestic market, such efforts have found little traction.
It has been more than five years since the U.F.W. mounted an organizing drive and election petition in the state -- at Premiere Raspberries in Watsonville. The U.F.W. unionization vote succeeded, but the company refused to negotiate a contract and in 2020 announced plans to shut down and lay off more than 300 workers.
Ms. Mota, who has worked seasonal jobs around the state for two decades, has seen her wages drop by about $ 6,000 over the last several years. She is now earning around $ 15,000 a year. (The U.F.W. considers Ms. Mota a "member leader," and she has been on the union payroll in the past to compensate her for time taken from her farm work for union duties.) She said that on farms without union contracts, bosses sometimes make veiled threats about cutting hours, refuse to give workers breaks in 100-plus degree weather and turn a blind eye to dangerous conditions.
"Where we do not have a union contract, there is no respect," she said in Spanish on a recent morning from her ranch-style home in the farming town of Madera.
But the bill backed by Ms. Mota, which Mr. Newsom signed into law after the marchers arrived in Sacramento, has fueled a cautious optimism. Backers say the ability to more freely organize will help them gain more influence.
"There is new energy, new legislation and attention from the public in terms of workers' rights," said Christian Paiz, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, who has researched farm labor in the state. "We could be on the front lines of a renaissance."
The Shadow of Cesar Chavez
Farmworkers have, for generations and by design, existed on the fringes of the American work force.
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 excluded farm and domestic workers from federal protections -- a decision, rooted in racism, that ensured that the Black, Latino and Asian people whose work opportunities were largely limited to those two industries were not covered.
But by the 1960s, momentum for change was building.
Mr. Chavez, who was a farm laborer picking avocados and peas before becoming a grass-roots organizer, teamed up with Dolores Huerta, a young workers' rights activist from the Central Valley, and in 1962 they founded the National Farm Workers Association. It became the U.F.W.
Three years later, it was a key force behind the Delano grape workers' strike, in which thousands of Mexican and Filipino farmworkers walked off their jobs, demanding raises from $ 1.25 to $ 1.40 an hour, as well as elections that could pave the way for unionization.
As the striking farmworkers made their way along the 335-mile trek in 1966, which started in Delano, the group grew steadily, and other unions began to pledge their support.
In the Bay Area, longshoremen had refused to load shipments of grapes that hadn't been picked by unionized workers and, before long, a statewide pressure campaign had become a national one.
Weeks after the march began, a lawyer for Schenley Industries, a large Central Valley grape grower that was a target of the boycott, contacted Mr. Chavez, and the company soon agreed to negotiate a contract. It officially recognized the U.F.W., making it the first major corporation to acknowledge a farm union.
The grape workers' strike stretched into the summer of 1970, when widespread consumer boycotts forced major growers to sign on to collective bargaining agreements between the union and several thousand workers.
In the years that followed, Mr. Chavez forged a relationship with Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and helped champion the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, which established the right to collective bargaining for farmworkers and created a board to enforce the act and arbitrate labor fights between workers and growers. It was the first law in the country guaranteeing protections to farm workers.
But the union's gains soon began to erode. Mr. Brown's Republican successor, George Deukmejian, and his appointees made changes to the farm labor board in the 1980s and cut funding, arguing that the adjustments were necessary to correct an "easily perceived bias" in favor of farm workers and the U.F.W. and against growers. And even when the union has won elections, it has often faced legal challenges from growers that can drag on for years.
The law that Mr. Newsom signed last year, Assembly Bill 2183, was the union's biggest legislative victory in years. It paved the way for farmworkers to vote in union elections without in-person election sites. For years, U.F.W. officials argued that dwindling membership numbers stemmed from fears about voting in person at sites often held on properties owned by the growers.
The bill faced opposition from growers, who contended that the measure would allow union organizers to unfairly influence the process. Mr. Newsom initially voiced reticence, but signed the measure into law after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Biden publicly pushed him to do so.
"In the state with the largest population of farmworkers, the least we owe them is an easier path to make a free and fair choice to organize a union," Mr. Biden said at the time.
Supporters of the measure highlight how the demographics of farmworkers have changed over the years. In the 1970s, under Mr. Chavez, many farmworkers were U.S. citizens, but migration from Mexico and Central America in the decades that followed created a work force composed primarily of undocumented workers. Because they lack immigration papers, supporters say, they are especially vulnerable. (Undocumented workers can be covered by labor agreements.)
In signing the measure, Mr. Newsom and the U.F.W. agreed to support follow-up compromise legislation that would guard farmworker confidentiality during elections and place limits on card-check voting, a method in which employees sign cards in favor of unionizing.
'We Are Ignored'
Last summer, as she marched past vineyards and groves of mandarin oranges, Ms. Mota thought of the harvest cycle that has defined much of her life.
She reflected on the dormant season, in December and January, when she prunes pistachio and almond trees, and the rainy months, when it's sometimes hard to find work. But then comes the prosperous citrus and grape harvests, through the spring and the fall, which always make her think of the families who will eventually toast with wine squeezed from the fruit she plucked from the vine.
"I love for my hands to harvest a fruit and then seeing those fruits and vegetables in the restaurant," Ms. Mota said.
She thought, too, about the invisibility and dangers of her work -- the tiny teeth marks etched into her leather boot by a snake bite, the molehill where she badly sprained her ankle, the co-worker airlifted to San Francisco with injuries.
"We are ignored," she said.
Still, she didn't feel that way during the march, where in many towns people greeted them with snacks, Gatorade and full meals. While the group was in Stockton, an inland port city, Ms. Huerta, now 92, stood before the crowd wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the words, "Sí se puede."
"You all have made me so proud," she told them.
Ms. Huerta, who helped negotiate the first farmworker contract with Schenley, left U.F.W. leadership more than two decades ago to pursue other causes. But in an interview, she said the need for unionization remained as high as it was when she helped start the union.
"Farmworkers wanted the support and still want the support," said Ms. Huerta, who attributed the dearth of contracts to a refusal by growers to bargain in good faith.
Despite setbacks in recent decades, U.F.W. officials say they have continued to secure contracts that focus on health care benefits, wage increases and cultivating a respectful culture between farmworkers and employees. At Monterey Mushrooms, which has operated under a contract since the 1980s, U.F.W. officials say the average annual income for a mushroom picker is $ 45,000 and includes vacation time and a pension. (The statewide average for farmworkers is between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year, according to the U.S. Labor Department.)
"With a union contract, workers are educated about their rights and empowered to defend them," said Teresa Romero, the union's president.
Issues might vary from farm to farm, Ms. Romero said. "In one workplace it may be low wages, in another it may be unsafe conditions, in still another it may be the workplace culture -- having to pay bribes or endure sexual harassment to get work or having a particular supervisor who is racist or cruel," she said. "We understand the immense risks that workers are taking when speaking up on the job; it takes courage for workers to form their union."
Ms. Romero said she was confident that the new state law -- along with a streamlined federal process to protect workers involved in labor disputes surrounding immigration threats from employers -- would translate into more bargaining power and more contracts.
A Question of Strategy
Some labor watchers are skeptical of the union's ability to reinvigorate itself.
Miriam Pawel, an author who has written extensively about the union and Mr. Chavez, said the U.F.W.'s decline reflected a shortfall in organizing efforts in the communities where farmworkers live.
"It's evolved more into an advocacy organization and walked away from the more difficult work of organizing," Ms. Pawel said. Referring to the 1975 labor relations act, she added, "They have the most favorable labor law in the country and have barely taken advantage."
Ms. Pawel cited a 2016 state law mandating that agricultural employers pay overtime if people worked more than eight hours in a day. The union lobbied for the measure, but growers warned that they couldn't afford to pay overtime and would adjust schedules to avoid doing so. The new overtime rule has been phased in over the years, and some farmworkers have voiced anger about losing hours.
"If the union were stronger in the fields, and at organizing, it could have won elections and demanded better overtime provisions in contracts," Ms. Pawel said.
Ms. Romero pushed back against such criticism, arguing that, until Mr. Newsom signed A.B. 2183 in September, many farmworkers had justified fears that, if they sought unionization, their bosses would fire them or even try to get them deported.
Indeed, a report by the University of California, Merced, Community and Labor Center found that 36 percent of farmworkers said they would not file a report against their employer for failing to comply with workplace safety rules and that 64 percent cited fear of employer retaliation or job loss.
And since the bill's passage, the Farm Employers Labor Service, a trade group that staunchly opposed the law, has placed advertisements on Spanish-language radio stations, warning about what it means to be in a union. In one ad, a man shouts: "Signing a union petition can lead to the union stealing 3 percent of your salary! Do not let them!"
Those messages deeply concern Ms. Romero.
"Filing for an election when workers are not protected from genuine risks of retaliation will only lead already poor people into further hardship," she said. "This is the implicit threat that the growers' power depends on."
'They Just Want to Work'
Many California growers say they can be better bosses without unions.
On a recent afternoon off Interstate 5 in the small city of Firebaugh, Joe Del Bosque stared out at bare fields on the melon farm he has owned since 1985. A thick fog hung over the area, and the ground was puddled from rain water. It was the quiet season on the farm, where he employs more than 100 farmworkers annually.
Mr. Del Bosque said that when he was a boy, his parents, legal U.S. residents, traveled from a town near the California-Mexico border to the Central Valley to pick melons every summer. As a farm owner, he has never had a union contract, and aims to keep it that way.
He provides his employees with good conditions and fair wages, he said, without their having to pay union dues. "From my experience, workers who are moving around from season to season do not want the extra hands involved," he said of the union. "They just want to work."
He said he had little trouble finding field hands, including migrants who move from farm to farm with each season. And he noted that in the Salinas Valley -- closer to the coast, where housing is more expensive -- many growers rely on H-2A visas, which let them bring workers, often from Mexico, for just a few months of the year.
That impermanence, he said, works against the U.F.W. "If the workers are here only a few months a year and then leave the state, how are you going to organize?" he said.
Mr. Del Bosque said that he respected the U.F.W.'s history and the groundwork of Mr. Chavez and Ms. Huerta, but that he opposed A.B. 2183. The law, he contends, will allow the U.F.W. to unfairly sway farmworkers at their kitchen tables and behind closed doors.
"That's the intimidation factor," Mr. Del Bosque said.
A New Spirit of Activism
While the impact of the law remains unclear, it has buoyed the spirits of some farmworkers.
Asuncion Ponce started harvesting grapes along the rolling green hills of the Central Valley in the late 1980s. Through the decades, Mr. Ponce has worked on several farms with U.F.W. contracts. Bosses on those farms, he said, seemed aware that if they harassed or mistreated workers, the union would step in.
"They don't mess with you any more," he said, "because they think there could be problems."
Even so, he has seen his financial security decline. He averaged $ 20,000 a year in the 1990s and 2000s, he said, but these days he brings in around $ 10,000 a year picking grapes and pruning pistachio trees. His eight-hour shifts are no longer supplemented by overtime, as growers have cut hours -- partly as a result of the overtime bill U.F.W. leaders supported.
Occasionally, Mr. Ponce said, he relied on third-party contractors, who growers sometimes employ, to find him available work. But he said he was optimistic that with the new legislation he would land a full-time job on a union farm.
On a recent evening, the 66-year-old sipped coffee and decompressed after a shift at a farm outside of Fresno. His feet ached and his flannel shirt was stained with fertilizer, but he is happy that his job lets him spend all day outdoors -- a passion born in his hometown in the Mexican state of Puebla, where he harvested corn and anise.
He smiled softly under his white mustache as he spoke about the legacy of Mr. Chavez, which inspired him to join for several legs of the pilgrimage last summer.
"I marched for many reasons," he said in Spanish. "So we are not as harassed and mistreated as we are now in the fields, so benefits and better treatment come our way."
For Ms. Mota, joining the march helped awaken a new spirit of activism.
Over the years, she said, she felt afraid to talk about unionizing at work, but now she tells any colleagues who will listen about the advantages she sees: the ability to negotiate a better salary, benefits and a respect for seniority.
Her viewpoint was shaped in her early years as a farmworker. "Throughout the years I have realized that we are marginalized," she said. "They don't value us."
Once, she said, she watched as a farmer grabbed a knife used to harvest cantaloupe and put it to the cheek of another worker. He glared into the farmworker's eyes, she said, and called the workers his slaves.
"You feel humiliated," she said, fighting back tears.
She is convinced that having a strong union is the only answer. "We deserve a dignified life in this country," she said.

MADERA, Calif. — Veronica Mota marched under the sweltering sun, hoisting a cloth banner of Our Lady of Guadalupe above her head for miles.
“Sí, se puede,” she chanted in unison with dozens of other farmworkers, who waved U.S. and Mexican flags as they walked along two-lane roads lined by dense orange groves in the Central Valley of California.
The banner, flags and rallying cry — “Yes, we can” — echoed back more than half a century to when Cesar Chavez, co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, led agricultural workers on a pilgrimage along a similar route to meet lawmakers in Sacramento.
“We are a legacy of Cesar Chavez,” said Mota, 47, who, when blisters began to form on her feet during the 24-day trek in August, gathered strength by thinking of how the march in the 1960s led to groundbreaking farmworker reforms and propelled the UFW to national prominence.
“We can achieve what we want,” Mota said.
What the farmworkers wanted last summer was for Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign into law a bill that they argued would make it easier and less intimidating for workers to vote in union elections — a key step, they believed, in rebuilding the size and influence of a now far less prolific UFW. But changing a rule is not the same as changing the game. The question now is whether the UFW can show it has not irretrievably lost its organizing touch and can regain the ability to mobilize public opinion on its behalf as it did under Chavez.
The union is a shadow of what it was decades ago. Membership hovers around 5,500 farmworkers, less than 2% of the state’s agricultural workforce, compared with 60,000 in the 1970s. In the same period, the number of growers covered by UFW contracts has fallen to 22 from about 150. The march last summer stood as a reckoning of sorts for a union desperate to regain its relevance.
Labor organizing has rebounded nationwide in the past few years, with unions winning elections at an Amazon warehouse in New York and at least 275 Starbucks stores, and among white-collar workers in the tech and media industries. But in California’s fields, which supply about half of the produce grown in the United States for the domestic market, such efforts have found little traction.
It has been more than five years since the UFW mounted an organizing drive and election petition in the state — at Premiere Raspberries in Watsonville. The UFW unionization vote succeeded, but the company refused to negotiate a contract and in 2020 announced plans to shut down and lay off more than 300 workers.
Mota, who has worked seasonal jobs around the state for two decades, has seen her wages drop by about $6,000 over the past several years. She is now earning around $15,000 a year. She said that on farms without union contracts, bosses sometimes make veiled threats about cutting hours, refuse to give workers breaks in 100-plus-degree weather and turn a blind eye to dangerous conditions.
“Where we do not have a union contract, there is no respect,” she said in Spanish on a recent morning from her ranch-style home in the farming town of Madera.
But the bill backed by Mota, which Newsom signed into law after the marchers arrived in Sacramento, has fueled a cautious optimism. Backers say the ability to more freely organize will help them gain more influence.
“There is new energy, new legislation and attention from the public in terms of workers’ rights,” said Christian Paiz, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, who has researched farm labor in the state. “We could be on the front lines of a renaissance.”
The Shadow of Cesar Chavez
Farmworkers have, for generations and by design, existed on the fringes of the U.S. workforce.
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 excluded farm and domestic workers from federal protections — a decision, rooted in racism, that ensured that the Black, Latino and Asian people whose work opportunities were largely limited to those two industries were not covered.
But by the 1960s, momentum for change was building.
Chavez, who was a farm laborer picking avocados and peas before becoming a grassroots organizer, teamed up with Dolores Huerta, a young workers’ rights activist from the Central Valley, and in 1962 they founded the National Farm Workers Association. It became the United Farm Workers.
Three years later, it was a key force behind the Delano grape workers’ strike, in which thousands of Mexican and Filipino farmworkers walked off their jobs, demanding raises to $1.40 an hour from $1.25, as well as elections that could pave the way for unionization.
As the striking farmworkers made their way along the 335-mile trek in 1966, which started in Delano, the group grew steadily, and other unions began to pledge their support.
In the Bay Area, longshoremen had refused to load shipments of grapes that hadn’t been picked by unionized workers and, before long, a statewide pressure campaign had become a national one.
Weeks after the march began, a lawyer for Schenley Industries, a large Central Valley grape grower that was a target of the boycott, contacted Chavez, and the company soon agreed to negotiate a contract. It officially recognized the UFW, making it the first major corporation to acknowledge a farm union.
The grape workers’ strike stretched into the summer of 1970, when widespread consumer boycotts forced major growers to sign on to collective bargaining agreements between the union and several thousand workers.
In the years that followed, Chavez forged a relationship with Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and helped champion the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, which established the right to collective bargaining for farmworkers and created a board to enforce the act and arbitrate labor fights between workers and growers. It was the first law in the country guaranteeing protections to farmworkers.
But the union’s gains soon began to erode. Brown’s Republican successor, George Deukmejian, and his appointees made changes to the farm labor board in the 1980s and cut funding, arguing that the adjustments were necessary to correct an “easily perceived bias” in favor of farmworkers and the UFW and against growers. And even when the union has won elections, it has often faced legal challenges from growers that can drag on for years.
The law that Newsom signed last year, Assembly Bill 2183, was the union’s biggest legislative victory in years. It paved the way for farmworkers to vote in union elections without in-person election sites. For years, UFW officials argued that dwindling membership numbers stemmed from fears about voting in person at sites often held on properties owned by the growers.
The bill faced opposition from growers, who contended that the measure would allow union organizers to unfairly influence the process. Newsom initially voiced reticence but signed the measure into law after Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker at the time, and President Joe Biden publicly pushed him to do so.
“In the state with the largest population of farmworkers, the least we owe them is an easier path to make a free and fair choice to organize a union,” Biden said at the time.
Supporters of the measure highlight how the demographics of farmworkers have changed over the years. In the 1970s, under Chavez, many farmworkers were U.S. citizens, but migration from Mexico and Central America in the decades that followed created a workforce composed primarily of workers without legal status. Because they lack immigration papers, supporters say, they are especially vulnerable. (Undocumented workers can be covered by labor agreements.)
In signing the measure, Newsom and the UFW agreed to support follow-up compromise legislation that would guard farmworker confidentiality during elections and place limits on card-check voting, a method in which employees sign cards in favor of unionizing.
‘We Are Ignored’
Last summer, as she marched past vineyards and groves of mandarin oranges, Mota thought of the harvest cycle that has defined much of her life.
She reflected on the dormant season, in December and January, when she prunes pistachio and almond trees, and the rainy months, when it’s sometimes hard to find work. But then come the prosperous citrus and grape harvests, through the spring and the fall, which always make her think of the families who will eventually toast with wine squeezed from the fruit she plucked from the vine.
“I love for my hands to harvest a fruit and then seeing those fruits and vegetables in the restaurant,” Mota said.
She thought, too, about the invisibility and dangers of her work — the tiny teeth marks etched into her leather boot by a snake bite, the molehill where she badly sprained her ankle, the co-worker airlifted to San Francisco with injuries.
“We are ignored,” she said.
Still, she didn’t feel that way during the march, where in many towns people greeted them with snacks, Gatorade and full meals. While the group was in Stockton, an inland port city, Huerta, now 92, stood before the crowd wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “Sí se puede.”
“You all have made me so proud,” she told them.
Huerta, who helped negotiate the first farmworker contract with Schenley, left UFW leadership more than two decades ago to pursue other causes. But in an interview, she said the need for unionization remained as high as it was when she helped start the union.
“Farmworkers wanted the support and still want the support,” said Huerta, who attributed the dearth of contracts to a refusal by growers to bargain in good faith.
Despite setbacks in recent decades, UFW officials say they have continued to secure contracts that focus on health care benefits, wage increases, and cultivating a respectful culture between farmworkers and employees. At Monterey Mushrooms, which has operated under a contract since the 1980s, UFW officials say the average annual income for a mushroom picker is $45,000 and includes vacation time and a pension. (The statewide average for farmworkers is between $20,000 and $25,000 a year, according to the U.S. Labor Department.)
“With a union contract, workers are educated about their rights and empowered to defend them,” said Teresa Romero, the union’s president.
Issues might vary from farm to farm, Romero said. “In one workplace it may be low wages, in another it may be unsafe conditions, in still another it may be the workplace culture — having to pay bribes or endure sexual harassment to get work or having a particular supervisor who is racist or cruel,” she said. “We understand the immense risks that workers are taking when speaking up on the job; it takes courage for workers to form their union.”
Romero said she was confident that the new state law — along with a streamlined federal process to protect workers involved in labor disputes surrounding immigration threats from employers — would translate into more bargaining power and more contracts.
A Question of Strategy
Some labor watchers are skeptical of the union’s ability to reinvigorate itself.
Miriam Pawel, an author who has written extensively about the union and Chavez, said the UFW’s decline reflected a shortfall in organizing efforts in the communities where farmworkers live.
“It’s evolved more into an advocacy organization and walked away from the more difficult work of organizing,” Pawel said. Referring to the 1975 labor relations act, she added, “They have the most favorable labor law in the country and have barely taken advantage.”
Pawel cited a 2016 state law mandating that agricultural employers pay overtime if people worked more than eight hours in a day. The union lobbied for the measure, but growers warned that they couldn’t afford to pay overtime and would adjust schedules to avoid doing so. The new overtime rule has been phased in over the years, and some farmworkers have voiced anger about losing hours.
“If the union were stronger in the fields, and at organizing, it could have won elections and demanded better overtime provisions in contracts,” Pawel said.
Romero pushed back against such criticism, arguing that until Newsom signed AB 2183 in September, many farmworkers had justified fears that if they sought unionization, their bosses would fire them or try to get them deported.
Indeed, a report by the University of California, Merced, Community and Labor Center found that 36% of farmworkers said they would not file a report against their employer for failing to comply with workplace safety rules and that 64% cited fear of employer retaliation or job loss.
And since the bill’s passage, the Farm Employers Labor Service, a trade group that staunchly opposed the law, has placed advertisements on Spanish-language radio stations, warning about what it means to be in a union. In one ad, a man shouts: “Signing a union petition can lead to the union stealing 3% of your salary! Do not let them!”
Those messages deeply concern Romero.
“Filing for an election when workers are not protected from genuine risks of retaliation will only lead already poor people into further hardship,” she said. “This is the implicit threat that the growers’ power depends on.”
‘They Just Want to Work’
Many California growers say they can be better bosses without unions.
On a recent afternoon off Interstate 5 in the small city of Firebaugh, Joe Del Bosque stared out at bare fields on the melon farm he has owned since 1985. A thick fog hung over the area, and the ground was puddled from rain water. It was the quiet season on the farm, where he employs more than 100 farmworkers annually.
Del Bosque said that when he was a boy, his parents, legal U.S. residents, traveled from a town near the California-Mexico border to the Central Valley to pick melons every summer. As a farm owner, he has never had a union contract and aims to keep it that way.
He provides his employees with good conditions and fair wages, he said, without their having to pay union dues. “From my experience, workers who are moving around from season to season do not want the extra hands involved,” he said of the union. “They just want to work.”
He said he had little trouble finding field hands, including migrants who move from farm to farm with each season. And he noted that in the Salinas Valley — closer to the coast, where housing is more expensive — many growers rely on H-2A visas, which let them bring workers, often from Mexico, for just a few months of the year.
That impermanence, he said, works against the UFW. “If the workers are here only a few months a year and then leave the state, how are you going to organize?” he said.
Del Bosque said that he respected the UFW’s history and the groundwork of Chavez and Huerta, but that he opposed AB 2183. The law, he contends, will allow the UFW to unfairly sway farmworkers at their kitchen tables and behind closed doors. “ That’s the intimidation factor,” Del Bosque said.
A New Spirit of Activism
While the law’s impact remains unclear, it has buoyed the spirits of some farmworkers.
Asuncion Ponce started harvesting grapes along the rolling green hills of the Central Valley in the late 1980s. Through the decades, Ponce, 66, has worked on several farms with UFW contracts. Bosses on those farms, he said, seemed aware that if they harassed or mistreated workers, the union would step in.
“They don’t mess with you anymore,” he said, “because they think there could be problems.”
Even so, he has seen his financial security decline. He averaged $20,000 a year in the 1990s and 2000s, he said, but these days he brings in around $10,000 a year picking grapes and pruning pistachio trees. His eight-hour shifts are no longer supplemented by overtime, as growers have cut hours — partly as a result of the overtime bill that UFW leaders supported.
Occasionally, Ponce said, he relied on third-party contractors, whom growers sometimes employ, to find him available work. But he said he was optimistic that with the new legislation he would land a full-time job on a union farm.
On a recent evening, Ponce sipped coffee and decompressed after a shift at a farm outside of Fresno. His feet ached and his flannel shirt was stained with fertilizer, but he is happy that his job lets him spend all day outdoors — a passion born in his hometown in the Mexican state of Puebla, where he harvested corn and anise.
He smiled softly under his white mustache as he spoke about the legacy of Chavez, which inspired him to join for several legs of the pilgrimage last summer.
“I marched for many reasons,” he said in Spanish. “So we are not as harassed and mistreated as we are now in the fields, so benefits and better treatment come our way.”
For Mota, joining the march helped awaken a new spirit of activism.
Over the years, she said, she felt afraid to talk about unionizing at work, but now she tells any colleagues who will listen about the advantages she sees: the ability to negotiate a better salary, benefits and a respect for seniority.
Her viewpoint was shaped in her early years as a farmworker. “Throughout the years, I have realized that we are marginalized,” she said. “They don’t value us.”
Once, she said, she watched as a farmer grabbed a knife used to harvest cantaloupe and put it to the cheek of another worker. He glared into the farmworker’s eyes, she said, and called the workers his slaves.
“You feel humiliated,” she said, fighting back tears.
She is convinced that having a strong union is the only answer. “We deserve a dignified life in this country,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Carbon capture might not work for all buildings. But some are giving it a try.
GOOGLE DOC HERE
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yJJwSOM3LVesaxyZPAhBJRR3WBVLN-z3M5JlJ-UbVtM/edit On cold mornings in New York City, boilers in the basements of thousands of buildings kick on, burning natural gas or oil to provide heat for the people upstairs. Carbon dioxide from these boilers wafts up chimneys and into the air, one of the city's biggest sources of global warming emissions.
But there is one exception.
At the Grand Tier, a 30-story apartment tower on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the carbon dioxide from its two giant gas boilers is captured, cooled to a liquid and then trucked to a concrete factory in Brooklyn. There, the carbon is mixed with cement and sealed into concrete blocks, where it can't heat the atmosphere.
"This is the first carbon capture system on a building that we're aware of anywhere in the world," said Brian Asparro, the chief operating officer of CarbonQuest, the company behind the system. "And we expect that it won't be the last."
The building's owner, Glenwood Management, didn't install the technology purely out of concern for the planet. A sweeping new climate law in New York City aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from large buildings 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050. Starting next year, buildings that exceed emissions limits will face steadily escalating fines.
The law was designed to propel buildings to swap gas and oil for cleaner electric heating. But the costs and logistics of that shift can be extremely challenging. And that has turned New York City into a laboratory of sorts, forcing change and innovation as property owners scramble to avoid huge penalties.
***
The novel solution in the basement beneath the Grand Tier's marble lobby is easy to overlook. On a recent morning in a steamy room next to the parking garage, two industrial boilers roared to life as they burned natural gas for heat, just as they've done since the building opened in 2004.
But the hot exhaust from those boilers was funneled through a duct to a small, spotless room filled with pipes, rumbling compressors and metal tanks. Inside several of those tanks were dry absorbent materials that look like lentils and bind to carbon dioxide, allowing the machines to filter out other gases like nitrogen and oxygen. The remaining carbon dioxide was then chilled to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit and turned to liquid.
The equipment is similar to carbon capture machinery used at larger ethanol or natural gas processing plants. CarbonQuest's main innovation was shrinking the system for a residential property and designing it to run automatically, without constant human supervision.
"We want to make this as innocuous and as boring as we can," Mr. Asparro said.
The system currently captures about 60 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted by the Grand Tier's boilers, Mr. Asparro said. That reduces the building's overall emissions by about one-quarter, enough to meet the limits set by the new climate law. (The rest of the Grand Tier's emissions come from electricity consumption, which actually increased moderately to power CarbonQuest's compressors and cooling systems.)
But that still leaves the matter of what to do with the liquefied carbon dioxide. For the Grand Tier, the answer is concrete.
Every week or so, a small tanker truck pulls up to the Grand Tier and workers connect a hose to the side of the building that sucks out the liquid carbon with a loud hiss.
They truck it to Glenwood Mason Supply, a concrete manufacturer tucked beside a residential neighborhood in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. (No relation to Glenwood Management, which owns the Grand Tier.)
In a cavernous, clanking warehouse that used to be a brewery, Glenwood Mason makes thousands of concrete blocks per day used in construction all over the city. One tall stack of blocks outside was marked for an Amazon warehouse in Queens.
On this day, workers at the plant took the liquid carbon from the Grand Tier, used a new technique to convert the liquid into a powder resembling dry ice and dumped it into giant mixers, along with cement, sand and aggregate. The cement reacted with the carbon dioxide to turn it into a mineral, calcium carbonate, which was then sealed into concrete that was formed into blocks. Even if the blocks are later smashed up, the carbon dioxide can't escape.
"It creates this circular economy," said Jeff Hansen, vice president of architectural sales and marketing at Glenwood Mason. "We're taking carbon dioxide from a building in Manhattan, turning it into a block in Brooklyn and then sending that block out to build more structures in the city."
Some proponents of injecting carbon dioxide into concrete will claim that it can make the blocks stronger or reduce the amount of cement needed, but company officials say they haven't noticed a big difference so far. While they're paying for the carbon dioxide, they are not charging a premium for their blocks.
But there is a potential business case: Around the city, a younger generation of architects are interested in using "greener" materials for their buildings. New Jersey recently passed a law providing incentives for lower-carbon concrete. Glenwood Mason, which has been experimenting with a range of techniques to reduce the climate impact of its blocks, is trying to position itself as a pioneer in more sustainable concrete.
"We've never approached this as a big moneymaker, it's always been about sustainability for us," said Connie Cincotta, the owner of Glenwood Mason Supply. "But we do want to make this sustainable approach attractive for as many people as possible."
***
Questions remain about whether this elaborate carbon capture process makes sense as a strategy to fight climate change.
For Glenwood Management, which owns nearly 30 large buildings around the city, the technology has been a boon. Ahead of the new climate law, the company had made all the easy changes to save energy and reduce emissions: it replaced incandescent light bulbs with LEDs, upgraded old fan motors and improved insulation.
But it wasn't enough: The Grand Tier was set to face roughly $ 100,000 per year in fines starting in 2024, rising to $ 400,000 per year in 2030, because of those two giant carbon-spewing boilers in the basement.
The company explored replacing the boilers with electric heat pumps, a solution favored by environmentalists, but that posed serious challenges, said Josh London, a senior vice president at Glenwood Management. He was nervous about the building-wide renovations and rewiring that would be required and had questions about how well New York City's already-strained electric grid would hold up during the coldest days of winter, when heating demand spiked.
Capturing the carbon looked far simpler, he said. The company just had to clear six spots in the underground parking garage for CarbonQuest to install its equipment. And the boilers could keep burning gas.
"I'm not sure any of our tenants even noticed when we put the carbon capture system in," Mr. London said. "Whereas if we had to rewire the building, well, we do a lot of disruptive stuff but that would take the cake."
He sees electrified buildings powered by clean energy as the ultimate goal, but carbon capture can offer a "bridge" for now, he said. Glenwood Management is working to install carbon capture in at least five more of its buildings.
Mr. London wouldn't disclose what the company paid for the Grand Tier system but said it was cheaper than electrification and will pay for itself within six years through avoided penalties as well as the sale of hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide to Glenwood Mason. (Carbon dioxide can sell for more than $ 300 per ton.)
CarbonQuest officials are hoping to capitalize on the discomfort with electrification as the new climate law bites down. "We've been inundated by phone calls by people who have done electrification studies and said, this is too expensive, this is too difficult,," said Anna Pavlova, vice president for strategy and market development at CarbonQuest.
For now, however, carbon capture faces an enormous hurdle: It has not been approved by the city as a solution that complies with Local Law 97, since the technology didn't exist when the law was drafted. The Department of Buildings, which enforces the law, said it is reviewing CarbonQuest's system but has a number of questions, such as how to verify the emission reductions claimed by the Grand Tier.
"Until we know more about how this innovative technology is actually performing, and specifically, how and if the carbon is, in fact, being permanently sequestered, we cannot determine whether it is consistent with the intent of the law," said Andrew Rudansky, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings.
If CarbonQuest expands its business, it will have to persuade more concrete companies to stash all that carbon dioxide. Glenwood Mason has all it needs at the moment.
Experts and environmentalists point out electrification still has considerable advantages, like curbing indoor air pollution and being insulated from swings in gas prices. The technology is also improving quickly: New York State is currently funding a round of novel electric heat pump and efficiency projects that could serve as models for other buildings.
"The main way we decarbonize is still likely to be doing everything we can on energy efficiency, electrifying most buildings, and greening the grid," said John Mandyck, chief executive of the Urban Green Council, an umbrella group that includes real estate developers and environmentalists. "But we're still in the early stages of what's going to be a massive market transformation," he added. "The changes required are so big that I don't think we can rule out any approach just yet." 1: It starts with a building in Manhattan. The Grand Tier is a 30-story apartment tower on the Upper West Side.; 2: Its boilers release carbon dioxide. The building is heated by ordinary industrial boilers that burn natural gas.; 4: The liquefied CO2 is pumped outside the building, where once a week workers load it onto a tanker truck. The company that makes the carbon-capture system estimates that it traps about 60 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by the boilers.; 7: CO2 is converted to a solid that looks like dry ice. The material can be easily mixed with the cement, sand and aggregate.; 8: As it's mixed in, the powder turns into calcium carbonate. Even if the concrete block is later smashed, the carbon dioxide gas can't escape. (A12); 3: In a complicated process involving a lot of pipes, the carbon dioxide is captured, liquefied, and stored. Exhaust is filtered to remove gases like nitrogen and oxygen. And the remaining gas is chilled to 10 degrees below zero, which turns it into a liquid.; 5: Next stop: a concrete plant in Brooklyn. Every day, Glenwood Mason Supply makes thousands of concrete blocks.; 6: That's right. More pipes. Workers offload the liquefied gas, and prepare it to be used to make concrete.; 9: The resulting mixture is poured and shaped into blocks. Proponents say the resulting blocks are stronger, and less cement is needed. But officials at the plant haven't noticed much difference.; 10: A carbon-sequestering concrete block is born. The real value, officials said, might be sustainability as developers shift to "greener" materials.

MADERA, Calif. — Veronica Mota marched under the sweltering sun, hoisting a cloth banner of Our Lady of Guadalupe above her head for miles.
“Sí, se puede,” she chanted in unison with dozens of other farmworkers, who waved U.S. and Mexican flags as they walked along two-lane roads lined by dense orange groves in the Central Valley of California.
The banner, flags and rallying cry — “Yes, we can” — echoed back more than half a century to when Cesar Chavez, a founder of the United Farm Workers union, led agricultural workers on a pilgrimage along a similar route to meet lawmakers in Sacramento.
“We are a legacy of Cesar Chavez,” said Mota, 47, who, when blisters began to form on her feet during the 24-day trek in August, gathered strength by thinking of how the march in the 1960s led to groundbreaking farmworker reforms and propelled the union, known as UFW, to national prominence.
“We can achieve what we want,” Mota said.
What the farmworkers wanted last summer was for Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign into law a bill that they argued would make it easier and less intimidating for workers to vote in union elections — a key step, they believed, in rebuilding the UFW’s size and influence. But changing a rule is not the same as changing the game. The question now is whether the UFW can show it has not irretrievably lost its organizing touch and can regain the ability to mobilize public opinion on its behalf as it did under Chavez.
The union is a shadow of what it was decades ago. Membership hovers around 5,500 farmworkers, less than 2% of the state’s agricultural workforce, compared with 60,000 in the 1970s. In the same period, the number of growers covered by UFW contracts has fallen to 22 from about 150. The march last summer stood as a reckoning of sorts for a union desperate to regain its relevance.
Labor organizing has rebounded nationwide in the past few years, with unions winning elections at an Amazon warehouse in New York and at least 275 Starbucks stores, and among white-collar workers in the tech and media industries. But in California’s fields, which supply about half of the produce grown in the United States for the domestic market, such efforts have found little traction.
It has been more than five years since the UFW mounted an organizing drive and election petition in the state — at Premiere Raspberries in Watsonville. The UFW unionization vote succeeded, but the company refused to negotiate a contract and in 2020 announced plans to shut down and lay off more than 300 workers.
Mota, who has worked seasonal jobs around the state for two decades, has seen her wages drop by about $6,000 over the past several years. She is now earning around $15,000 a year. She said that on farms without union contracts, bosses sometimes make veiled threats about cutting hours, refuse to give workers breaks in 100-plus-degree weather and turn a blind eye to dangerous conditions.
“Where we do not have a union contract, there is no respect,” she said in Spanish on a recent morning from her ranch-style home in the farming town of Madera.
But the bill backed by Mota, which Newsom signed into law after the marchers arrived in Sacramento, has fueled a cautious optimism. Backers say the ability to more freely organize will help them gain more influence.
“There is new energy, new legislation and attention from the public in terms of workers’ rights,” said Christian Paiz, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, who has researched farm labor in the state. “We could be on the front lines of a renaissance.”
A Founder’s Shadow
Farmworkers have, for generations and by design, existed on the fringes of the U.S. workforce.
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 excluded farm and domestic workers from federal protections — a decision, rooted in racism, that ensured that the Black, Latino and Asian people whose work opportunities were largely limited to those two industries were not covered.
But by the 1960s, momentum for change was building.
Chavez, who was a farm laborer picking avocados and peas before becoming a grassroots organizer, teamed up with Dolores Huerta, a young workers’ rights activist from the Central Valley, and in 1962 they founded the National Farm Workers Association. It became the United Farm Workers.
Three years later, it was a key force behind the Delano grape workers’ strike, in which thousands of Mexican and Filipino farmworkers walked off their jobs, demanding raises to $1.40 an hour from $1.25, as well as elections that could pave the way for unionization.
As the striking farmworkers made their 335-mile trek in 1966, which started in Delano, the group grew steadily, and other unions began to pledge their support.
In the Bay Area, longshoremen had refused to load shipments of grapes that hadn’t been picked by unionized workers and, before long, a statewide pressure campaign had become a national one.
Weeks after the march began, a lawyer for Schenley Industries, a large Central Valley grape grower that was a target of the boycott, contacted Chavez, and the company soon agreed to negotiate a contract. It officially recognized the UFW, making it the first major corporation to acknowledge a farm union.
The grape workers’ strike stretched into the summer of 1970, when widespread consumer boycotts forced major growers to sign on to collective bargaining agreements between the union and several thousand workers.
In the years that followed, Chavez forged a relationship with Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and helped champion the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, which established the right to collective bargaining for farmworkers and created a board to enforce the act and arbitrate labor fights between workers and growers. It was the first law in the country guaranteeing protections to farmworkers.
But the union’s gains soon began to erode. Brown’s Republican successor, George Deukmejian, and his appointees made changes to the farm labor board in the 1980s and cut funding, arguing that the adjustments were necessary to correct an “easily perceived bias” in favor of farmworkers and the UFW and against growers. And even when the union has won elections, it has often faced legal challenges from growers that can drag on for years.
The law that Newsom signed last year, Assembly Bill 2183, was the union’s biggest legislative victory in years. It paved the way for farmworkers to vote in union elections without in-person election sites. For years, UFW officials argued that dwindling membership numbers stemmed from fears about voting in person at sites often held on properties owned by the growers.
The bill faced opposition from growers, who contended that the measure would allow union organizers to unfairly influence the process. Newsom initially voiced reluctance but signed the measure into law after Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker at the time, and President Joe Biden publicly pushed him to do so.
Supporters of the measure highlight how the demographics of farmworkers have changed over the years. In the 1970s, under Chavez, many farmworkers were U.S. citizens, but migration from Mexico and Central America in the decades that followed created a workforce composed primarily of workers without legal status. Because they lack immigration papers, supporters say, they are especially vulnerable. (Undocumented workers can be covered by labor agreements.)
In signing the measure, Newsom and the UFW agreed to support follow-up compromise legislation that would guard farmworker confidentiality during elections and place limits on card-check voting, a method in which employees sign cards in favor of unionizing.
‘We Are Ignored’
Last summer, as she marched past vineyards and groves of mandarin oranges, Mota thought of the harvest cycle that has defined much of her life.
She reflected on the dormant season, in December and January, when she prunes pistachio and almond trees, and the rainy months, when it’s sometimes hard to find work. But then come the prosperous citrus and grape harvests, through the spring and the fall, which always make her think of the families who will eventually toast with wine squeezed from the fruit she plucked from the vine.
“I love for my hands to harvest a fruit and then seeing those fruits and vegetables in the restaurant,” Mota said.
She thought, too, about the invisibility and dangers of her work — the tiny teeth marks etched into her leather boot by a snake bite, the molehill where she badly sprained her ankle, the co-worker airlifted to San Francisco with injuries.
“We are ignored,” she said.
Still, she didn’t feel that way during the march, where in many towns people greeted them with snacks, Gatorade and full meals. While the group was in Stockton, an inland port city, Huerta, now 92, stood before the crowd wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “Sí se puede.”
“You all have made me so proud,” she told them.
Huerta, who helped negotiate the first farmworker contract with Schenley, left UFW leadership more than two decades ago to pursue other causes. But in an interview, she said the need for unionization remained as high as it was when she helped start the union.
“Farmworkers wanted the support and still want the support,” said Huerta, who attributed the dearth of contracts to a refusal by growers to bargain in good faith.
Despite setbacks in recent decades, UFW officials say they have continued to secure contracts that focus on health care benefits, wage increases, and cultivating a respectful culture between farmworkers and employees. At Monterey Mushrooms, which has operated under a contract since the 1980s, UFW officials say the average annual income for a mushroom picker is $45,000 and includes vacation time and a pension. (The statewide average for farmworkers is between $20,000 and $25,000 a year, according to the U.S. Labor Department.)
“With a union contract, workers are educated about their rights and empowered to defend them,” said Teresa Romero, the union’s president.
Issues might vary from farm to farm, Romero said. “In one workplace it may be low wages, in another it may be unsafe conditions, in still another it may be the workplace culture — having to pay bribes or endure sexual harassment to get work or having a particular supervisor who is racist or cruel,” she said.
Romero said she was confident that the new state law — along with a streamlined federal process to protect workers involved in labor disputes surrounding immigration status — would translate into more bargaining power and more contracts.
A Question of Strategy
Some labor watchers are skeptical of the union’s ability to reinvigorate itself.
Miriam Pawel, an author who has written extensively about the union and Chavez, said the UFW’s decline reflected a shortfall in organizing efforts in the communities where farmworkers live.
“It’s evolved more into an advocacy organization and walked away from the more difficult work of organizing,” Pawel said. Referring to the 1975 labor relations act, she added, “They have the most favorable labor law in the country and have barely taken advantage.”
Pawel cited a 2016 state law mandating that agricultural employers pay overtime if people work more than eight hours in a day. The union lobbied for the measure, but growers warned that they couldn’t afford to pay overtime and would adjust schedules to avoid doing so. The new overtime rule has been phased in over the years, and some farmworkers have voiced anger about losing hours.
“If the union were stronger in the fields, and at organizing, it could have won elections and demanded better overtime provisions in contracts,” Pawel said.
Romero pushed back against such criticism, arguing that until Newsom signed AB 2183 in September, many farmworkers had justified fears that if they sought unionization, their bosses would fire them or try to get them deported.
Indeed, a report by the University of California, Merced, Community and Labor Center found that 36% of farmworkers said they would not file a report against their employer for failing to comply with workplace safety rules and that 64% cited fear of employer retaliation or job loss.
And since the bill’s passage, the Farm Employers Labor Service, a trade group that staunchly opposed the law, has placed advertisements on Spanish-language radio stations, warning about what it means to be in a union. In one ad, a man shouts: “Signing a union petition can lead to the union stealing 3% of your salary! Do not let them!”
‘They Just Want to Work’
Many California growers say they can be better bosses without unions.
On a recent afternoon off Interstate 5 in the small city of Firebaugh, Joe Del Bosque stared out at bare fields on the melon farm he has owned since 1985. A thick fog hung over the area, and the ground was puddled from rain water. It was the quiet season on the farm, where he employs more than 100 farmworkers annually.
Del Bosque said that when he was a boy, his parents, legal U.S. residents, traveled from a town near the California-Mexico border to the Central Valley to pick melons every summer. As a farm owner, he has never had a union contract and aims to keep it that way.
He provides his employees with good conditions and fair wages, he said, without their having to pay union dues. “From my experience, workers who are moving around from season to season do not want the extra hands involved,” he said of the union. “They just want to work.”
He said he had little trouble finding field hands, including migrants who move from farm to farm with each season. And he noted that in the Salinas Valley — closer to the coast, where housing is more expensive — many growers rely on H-2A visas, which let them bring workers, often from Mexico, for just a few months of the year.
That impermanence, he said, works against the UFW. “If the workers are here only a few months a year and then leave the state, how are you going to organize?” he said.
Del Bosque said that he respected the UFW’s history and the groundwork of Chavez and Huerta, but that he opposed AB 2183. The law, he contends, will allow the UFW to unfairly sway farmworkers at their kitchen tables and behind closed doors. “ That’s the intimidation factor,” Del Bosque said.
New Spirit of Activism
While the law’s impact remains unclear, it has buoyed the spirits of some farmworkers.
Asuncion Ponce started harvesting grapes along the rolling green hills of the Central Valley in the late 1980s. Through the decades, Ponce, 66, has worked on several farms with UFW contracts. Bosses on those farms, he said, seemed aware that if they harassed or mistreated workers, the union would step in.
“They don’t mess with you anymore,” he said, “because they think there could be problems.”
Even so, he has seen his financial security decline. He averaged $20,000 a year in the 1990s and 2000s, he said, but these days he brings in around $10,000 a year picking grapes and pruning pistachio trees. His eight-hour shifts are no longer supplemented by overtime, as growers have cut hours.
Occasionally, Ponce said, he relied on third-party contractors, whom growers sometimes employ, to find him available work. But he said he was optimistic that with the new legislation he would land a full-time job on a union farm.
On a recent evening, Ponce sipped coffee and decompressed after a shift at a farm outside of Fresno. His feet ached and his flannel shirt was stained with fertilizer, but he said he was happy that his job let him spend all day outdoors — a passion born in his hometown in the Mexican state of Puebla, where he harvested corn and anise.
He smiled softly under his white mustache as he spoke about the legacy of Chavez, which inspired him to join for several legs of the pilgrimage last summer.
“I marched for many reasons,” he said in Spanish. “So we are not as harassed and mistreated as we are now in the fields, so benefits and better treatment come our way.”
For Mota, joining the march helped awaken a new spirit of activism.
Over the years, she said, she felt afraid to talk about unionizing at work, but now she tells any colleagues who will listen about the advantages she sees: the ability to negotiate a better salary, benefits and a respect for seniority.
Once, she said, she watched as a farmer grabbed a knife used to harvest cantaloupe and put it to the cheek of another worker. He glared into the farmworker’s eyes, she said, and called the workers his slaves.
“You feel humiliated,” she said, fighting back tears.
She is convinced that having a strong union is the only answer. “We deserve a dignified life in this country,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

In Tower’s Basement, an Idea That Locks Pollution Away Forever

NEW YORK — On cold mornings in New York City, boilers in the basements of thousands of buildings kick on, burning natural gas or oil to provide heat for the people upstairs. Carbon dioxide from these boilers wafts up chimneys and into the air, one of the city’s biggest sources of global warming emissions.
But there is one exception.
At the Grand Tier, a 30-story apartment tower on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, the carbon dioxide from its two giant gas boilers is captured, cooled to a liquid and then trucked to a concrete factory in Brooklyn. There, the carbon is mixed with cement and sealed into concrete blocks, where it can’t heat the atmosphere.
“This is the first carbon capture system on a building that we’re aware of anywhere in the world,” said Brian Asparro, the chief operating officer of CarbonQuest, the company behind the system. “And we expect that it won’t be the last.”
The building’s owner, Glenwood Management, didn’t install the technology purely out of concern for the planet. A sweeping new climate law in New York City aims to cut greenhouse gases from large buildings 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Starting next year, buildings that exceed emissions limits will face steadily escalating fines.
The law was designed to propel buildings to swap gas and oil for cleaner electric heating. But the costs and logistics of that shift can be extremely challenging. And that has turned New York City into a laboratory of sorts, forcing change and innovation as property owners scramble to avoid huge penalties.
The novel solution in the basement beneath the Grand Tier’s marble lobby is easy to overlook. On a recent morning in a steamy room next to the parking garage, two industrial boilers roared to life as they burned natural gas for heat, just as they’ve done since the building opened in 2004.
But the hot exhaust from those boilers was funneled through a duct to a small, spotless room filled with pipes, rumbling compressors and metal tanks. Inside several of those tanks were dry absorbent materials that look like lentils and bind to carbon dioxide, allowing the machines to filter out other gases like nitrogen and oxygen. The remaining carbon dioxide was then chilled to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit and turned to liquid.
The equipment is similar to carbon capture machinery used at larger ethanol or natural gas processing plants. CarbonQuest’s main innovation was shrinking the system for a residential property and designing it to run automatically, without constant human supervision.
“We want to make this as innocuous and as boring as we can,” Asparro said.
The system currently captures about 60% of the carbon dioxide emitted by the Grand Tier’s boilers, Asparro said. That reduces the building’s overall emissions by about one-quarter, enough to meet the limits set by the new climate law. (The rest of the Grand Tier’s emissions come from electricity consumption, which actually increased moderately to power CarbonQuest’s compressors and cooling systems.)
But that still leaves the matter of what to do with the liquefied carbon dioxide. For the Grand Tier, the answer is concrete.
Every week or so, a small tanker truck pulls up to the Grand Tier and workers connect a hose to the side of the building that sucks out the liquid carbon with a loud hiss.
They truck it to Glenwood Mason Supply, a concrete manufacturer tucked beside a residential neighborhood in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. (No relation to Glenwood Management, which owns the Grand Tier.)
In a cavernous, clanking warehouse that used to be a brewery, Glenwood Mason makes thousands of concrete blocks per day used in construction all over the city. One tall stack of blocks outside was marked for an Amazon warehouse in Queens.
On this day, workers at the plant took the liquid carbon from the Grand Tier, used a new technique to convert the liquid into a powder resembling dry ice and dumped it into giant mixers, along with cement, sand and aggregate. The cement reacted with the carbon dioxide to turn it into a mineral, calcium carbonate, which was then sealed into concrete that was formed into blocks. Even if the blocks are later smashed up, the carbon dioxide can’t escape.
“It creates this circular economy,” said Jeff Hansen, vice president for architectural sales and marketing of Glenwood Mason. “We’re taking carbon dioxide from a building in Manhattan, turning it into a block in Brooklyn and then sending that block out to build more structures in the city.”
Some proponents of injecting carbon dioxide into concrete claim that it can make the blocks stronger or reduce the amount of cement needed, but company officials say they haven’t noticed a big difference so far. While they’re paying for the carbon dioxide, they are not charging a premium for their blocks.
But there is a potential business case: Around the city, a younger generation of architects are interested in using “greener” materials for their buildings. New Jersey recently passed a law providing incentives for lower-carbon concrete. Glenwood Mason, which has been experimenting with a range of techniques to reduce the climate impact of its blocks, is trying to position itself as a pioneer in more sustainable concrete.
“We’ve never approached this as a big moneymaker, it’s always been about sustainability for us,” said Connie Cincotta, the owner of Glenwood Mason Supply. “But we do want to make this sustainable approach attractive for as many people as possible.”
Questions remain about whether this elaborate carbon capture process makes sense as a strategy to fight climate change.
For Glenwood Management, which owns nearly 30 large buildings around the city, the technology has been a boon. Ahead of the new climate law, the company had made all the easy changes to save energy and reduce emissions: it replaced incandescent light bulbs with LEDs, upgraded old fan motors and improved insulation.
But it wasn’t enough: The Grand Tier was set to face roughly $100,000 per year in fines starting in 2024, rising to $400,000 per year in 2030, because of those two giant carbon-spewing boilers in the basement.
The company explored replacing those boilers with electric heat pumps, a solution favored by environmentalists, but that posed serious challenges, said Josh London, a senior vice president at Glenwood Management. He was nervous about the building-wide renovations and rewiring that would be required and had questions about how well New York City’s already-strained electric grid would hold up during the coldest days of winter, when heating demand spiked.
Capturing the carbon looked far simpler, he said. The company just had to clear six spots in the underground parking garage for CarbonQuest to install its equipment. And the boilers could keep burning gas.
“I’m not sure any of our tenants even noticed when we put the carbon capture system in,” London said. “Whereas if we had to rewire the building, well, we do a lot of disruptive stuff but that would take the cake.”
He sees electrified buildings powered by clean energy as the ultimate goal, but carbon capture can offer a “bridge” for now, he said. Glenwood Management is working to install carbon capture in at least five more of its buildings.
London wouldn’t disclose what the company paid for the Grand Tier system but said it was cheaper than electrification and will pay for itself within six years through avoided penalties as well as the sale of hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide to Glenwood Mason. (Carbon dioxide can sell for more than $300 per ton.)
CarbonQuest officials are hoping to capitalize on the discomfort with electrification as the new climate law bites down. “We’ve been inundated by phone calls by people who have done electrification studies and said, this is too expensive, this is too difficult,” said Anna Pavlova, vice president for strategy and market development at CarbonQuest.
For now, however, carbon capture faces an enormous hurdle: It has not been approved by the city as a solution that complies with Local Law 97, since the technology didn’t exist when the law was drafted. The Department of Buildings, which enforces the law, said it is reviewing CarbonQuest’s system but has a number of questions, such as how to verify the emission reductions claimed by the Grand Tier.
“Until we know more about how this innovative technology is actually performing, and specifically, how and if the carbon is, in fact, being permanently sequestered, we cannot determine whether it is consistent with the intent of the law,” said Andrew Rudansky, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings.
If CarbonQuest expands its business, it will have to persuade more concrete companies to stash all that carbon dioxide. Glenwood Mason has all it needs at the moment.
Experts and environmentalists point out electrification still has considerable advantages, like curbing indoor air pollution and being insulated from swings in gas prices. The technology is also improving quickly: New York state is currently funding a round of novel electric heat pump and efficiency projects that could serve as models for other buildings.
“The main way we decarbonize is still likely to be doing everything we can on energy efficiency, electrifying most buildings, and greening the grid,” said John Mandyck, chief executive of the Urban Green Council, an umbrella group that includes real estate developers and environmentalists. “But we’re still in the early stages of what’s going to be a massive market transformation,” he added. “The changes required are so big that I don’t think we can rule out any approach just yet.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

If Just Frozen Isn't Enough, Try Luxury Ice: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Nobody loves ice more than Americans. It's a running joke, a quirk of the national personality: Iced drinks are as American as rock 'n' roll, pickup trucks and to-go cups.
Way back in 1895, Mark Twain wrote that ice had become so inextricably linked with the United States that "there is but a single specialty with us, only one thing that can be called by the wide name 'American.' That is the national devotion to ice-water."
For years to come, all ice was good ice. But now it's entering a new Gilded Age. Frozen water, which costs most Americans virtually nothing, is being redefined as a luxury item.
At fashion-brand parties, ice cubes stamped with the company's logo are de rigueur. On tables at high-end weddings, fairy lights in Mason jars are out and wildflowers suspended in $ 14 ice cubes are in. TikTok creators routinely draw 30 million views overnight (and sizable paychecks) by showing off stocked ice drawers, along with retail links for buying specialty ice molds in all shapes and sizes. Then there's the pinnacle of domestic opulence: a countertop ice maker that turns out the pebble-shaped "nugget ice" previously available only at fast-food chains.
"I have almost 75 ice molds," said Kami Mehta, a TikToker who late last year started sharing the dozens of types of ice in her Florida freezer. Since then several other influencers have followed suit, drawing a huge audience: Ice isn't just frozen water for your drink, it's a blank canvas for your artistry.
"It's amazing how many people are doing it," she said of the videos. "You have to be creative now."
We could have seen it coming. First there were the refrigerators that plop crescent ice out the front of the door (and often onto the floor). Then came the chic 1¼-inch cubes made with silicone molds. In cocktail bars around the country, "on the rocks" now means having your favorite spirit poured over an extra-large sphere or cube of ice, and cloudy ice in a cocktail may warrant a complaint.
In 2020, 51 percent of the 2,000 Americans polled by the appliance company Bosch self-identified as "ice obsessed." Even more said that they wouldn't drink water unless it was cold, and that if no ice was available they would simply drink less water.
As in so many arenas of culture, TikTok is leading the way. In the past year, #icetok, a hashtag with nearly 950 million views, has become a social media phenomenon. Videos posted under the tag include tutorials for making "powdery ice," and the pouring of all manner of liquids into ice machines. (Say hello to hot-sauce ice, SpaghettiOs ice and, perhaps as an antidote, Pepto Bismol ice.)
But most popular among the TikTok genre is the subgenre of ice-drawer restock videos, which are themselves an offshoot of the strangely soothing #cleantok mania that swept social media through the pandemic. Restock videos, which show users decanting spices into jars and replenishing clear canisters with pantry goods, appeal to a large audience who crave organization or the comfort of repetition. The genre gets highly specific: guest bathroom restocks, coffee restocks and snack drawer restocks.
During the pandemic, "I think some people made sourdough and kimchi, and other people made ice cubes," said Camper English, a cocktail writer and ice obsessive best known for introducing a technique for making crystal-clear ice to cocktail connoisseurs about a decade ago.
"I know there's been a steady increase, but some switch flipped in the past six months," Mr. English said. "I feel like it's everywhere, particularly with those videos."
Here's what one ice restock video looks like: An empty freezer drawer slides open and a pair of hands, in this case belonging to Ms. Mehta, slides in plastic containers. Then 13 types of ice cascade into each bin. First, ice in spheres, tiny rectangles, large cubes and heart shapes. Then the colorful ice: cubes the size of ring boxes filled with slices of orange and lime; pink bricks of blended fruit ice for smoothies; creamy hazel-colored ice made with frozen coffee in the shapes of roses, pumpkins and bulldogs. The video, posted in September, has more than 17 million views.
Most of the tens of thousands of comments below the video fall into one of three categories: confusion ("Why do you have all this ice?"), joy ("The absolute serotonin this brought me") and envy ("I think we are in different tax brackets"). Even for skeptical viewers, it's an irresistible watch, tickling the A.S.M.R. corners of the brain. But unlike viral A.S.M.R. videos of wooden balls clacking in soup bowls or the supple crunch of Kinetic Sand, this one replays something every viewer is already familiar with: the sound of ice clattering in a freezer.
"It's a fascinating thing that's part of our daily life," said Leslie Kirchhoff, the founder of Disco Cubes, a four-year-old custom ice company in Los Angeles. "And you can make it as exciting or as normal as you want."
For Ms. Kirchhoff, ice presented itself as an untapped market for creativity. "Baby me had always wanted to be an inventor," she said, "and that came rushing back when I realized nobody was doing anything cool with ice." Under the Disco Cubes banner, she creates custom ice for brand-sponsored events and private parties.
After learning Mr. English's method for making clear ice, Ms. Kirchhoff developed her own way of suspending objects -- mostly flowers, produce and die-cut logos -- in ice, a "pretty intense" procedure, she said, that "takes three very specifically timed steps over three days." She closely guards her process, and charges a steep price: "The lowest we'll go for floral spheres is $ 8 per sphere," she said. For a suspended logo or a pricier flower, the tab starts at $ 14.
Americans have been commodifying ice for centuries.
"America has the oldest ice industry in the world," said Jonathan Rees, a professor of history at Colorado State University-Pueblo who has published three books about the development of American refrigeration. The nation's ice industry was begun in 1806 by Frederic Tudor, who "deliberately cultivated a market for ice -- he would give it away to bars, then get people hooked on it, and sell it."
By 1860, Dr. Rees said, Americans had developed a taste for ice year-round. Before the advent of freezers, ice was cut from ponds and lakes in colder regions and shipped to warmer climates, as far as Hawaii. By 1875, the ice man was a ubiquitous figure, going door-to-door to fill the iceboxes in "every house, from the richest to the poorest," he said. Electric household refrigeration was perfected in 1925, and the advent of ice-cube trays quickly followed.
Today the same technology is still in use, but ice-making is evolving.
Many ice lovers, rather than buying dozens of molds or learning time-intensive techniques, are simply investing in more sophisticated appliances. In 2019, the South Korean electronics giant LG released a fridge equipped with a freezer that dispenses what the company calls Craft Ice, including cubed ice, crushed ice and clear spherical ice balls -- allowing consumers to entertain, as the ads put it, "like a baller."
Kristen Seninger, a marketing program manager in San Francisco, bought a GE Profile Opal Nugget Countertop Ice Maker almost five years ago, and gained a social media following as the self-proclaimed "pebble ice queen." After GE Appliances "saw how viral my ice-maker stuff was going and how I would talk about it so frequently," she said, "they gifted me the 2.0." That model retails for nearly $ 700 and is a darling of #icetok.
"Tons of my followers have bought the ice maker because of my ice influence," said Ms. Seninger, who receives a portion of the sales revenue made through her Amazon and LTK storefronts. So far, she has sold 200 of the appliances.
Dr. Rees, the historian, thinks there's something distinctly American about splurging on ice. "We're willing to spend on something that's essentially free -- that's a sign that we value it."

Hubble Telescope Faces Threat From SpaceX and Other Companies’ Satellites

The Hubble Space Telescope, known for recording awe-inspiring images of the cosmos while advancing the field of astronomy, is under threat.
Private companies are launching thousands of satellites that are photobombing the telescope — producing long bright streaks and curves of light that can be impossible to remove. And the problem is only getting worse.
A study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, reveals an increase in the percentage of images recorded by the Hubble that are spoiled by passing satellites. And the data goes only through 2021. Thousands more satellites have been launched since then by SpaceX and other companies, and many more are expected to go to orbit in the years ahead, affecting the Hubble and potentially other telescopes in space.
“We’re going to be living with this problem. And astronomy will be impacted,” said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the study. “There will be science that can’t be done. There will be science that’s significantly more expensive to do. There will be things that we miss.”
The Hubble Space Telescope’s legacy cannot be overstated. Because of the observatory, we now know, for example, that the universe is 13.8 billion years old, that most galaxies contain a supermassive black hole at their centers and that stars form in violent processes. The Hubble’s images — including the gorgeous clouds of gas and dust in the “pillars of creation” and the view of nearly 10,000 galaxies in the “Hubble ultra deep field” — never fail to inspire.
But the number of satellites in orbit has significantly increased since the Hubble launched in 1990, and now it is staring at the cosmos through a field of satellites.
In May 2019, SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlink satellites, designed to broadcast internet signals across the globe. Soon after, an outcry emerged among astronomers who were concerned that Starlink’s streaks would jeopardize a number of campaigns to observe the universe from telescopes on Earth.
In response, Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, suggested that astronomers bypass the issue by moving telescopes to orbit.
But Hubble, which lives in low-Earth orbit roughly 335 miles above Earth’s surface, actually resides less than 10 miles below most Starlink satellites. That means that the observatory and other orbital space telescopes are still facing interference from satellite constellations. “Not only do you have to put your telescopes in space, but you also have to put them above all the other traffic,” McDowell said.
“I think we’ll be forced to do that in the decades to come,” he said. But that isn’t possible for current telescopes in low-Earth orbit or spacecraft that governments are building and launching in the coming years.
To quantify the effect of satellite constellations on Hubble, Sandor Kruk, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and his colleagues analyzed an archive of images taken from 2002 through 2021.
They had help from hundreds of citizen scientists who pored through images to tag those with clear satellite streaks. That data set was then used as a training set for a machine-learning algorithm that analyzed more than 100,000 individual Hubble photos. Their results show that the chance of seeing a satellite in a Hubble image from 2009 to 2020 is only 3.7%. But the chance of seeing one in 2021 is 5.9% — an increase that they say corresponds to Starlink. By the date of the analysis, 1,562 Starlink satellites were in orbit. Another company, OneWeb, had lofted 320 satellites.
Mark McCaughrean, an astronomer at the European Space Agency and a co-author on the new study, is confident in their analysis but notes that this is only a minor issue at the moment. Typically, Hubble takes multiple images that are stacked on top of one another — a technique that will erase any satellites.
And NASA agrees. “While such analyses may show a gradual increase in detected satellite trails over time, most of these streaks are readily removed using standard data reduction techniques, and the majority of affected images are still usable,” a spokesperson said in regard to the latest study. “Satellite streaks do not currently pose a significant threat to Hubble’s science efficiency and data analysis.”
That threat is higher when the Hubble surveys a large swath of the sky. Then it might take only one or two images before redirecting its camera. If a satellite photobombs one of those images, the image might have to be tossed.
In addition, the satellites could pose a serious threat to a telescope that hasn’t launched yet. At the end of this year, China plans to send Xuntian, also known as the Chinese Survey Space Telescope, into low-Earth orbit. Xuntian will have a larger field of view than Hubble, making it much harder for satellites to slip by undetected.
“It’s going to be very severely affected by these satellites right off the bat,” McDowell said.
And Xuntian can’t simply launch into a higher orbit. China’s plan is for the telescope to share an orbit with the Tiangong space station so that astronauts can refurbish it if necessary.
A spokesperson from SpaceX declined to comment on the new study but pointed toward the company’s past efforts to mitigate the effects of Starlink. The company has tried a variety of methods to darken its satellites, including a mirror film designed to direct light away from the ground. But Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist at Queen’s University Belfast who was not involved in the study, worries that the light will be directed up instead and could potentially worsen the situation for space-based telescopes.
There are simply too many unknowns at the moment, including the ultimate number of satellites.
SpaceX hopes to eventually expand the size of its fleet to 42,000 Starlink satellites. Many other companies are in the market, too: Amazon, the British satellite provider OneWeb, a Chinese company called Galaxy Space, and even governments. A combined 431,713 satellites are planned to launch in the coming years.
“It’s a bit of a feeding frenzy at the moment,” McCaughrean said.
That estimate is based on filings with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the International Telecommunication Union. But even if only 100,000 satellites launched, that would increase the number of satellites in orbit by a factor of 10 since the new study took place — meaning that roughly 50% of Hubble’s images would spot a satellite. And if every other image had a satellite streak, the researchers worry about how much usable science could be gathered.
“When will Hubble not be useful anymore?” McCaughrean asked. “That might be 10 or 20 years away, but it’s not inconceivable that there’s a point at which you say, ‘Let’s not bother anymore.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Height of Domestic Luxury? Designer Ice.

Nobody loves ice more than Americans. It’s a running joke, a quirk of the national personality: Iced drinks are as American as rock ’n’ roll, pickup trucks and to-go cups.
Way back in 1895, Mark Twain wrote that ice had become so inextricably linked with the United States that “there is but a single specialty with us, only one thing that can be called by the wide name ‘American.’ That is the national devotion to ice-water.”
For years to come, all ice was good ice. But now it’s entering a new Gilded Age. Frozen water, which costs most Americans virtually nothing, is being redefined as a luxury item.
At fashion-brand parties, ice cubes stamped with the company’s logo are de rigueur. On tables at high-end weddings, fairy lights in Mason jars are out and wildflowers suspended in $14 ice cubes are in. TikTok creators routinely draw 30 million views overnight (and sizable paychecks) by showing off stocked ice drawers, along with retail links for buying specialty ice molds in all shapes and sizes. Then there’s the pinnacle of domestic opulence: a countertop ice maker that turns out the pebble-shaped “nugget ice” previously available only at fast-food chains.
“I have almost 75 ice molds,” said Kami Mehta, a TikToker who late last year started sharing the dozens of types of ice in her Florida freezer. Since then several other influencers have followed suit, drawing a huge audience: Ice isn’t just frozen water for your drink, it’s a blank canvas for your artistry.
“It’s amazing how many people are doing it,” she said of the videos. “You have to be creative now.”
We could have seen it coming. First there were the refrigerators that plop crescent ice out the front of the door (and often onto the floor). Then came the chic 1 1/4-inch cubes made with silicone molds. In cocktail bars around the country, “on the rocks” now means having your favorite spirit poured over an extra-large sphere or cube of ice, and cloudy ice in a cocktail may warrant a complaint.
In 2020, 51% of the 2,000 Americans polled by the appliance company Bosch self-identified as “ice obsessed.” Even more said they wouldn’t drink water unless it was cold, and that if no ice was available they would simply drink less water.
As in so many arenas of culture, TikTok is leading the way. In the past year, #icetok, a hashtag with nearly 950 million views, has become a social media phenomenon. Videos posted under the tag include tutorials for making “powdery ice,” and the pouring of all manner of liquids into ice machines. (Say hello to hot-sauce ice, SpaghettiOs ice and, perhaps as an antidote, Pepto Bismol ice.)
But most popular among the TikTok genre is the subgenre of ice-drawer restock videos, which are themselves an offshoot of the strangely soothing #cleantok mania that swept social media through the pandemic. Restock videos, which show users decanting spices into jars and replenishing clear canisters with pantry goods, appeal to a large audience who crave organization or the comfort of repetition. The genre gets highly specific: guest bathroom restocks, coffee restocks and snack drawer restocks.
During the pandemic, “I think some people made sourdough and kimchi, and other people made ice cubes,” said Camper English, a cocktail writer and ice obsessive best known for introducing a technique for making crystal-clear ice to cocktail connoisseurs about a decade ago.
“I know there’s been a steady increase, but some switch flipped in the past six months,” English said. “I feel like it’s everywhere, particularly with those videos.”
Here’s what one ice restock video looks like: An empty freezer drawer slides open and a pair of hands, in this case belonging to Mehta, slides in plastic containers. Then 13 types of ice cascade into each bin. First, ice in spheres, tiny rectangles, large cubes and heart shapes. Then the colorful ice: cubes the size of ring boxes filled with slices of orange and lime; pink bricks of blended fruit ice for smoothies; creamy hazel-colored ice made with frozen coffee in the shapes of roses, pumpkins and bulldogs. The video, posted in September, has more than 17 million views.
Most of the tens of thousands of comments below the video fall into one of three categories: confusion (“Why do you have all this ice?”), joy (“The absolute serotonin this brought me”) and envy (“I think we are in different tax brackets”). Even for skeptical viewers, it’s an irresistible watch, tickling the ASMR corners of the brain. But unlike viral ASMR videos of wooden balls clacking in soup bowls or the supple crunch of Kinetic Sand, this one replays something every viewer is already familiar with: the sound of ice clattering in a freezer.
“It’s a fascinating thing that’s part of our daily life,” said Leslie Kirchhoff, the founder of Disco Cubes, a 4-year-old custom ice company in Los Angeles. “And you can make it as exciting or as normal as you want.”
For Kirchhoff, ice presented itself as an untapped market for creativity. “Baby me had always wanted to be an inventor,” she said, “and that came rushing back when I realized nobody was doing anything cool with ice.” Under the Disco Cubes banner, she creates custom ice for brand-sponsored events and private parties.
After learning English’s method for making clear ice, Kirchhoff developed her own way of suspending objects — mostly flowers, produce and die-cut logos — in ice, a “pretty intense” procedure, she said, that “takes three very specifically timed steps over three days.” She closely guards her process, and charges a steep price: “The lowest we’ll go for floral spheres is $8 per sphere,” she said.

Rees, the historian, thinks there’s something distinctly American about splurging on ice. “We’re willing to spend on something that’s essentially free — that’s a sign that we value it.”
These Are Boom Times for Specialty Ice. Here’s How to Use Each Shape.
In homes and bars and on social media, ice is no longer a square-cut, predictable bit player. Today there are dozens of molds and machines that can create a different style of ice for every occasion. Here’s a quick look at the most popular shapes and the best ways to use them.
— Ice Sticks
These thin sticks are great for plopping into insulated water bottles with narrow openings, thus their nickname: water-bottle ice. The molds come both uncovered and covered (to prevent spills) and range from steak fry-size to hot dog-size. Freeze cucumbers or lemon rinds in them to spruce up your hydration.
— Ice Cubes
These are not like the cubes created by your standard freezer tray. They’re much larger, roughly the size of ring boxes, and can be made in silicone molds. You can use these cubes — which are slower to melt — for all kinds of drinks, to suspend pieces of fruit, herbs or citrus rinds, or to freeze coffee and smoothies.
— Ice Balls
These small, marble-size bits — which sit somewhere between crushed ice and pebble (or nugget) ice — can be made in molds, without a pricey refrigerator. Use them to rapidly cool down drinks or make cocktails like cobblers and juleps.
— Ice Spheres
First popularized in high-end cocktail bars, large ice spheres are great for keeping a drink cold, especially those of the alcoholic variety, without watering them down too quickly. With the rise of silicone molds, these larger ices now come in interesting shapes like roses and bulldogs.
— Ice Shapes
As with ice spheres, there are now hundreds of unique ice molds for sale online that go beyond the simple cube: butterflies, cactuses, skulls, stars, hexagons and more. Use these molds for your next themed gathering, holiday party or just because it makes you happy. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Ricou Browning, 93; Raised Goose Bumps as the Gill Man: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He helped bring "Flipper" to the movies and TV but was best known for his plunge in a monster suit in "Creature From the Black Lagoon."
Ricou Browning, who played the title character, or at least the underwater version of it, in one of the most enduring creature features of the 1950s, "Creature From the Black Lagoon," died on Feb. 27 at his home in Southwest Ranches, Fla., northwest of Miami. He was 93.
His daughter Renee Le Feuvre confirmed the death.
Mr. Browning was 23 when Newt Perry, a promoter of various Florida attractions for whom he had worked as a teenager, asked him to show some Hollywood visitors around Wakulla Springs, a picturesque spot near Tallahassee. The entourage -- which, as Mr. Browning told the story later, included Jack Arnold, the film's director, and the cameraman Scotty Welbourne -- was scouting locations for a planned movie about an underwater monster.
"Scotty had his underwater camera," Mr. Browning recalled in an interview recorded in "The Creature Chronicles: Exploring the Black Lagoon Trilogy," a 2014 book by Tom Weaver (with David Schecter and Steve Kronenberg), "and he asked me if I would get in the water with him and swim in front of the camera so they could get some perspective."
Mr. Arnold not only liked the location; he also liked Mr. Browning. He called him days later and asked if he would want to play the creature for the underwater scenes to be shot in Florida. (An actor named Ben Chapman portrayed the monster in the scenes on land, which were filmed in California.)
"We've tested a lot of people for this part," Mr. Browning recalled Mr. Arnold telling him, "but I'd like to have you play the creature -- I like your swimming."
In August 1953 he was brought to California to be fitted for the suit that would turn him into the Gill Man, and six months later "Creature From the Black Lagoon" was released. It was the latest in a tradition of monster movies from Universal Studios that included "The Mummy" (1932) and "The Wolf Man" (1941), and it took its place in monster movie lore.
In the film, which was released in 3-D, scientists working in the Amazon discover a creature in a lagoon that takes a shine to a female member of the party, Kay (played by Julie Adams). About 28 minutes into the film, Kay decides to go for a swim in the lagoon, and the creature, still undiscovered by the research party, swims beneath her like an underwater stalker, a scene both creepy and oddly poignant.
"This scene turned it from a regular old monster movie to a 'Beauty and the Beast' thing," Mr. Weaver said by email, "a big reason for the movie's ongoing popularity."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Some critics weren't impressed by the movie.
"The proceedings above and under water were filmed in 3-D to impart an illusion of depth when viewed through polarized glasses," A.H. Weiler wrote in The New York Times. "This adventure has no depth."
Yet the movie did decently at the box office and became a sort of cultural reference point. Mr. Browning, who had the ability to hold his breath underwater for minutes at a time, played the swimming version of the creature in two sequels, "Revenge of the Creature" (1955) and "The Creature Walks Among Us" (1956).
He went on to share a story-writing credit on the 1963 film "Flipper," about a boy who becomes friends with a dolphin, and then, the next year, was a creator of the television series of the same name and directed and helped write a number of its episodes during its three seasons. He also did some of the underwater stunt work.
In an introductory essay in Mr. Weaver's book, Ms. Adams, whose "Black Lagoon" character was played by Ginger Stanley in the underwater scenes, recalled waiting eagerly in California to see the "dailies" -- footage from the day's shooting -- coming out of Florida.
"The dailies were long, silent takes of him and Ginger Stanley deep in the crystal clear water of Wakulla Springs," she wrote. "They'd swim for a while, get some air from an air hose, and then go back and resume their action. It was so exciting to see the Gill Man brought to life by Ricou's unique swimming style, and I was captivated."
Ms. Stanley, Mr. Browning's underwater partner in that eerie scene that helped define the film, died in January in Orlando, Fla., at 91.
Ricou Ren Browning was born on Feb. 16, 1930, in Fort Pierce, Fla. His father, Clement, worked construction in the Navy, and his mother, Inez (Ricou) Browning, was a bookkeeper.
He first saw Wakulla Springs as a teenager and earned some money by swimming deep in the water for the benefit of tourists in glass-bottomed boats, who would watch him plunge to depths of 80 feet and leave tips.
"Some of us kids would earn 30, 40 dollars a day," he told Mr. Weaver for his book, "and that was big, big money."
In the 1940s he also got his first taste of the movie business, appearing in several short films made in the area by Grantland Rice, who was better known as a sportswriter. In one, according to Mr. Weaver's book, Mr. Browning is among the teenagers packed into a Model T Ford that drives into the waters of Wakulla Springs.
After serving in the Air Force from 1947 to 1950, Mr. Browning returned to Florida. He was the underwater double for Forrest Tucker in "Crosswinds" (1951), an adventure story about an effort to recover gold from a sunken plane, which was filmed in Florida. He was performing in Mr. Perry's underwater shows at Weeki Wachee, another Florida attraction, and studying physical education at Florida State University when he was recruited for "Creature From the Black Lagoon."
In his book, Mr. Weaver recounts the hit-or-miss process of coming up with the right creature costume, and the difficulties Mr. Browning had to deal with once the right look was found. One problem was that the costume was made of foam rubber, which floats.
"I wore a chest plate that was thin lead," Mr. Browning told him, as well as thigh and ankle weights.
Another problem, Mr. Weaver said, was that Mr. Chapman, the actor playing the on-land version of the creature, was quite tall; in Florida, Mr. Browning had scenes with Ms. Stanley and several other stand-ins.
"Ricou was average height," Mr. Weaver said, "so short people were hired to play the hero-heroine-bad guy so that Ricou would look comparatively king-sized."
Mr. Browning's later film work included directing the comedy "Salty" (1973), about a sea lion, and the crime drama "Mr. No Legs" (1978), about a mob enforcer who is a double amputee, as well as doing stunt work in several movies, including serving as Jerry Lewis's underwater double in the 1959 comedy "Don't Give Up the Ship."
Mr. Browning's first marriage, to Margaret Kelly in 1951, ended in divorce. His second wife, Fran Ravelo, whom he married in 1977, died in 2020. In addition to his daughter Renee, he is survived by three other children from his first marriage, his sons, Kelly and Ricou Jr., and his daughter Kim Browning; 10 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
Mr. Weaver noted that all of the other actors who portrayed monsters in the classic Universal films died some time ago.
"Ricou," he said, "had the distinction of being the last man standing."

Ricou Browning, who played the title character, or at least the underwater version of it, in one of the most enduring creature features of the 1950s, “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” died Feb. 27 at his home in Southwest Ranches, Florida, northwest of Miami. He was 93.
His daughter Renee Le Feuvre confirmed the death.
Browning was 23 when Newt Perry, a promoter of various Florida attractions for whom he had worked as a teenager, asked him to show some Hollywood visitors around Wakulla Springs, a picturesque spot near Tallahassee. The entourage — which, as Browning told the story later, included Jack Arnold, the film’s director, and cameraman Scotty Welbourne — was scouting locations for a planned movie about an underwater monster.
“Scotty had his underwater camera,” Browning recalled in an interview recorded in “The Creature Chronicles: Exploring the Black Lagoon Trilogy,” a 2014 book by Tom Weaver (with David Schecter and Steve Kronenberg), “and he asked me if I would get in the water with him and swim in front of the camera so they could get some perspective.”
Arnold not only liked the location; he also liked Browning. He called him days later and asked if he would want to play the creature for the underwater scenes to be shot in Florida. (An actor named Ben Chapman portrayed the monster in the scenes on land, which were filmed in California.)
“We’ve tested a lot of people for this part,” Browning recalled Arnold telling him, “but I’d like to have you play the creature — I like your swimming.”
In August 1953 he was brought to California to be fitted for the suit that would turn him into the Gill Man, and six months later “Creature From the Black Lagoon” was released. It was the latest in a tradition of monster movies from Universal Studios that included “The Mummy” (1932) and “The Wolf Man” (1941), and it took its place in monster movie lore.
In the film, which was released in 3D, scientists working in the Amazon discover a creature in a lagoon that takes a shine to a female member of the party, Kay (played by Julie Adams). About 28 minutes into the film, Kay decides to go for a swim in the lagoon, and the creature, still undiscovered by the research party, swims beneath her like an underwater stalker, a scene both creepy and oddly poignant.
“This scene turned it from a regular old monster movie to a ‘Beauty and the Beast’ thing,” Weaver said by email, “a big reason for the movie’s ongoing popularity.”
Some critics weren’t impressed by the movie.
“The proceedings above and under water were filmed in 3-D to impart an illusion of depth when viewed through polarized glasses,” A.H. Weiler wrote in The New York Times. “This adventure has no depth.”
Yet the movie did decently at the box office and became a sort of cultural reference point. Browning, who had the ability to hold his breath underwater for minutes at a time, played the swimming version of the creature in two sequels, “Revenge of the Creature” (1955) and “The Creature Walks Among Us” (1956).
He went on to share a story-writing credit on the 1963 film “Flipper,” about a boy who becomes friends with a dolphin, and then, the next year, was a creator of the television series of the same name and directed and helped write a number of its episodes during its three seasons. He also did some of the underwater stunt work.
In an introductory essay in Weaver’s book, Adams, whose “Black Lagoon” character was played by Ginger Stanley in the underwater scenes, recalled waiting eagerly in California to see the “dailies” — footage from the day’s shooting — coming out of Florida.
“The dailies were long, silent takes of him and Ginger Stanley deep in the crystal clear water of Wakulla Springs,” she wrote. “They’d swim for a while, get some air from an air hose, and then go back and resume their action. It was so exciting to see the Gill Man brought to life by Ricou’s unique swimming style, and I was captivated.”
Stanley, Browning’s underwater partner in that eerie scene that helped define the film, died in January in Orlando, Florida, at 91.
Ricou Ren Browning was born Feb. 16, 1930, in Fort Pierce, Florida. His father, Clement, worked construction in the Navy, and his mother, Inez (Ricou) Browning, was a bookkeeper.

The Mona Lisa Predicted The Brillo Box: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Any day now, the Supreme Court will hand down a decision that could change the future of Western art -- and, in a sense, its history, too. Blame the appeals court judgment from 2021 declaring that Andy Warhol had no right to appropriate someone else's photo of Prince into one of the Pop artist's classic silk-screened portraits.
The art world quailed at the ruling.
"It strikes at the heart of the way artists today have been raised to make and understand art," the Brooklyn Museum opined in a brief to the Supreme Court, which is now reconsidering the appeals court's conclusion about copyright law.
Artists piled on with a brief slamming the appeals court for "denigrating art that borrows, appropriates and replicates prior works as something akin to plagiarism or exploitation."
In its own brief, the Andy Warhol Foundation, whose fight with the photographer Lynn Goldsmith got the case started, quoted a certain Blake Gopnik, writing in this newspaper: "The act of 'retaining the essential elements' of an extant image is Warhol's entire m.o. as one of the most important of all modern artists." I had gone further: "There's a lot that judges can do with the stroke of a pen, but rewriting art history isn't one of them. They're stuck with appropriation as one of the great artistic innovations of the modern era."
We art-worlders were right to jump to the defense of appropriation art. Today's culture would clearly be poorer without Warhol's Campbell Soups, Brillo Boxes and Flowers, inspiring us for six decades now.
But what if those pleas to the justices were too modest?
Maybe Warhol's right to use Goldsmith's photo wasn't actually about anything that happened in the past century.
Maybe his appropriations matter so much because they get at the heart and meaning and origins of the entire tradition of Western art. They may have so much power now because they point us back to a moment, during the Renaissance, when a series of appropriations completely transformed the function of European paintings and sculptures, turning them into the kinds of museum-worthy objects we contemplate today.
People had been crafting gorgeous, powerful objects for millenniums. But those usually had relatively evident functions: to call down the favor of a god, or to assert a noble pedigree, or to show off a new wife. What seems to happen around 1500 is that certain fancy Europeans start to imagine they can take those functional objects -- sacred paintings, family portraits -- and appropriate them, unchanged, into a new domain that looks more like the art of today, where images aren't expected to have any fixed function at all, except to trigger wonder and puzzlement and, especially, endless talk.
For a half-decade, I've been puzzling through art's functionless function with Alva Noë, who chairs the philosophy department at the University of California, Berkeley. His forthcoming book, "The Entanglement," digs into the difference between the pictures and objects humans use every day, to shop on Amazon.com or to call on their gods, and the pictures and objects we use as works of art.
"Sure, that's my grandma from the photo album," Noë explained in our most recent conversation. "But if you take it out of the context of the photo album and put it on a wall in a gallery, what the heck is it anymore? It's no longer clear what it is, what it is trying to show or what it is for -- what it is a tool for doing."
And that's the point. Once that photo is in a gallery -- once it has been appropriated from family life into the world of art -- "it is going to tempt you and invite you to look harder, look longer, ask questions, interrogate, try to make something of it," Noë said. And that, according to Noë, helps us rethink our lives beyond art.
That opening up of new possibilities, while refusing any final conclusions, is what makes art so powerful.
So maybe we actually use the word "art" to mean two different things, the way "bat" can name a flying animal or a stick for hitting balls. We use "art" to talk about almost any kind of notably attractive object. And then we use those same three letters to point to the tiny subset of objects that get the wildly peculiar kind of attention museums are meant to foster.
The term "Fine Art" has often been used to separate out that second meaning, but I hate how that "fine," and those capital letters, implies some kind of superiority. A picture we are using to document a war crime may actually deserve more respect than one of those self-portraits by Cindy Sherman that gets us endlessly talking and thinking. So lately I've been collapsing "Fine Art" into the new term "fArt," so that we art lovers -- fArt lovers -- know not to take ourselves too seriously.
We can get insight into that first transformation of art into fArt, circa 1500, from the research of Alexander Nagel, an art historian at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. It looks as though a few religious reformers -- in particular Girolamo Savonarola, the Florentine firebrand -- began to be disgusted by the distracting realism of certain new sacred paintings, like the ones that scored artistic points by posing local girls as biblical heroines: "The figures you have made in the churches are in the likeness of one or another woman, which is very badly done and in great disregard for what is God's," Savonarola raged.
The issue, as Nagel spelled it out in his book "The Controversy of Renaissance Art," was that the paintings' viewers, instead of having their minds on God and his saints, were engaging in "the pleasurable activity of pictorial analysis" -- the kind of contemplative work that Noë finds in what we're calling fArt.
Some of Savonarola's contemporaries solved the problem. Franz von Sickingen, a patron of Martin Luther himself, suggested that those distracting church paintings should be moved into secular settings -- as "ornaments of fine rooms," he said, where their "art, beauty, and magnificence" could be safely studied and enjoyed. That is, those newfangled religious objects should be appropriated into the domain of fArt, to receive the kind of attention we give them today when they're hung down the hall from the Warhols. (Of course, other versions of fArt have cropped up at other moments in other places -- in Persia, or China, or Japan -- but they didn't play a role in the Leonardo-to-Warhol story.)
In the early 16th century, all sorts of objects whose functions might once have been clear start migrating -- start being appropriated -- into such rooms. You see religious paintings being gathered into art collections where they can't have had any ritual use. The Mona Lisa itself never gets delivered to the patron who paid to have his wife commemorated in it; instead Leonardo da Vinci carries the painting with him as he travels, reworking it as an example of his fArt. After Leonardo's death, in France in 1519, the painting is treasured by King Francis I and his heirs, none of whom cared about the woman it showed or the pride of the man who married her.
Around that same time, paintings start being created that are so hard to figure out, they could only ever function as fArt. A picture by the Venetian artist Giorgione is referred to as "The Three Philosophers," but the title is that vague only because we have never been able to settle on what the artist had in mind for his three figures.
Nagel believes that Giorgione had such unsettled meaning as his goal, and he tracks how the artist actually worked to make his subject less legible, abandoning the standard religious imagery of the magi at the manger by leaving a blank space where you'd expect Christ and his mother, turning the three kings into the "philosophers" of our new title. "The target of the inquiry is missing: We don't know what the target is; they don't know what the target is," Nagel explained. "They're just there."
It's not that subjects and meaning stop mattering in the unstable fArtworks of Giorgione and his ilk, getting replaced by so-called aesthetic values such as "beauty" or "form." Quite the opposite: Meaning stops being a given and becomes the object of a compelling quest, as it is today when we puzzle out a picture of a soup can.
Once fArt began to be created for its own sake, from scratch, appropriation went mostly to sleep for another 500 years. It finally came back into play in Europe early last century, when modern artists wanted to shake up a stale fArt world by injecting it, once again, with energies appropriated from outside.
Masks and statuettes and other ritual objects grabbed from Africa and beyond got pulled into museums where they could appeal to the peculiar taste of Western colonizers for thinking and talking about looking. In Africa, "when the mask wasn't being danced, it was wrapped up usually and stored away; it wasn't hung up to be admired and appreciated," explained Larry Shiner, emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois. His influential book "The Invention of Art" dwells on the issues of power -- even sometimes of violence and theft -- that have always vexed Western fArt and its appropriations.
If cultural influences have always run back and forth between peoples, full-blown cultural appropriation may have a special history in Europe. Once the Renaissance built its new "art system," as Nagel calls it, around appropriation, Europeans felt free to recast the functions of objects from foreign cultures, regardless of what those might have meant for their creators. "That art system constantly needs to be fueled, even from its beginnings, by what is outside of it," Nagel said. "That is the way it works."
As Shiner has pointed out, sometimes that means asking the West's own everyday objects to serve the functionless functions of fArt.
Early on, art museum curators began collecting photos commissioned for geological surveys so that, Shiner said, they could be "taken out of their function as showing you what something looked like -- for purposes of geology, exploration, camping or whatever it might be -- and treated purely as images to be enjoyed and appreciated."
In 1942, Alfred Barr, founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, may have taken appropriation too far for his own good. After he presented an ornate shoeshine stand as sculpture, his board of directors demoted him to curator.
Today's art world doesn't hesitate to rely on appropriation to energize newer movements like relational aesthetics, where Rirkrit Tiravanija's curry parties invite contemplation as fArt, or investigative aesthetics, where the political fact-finding of Laura Poitras gets welcomed into an art museum.
This crazy variety is possible because when we talk about fArt we're not talking about some particular kind of object, but about something we do to an object. It's more of a verb than a noun: We fArt the things we want to ponder. And that's true even of the fanciest of paintings and sculptures, which can spend most of their lives playing pedestrian functions -- as investments, or tourist attractions, or over-the-sofa décor -- except for the moments we give them a special kind of museum attention.
That's what Warhol first made clear, in 1964, with "sculptures" that were pretty much indistinguishable from the everyday cartons used to ship Brillo pads -- except that Warhol's boxes were meant to do all their work in what Noë calls "a space of thought and talk, a space of criticism." (Marcel Duchamp had made a similar move in 1917, with the urinal he presented as sculpture, but that was less appropriation than detonation, meant to destroy art rather than give it new life.)
Maybe the productive instability that's at the center of Western fArt is there because we recognize that every painting or sculpture we're using for contemplative, talky purposes might just possibly have been put to more practical use. It's that split personality -- Brillo box or sculpture called "Brillo Box"; sacred icon or landmark painting; investment or museum piece -- that gives fArt its charge.
That doubled identity is on view in the Prince portrait silk-screened by Warhol, since it never conceals its source in Goldsmith's photo of Prince. Those appeals court judges were especially bothered at finding that Warhol's appropriation left both Princes in sight at once. They should have realized that the fArt in question gave us Prince, squared.

So lately I’ve been collapsing “Fine Art” into the new term “fArt,” so that we art lovers — fArt lovers — know not to take ourselves too seriously.
We can get insight into that first transformation of art into fArt, circa 1500, from the research of Alexander Nagel, an art historian at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts. It looks as though a few religious reformers — in particular Girolamo Savonarola, the Florentine firebrand — began to be disgusted by the distracting realism of certain new sacred paintings, like the ones that scored artistic points by posing local girls as biblical heroines: “The figures you have made in the churches are in the likeness of one or another woman, which is very badly done and in great disregard for what is God’s,” Savonarola raged.
The issue, as Nagel spelled it out in his book “The Controversy of Renaissance Art,” was that the paintings’ viewers, instead of having their minds on God and his saints, were engaging in “the pleasurable activity of pictorial analysis” — the kind of contemplative work that Noë finds in what we’re calling fArt.
Some of Savonarola’s contemporaries solved the problem. Franz von Sickingen, a patron of Martin Luther himself, suggested that those distracting church paintings should be moved into secular settings — as “ornaments of fine rooms,” he said, where their “art, beauty, and magnificence” could be safely studied and enjoyed. That is, those newfangled religious objects should be appropriated into the domain of fArt, to receive the kind of attention we give them today when they’re hung down the hall from the Warhols. (Of course, other versions of fArt have cropped up at other moments in other places — in Persia, or China, or Japan — but they didn’t play a role in the Leonardo-to-Warhol story.)
In the early 16th century, all sorts of objects whose functions might once have been clear start migrating — start being appropriated — into such rooms. You see religious paintings being gathered into art collections where they can’t have had any ritual use. The “Mona Lisa” itself never gets delivered to the patron who paid to have his wife commemorated in it; instead Leonardo da Vinci carries the painting with him as he travels, reworking it as an example of his fArt. After da Vinci’s death in France in 1519, the painting is treasured by King Francis I and his heirs, none of whom cared about the woman it showed or the pride of the man who married her.
Around that same time, paintings start being created that are so hard to figure out, they could only ever function as fArt. A picture by Venetian artist Giorgione is referred to as “The Three Philosophers,” but the title is that vague only because we have never been able to settle on what the artist had in mind for his three figures.
Nagel believes that Giorgione had such unsettled meaning as his goal, and he tracks how the artist actually worked to make his subject less legible, abandoning the standard religious imagery of the magi at the manger by leaving a blank space where you’d expect Christ and his mother, turning the three kings into the “philosophers” of our new title.
“The target of the inquiry is missing: We don’t know what the target is; they don’t know what the target is,” Nagel explained. “They’re just there.”
It’s not that subjects and meaning stop mattering in the unstable fArtworks of Giorgione and his ilk, getting replaced by so-called aesthetic values such as “beauty” or “form.” Quite the opposite: Meaning stops being a given and becomes the object of a compelling quest, as it is today when we puzzle out a picture of a soup can.
Once fArt began to be created for its own sake, from scratch, appropriation went mostly to sleep for another 500 years. It finally came back into play in Europe early last century, when modern artists wanted to shake up a stale fArt world by injecting it, once again, with energies appropriated from outside.
Masks and statuettes and other ritual objects grabbed from Africa and beyond got pulled into museums, where they could appeal to the peculiar taste of Western colonizers for thinking and talking about looking. In Africa, “when the mask wasn’t being danced, it was wrapped up usually and stored away; it wasn’t hung up to be admired and appreciated,” explained Larry Shiner, emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois. His influential book “The Invention of Art” dwells on the issues of power — even sometimes of violence and theft — that have always vexed Western fArt and its appropriations.
If cultural influences have always run back and forth between peoples, full-blown cultural appropriation may have a special history in Europe. Once the Renaissance built its new “art system,” as Nagel calls it, around appropriation, Europeans felt free to recast the functions of objects from foreign cultures, regardless of what those might have meant for their creators.
“That art system constantly needs to be fueled, even from its beginnings, by what is outside of it,” Nagel said. “That is the way it works.”
As Shiner has pointed out, sometimes that means asking the West’s own everyday objects to serve the functionless functions of fArt.
Early on, art museum curators began collecting photos commissioned for geological surveys so that, Shiner said, they could be “taken out of their function as showing you what something looked like — for purposes of geology, exploration, camping or whatever it might be — and treated purely as images to be enjoyed and appreciated.”
In 1942, Alfred Barr, founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, may have taken appropriation too far for his own good. After he presented an ornate shoeshine stand as sculpture, his board of directors demoted him to curator.
Today’s art world doesn’t hesitate to rely on appropriation to energize newer movements like relational aesthetics, where Rirkrit Tiravanija’s curry parties invite contemplation as fArt, or investigative aesthetics, where the political fact-finding of Laura Poitras gets welcomed into an art museum.
This crazy variety is possible because when we talk about fArt we’re not talking about some particular kind of object but about something we do to an object. It’s more of a verb than a noun: We fArt the things we want to ponder. And that’s true even of the fanciest of paintings and sculptures, which can spend most of their lives playing pedestrian functions — as investments, or tourist attractions, or over-the-sofa décor — except for the moments we give them a special kind of museum attention.
That’s what Warhol first made clear, in 1964, with “sculptures” that were pretty much indistinguishable from the everyday cartons used to ship Brillo pads — except that Warhol’s boxes were meant to do all their work in what Noë calls “a space of thought and talk, a space of criticism.” (Marcel Duchamp had made a similar move in 1917, with the urinal he presented as sculpture, but that was less appropriation than detonation, meant to destroy art rather than give it new life.)
Maybe the productive instability that’s at the center of Western fArt is there because we recognize that every painting or sculpture we’re using for contemplative, talky purposes might just possibly have been put to more practical use. It’s that split personality — Brillo box or sculpture called “Brillo Box”; sacred icon or landmark painting; investment or museum piece — that gives fArt its charge.
That doubled identity is on view in the Prince portrait silk-screened by Warhol, since it never conceals its source in Goldsmith’s photo of Prince. Those appeals court judges were especially bothered at finding that Warhol’s appropriation left both Princes in sight at once. They should have realized that the fArt in question gave us Prince, squared. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Hubble Telescope Faces Threat From SpaceX and Other Companies’ Satellites

The Hubble Space Telescope, known for recording awe-inspiring images of the cosmos while advancing the field of astronomy, is under threat.
Private companies are launching thousands of satellites that are photobombing the telescope — producing long bright streaks and curves of light that can be impossible to remove. And the problem is only getting worse.
A study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, reveals an increase in the percentage of images recorded by the Hubble that are spoiled by passing satellites. And the data goes only through 2021. Thousands more satellites have been launched since then by SpaceX and other companies, and many more are expected to go to orbit in the years ahead, affecting the Hubble and potentially other telescopes in space.
“We’re going to be living with this problem. And astronomy will be impacted,” said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the study. “There will be science that can’t be done. There will be science that’s significantly more expensive to do. There will be things that we miss.”
The Hubble Space Telescope’s legacy cannot be overstated. Because of the observatory, we now know, for example, that the universe is 13.8 billion years old, that most galaxies contain a supermassive black hole at their centers and that stars form in violent processes. The Hubble’s images — including the gorgeous clouds of gas and dust in the “pillars of creation” and the view of nearly 10,000 galaxies in the “Hubble ultra deep field” — never fail to inspire.
But the number of satellites in orbit has significantly increased since the Hubble launched in 1990, and now it is staring at the cosmos through a field of satellites.
In May 2019, SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlink satellites, designed to broadcast internet signals across the globe. Soon after, an outcry emerged among astronomers who were concerned that Starlink’s streaks would jeopardize a number of campaigns to observe the universe from telescopes on Earth.
In response, Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, suggested that astronomers bypass the issue by moving telescopes to orbit.
But Hubble, which lives in low-Earth orbit roughly 335 miles above Earth’s surface, actually resides less than 10 miles below most Starlink satellites. That means that the observatory and other orbital space telescopes are still facing interference from satellite constellations. “Not only do you have to put your telescopes in space, but you also have to put them above all the other traffic,” McDowell said.
“I think we’ll be forced to do that in the decades to come,” he said. But that isn’t possible for current telescopes in low-Earth orbit or spacecraft that governments are building and launching in the coming years.
To quantify the effect of satellite constellations on Hubble, Sandor Kruk, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and his colleagues analyzed an archive of images taken from 2002 through 2021.
They had help from hundreds of citizen scientists who pored through images to tag those with clear satellite streaks. That data set was then used as a training set for a machine-learning algorithm that analyzed more than 100,000 individual Hubble photos. Their results show that the chance of seeing a satellite in a Hubble image from 2009 to 2020 is only 3.7%. But the chance of seeing one in 2021 is 5.9% — an increase that they say corresponds to Starlink. By the date of the analysis, 1,562 Starlink satellites were in orbit. Another company, OneWeb, had lofted 320 satellites.
Mark McCaughrean, an astronomer at the European Space Agency and a co-author on the new study, is confident in their analysis but notes that this is only a minor issue at the moment. Typically, Hubble takes multiple images that are stacked on top of one another — a technique that will erase any satellites.
And NASA agrees. “While such analyses may show a gradual increase in detected satellite trails over time, most of these streaks are readily removed using standard data reduction techniques, and the majority of affected images are still usable,” a spokesperson said in regard to the latest study. “Satellite streaks do not currently pose a significant threat to Hubble’s science efficiency and data analysis.”
That threat is higher when the Hubble surveys a large swath of the sky. Then it might take only one or two images before redirecting its camera. If a satellite photobombs one of those images, the image might have to be tossed.
In addition, the satellites could pose a serious threat to a telescope that hasn’t launched yet. At the end of this year, China plans to send Xuntian, also known as the Chinese Survey Space Telescope, into low-Earth orbit. Xuntian will have a larger field of view than Hubble, making it much harder for satellites to slip by undetected.
“It’s going to be very severely affected by these satellites right off the bat,” McDowell said.
And Xuntian can’t simply launch into a higher orbit. China’s plan is for the telescope to share an orbit with the Tiangong space station so that astronauts can refurbish it if necessary.
A spokesperson from SpaceX declined to comment on the new study but pointed toward the company’s past efforts to mitigate the effects of Starlink. The company has tried a variety of methods to darken its satellites, including a mirror film designed to direct light away from the ground. But Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist at Queen’s University Belfast who was not involved in the study, worries that the light will be directed up instead and could potentially worsen the situation for space-based telescopes.
There are simply too many unknowns at the moment, including the ultimate number of satellites.
SpaceX hopes to eventually expand the size of its fleet to 42,000 Starlink satellites. Many other companies are in the market, too: Amazon, the British satellite provider OneWeb, a Chinese company called Galaxy Space, and even governments. A combined 431,713 satellites are planned to launch in the coming years.
“It’s a bit of a feeding frenzy at the moment,” McCaughrean said.
That estimate is based on filings with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the International Telecommunication Union. But even if only 100,000 satellites launched, that would increase the number of satellites in orbit by a factor of 10 since the new study took place — meaning that roughly 50% of Hubble’s images would spot a satellite. And if every other image had a satellite streak, the researchers worry about how much usable science could be gathered.
“When will Hubble not be useful anymore?” McCaughrean asked. “That might be 10 or 20 years away, but it’s not inconceivable that there’s a point at which you say, ‘Let’s not bother anymore.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Any day now, the Supreme Court will hand down a decision that could change the future of Western art — and, in a sense, its history, too. Blame the appeals court judgment from 2021 declaring that Andy Warhol had no right to appropriate someone else’s photo of Prince into one of the pop artist’s classic silk-screened portraits.
The art world quailed at the ruling.
“It strikes at the heart of the way artists today have been raised to make and understand art,” the Brooklyn Museum opined in a brief to the Supreme Court, which is now reconsidering the appeals court’s conclusion about copyright law.
Artists piled on with a brief slamming the appeals court for “denigrating art that borrows, appropriates and replicates prior works as something akin to plagiarism or exploitation.”
In its own brief, the Andy Warhol Foundation, whose fight with photographer Lynn Goldsmith got the case started, quoted a certain Blake Gopnik, writing in this newspaper: “The act of ‘retaining the essential elements’ of an extant image is Warhol’s entire M.O. as one of the most important of all modern artists.” I had gone further: “There’s a lot that judges can do with the stroke of a pen, but rewriting art history isn’t one of them. They’re stuck with appropriation as one of the great artistic innovations of the modern era.”
We art-worlders were right to jump to the defense of appropriation art. Today’s culture would clearly be poorer without Warhol’s Campbell Soups, Brillo Boxes and Flowers, inspiring us for six decades now.
But what if those pleas to the justices were too modest?
Maybe Warhol’s right to use Goldsmith’s photo wasn’t actually about anything that happened in the past century.
Maybe his appropriations matter so much because they get at the heart and meaning and origins of the entire tradition of Western art. They may have so much power now because they point us back to a moment during the Renaissance when a series of appropriations completely transformed the function of European paintings and sculptures, turning them into the kinds of museum-worthy objects we contemplate today.
People had been crafting gorgeous, powerful objects for millenniums. But those usually had relatively evident functions: to call down the favor of a god, assert a noble pedigree or show off a new wife. What seems to happen around 1500 is that certain fancy Europeans start to imagine they can take those functional objects — sacred paintings, family portraits — and appropriate them, unchanged, into a new domain that looks more like the art of today, where images aren’t expected to have any fixed function at all except to trigger wonder and puzzlement and, especially, endless talk.
For a half-decade I’ve been puzzling through art’s functionless function with Alva Noë, who chairs the philosophy department at the University of California, Berkeley. His forthcoming book, “The Entanglement,” digs into the difference between the pictures and objects humans use every day, to shop on Amazon.com or to call on their gods, and the pictures and objects we use as works of art.
“Sure, that’s my grandma from the photo album,” Noë explained in our most recent conversation. “But if you take it out of the context of the photo album and put it on a wall in a gallery, what the heck is it anymore? It’s no longer clear what it is, what it is trying to show or what it is for — what it is a tool for doing.”
And that’s the point. Once that photo is in a gallery — once it has been appropriated from family life into the world of art — “it is going to tempt you and invite you to look harder, look longer, ask questions, interrogate, try to make something of it,” Noë said. And that, according to Noë, helps us rethink our lives beyond art.
That opening up of new possibilities, while refusing any final conclusions, is what makes art so powerful.
So maybe we actually use the word “art” to mean two different things, the way “bat” can name a flying animal or a stick for hitting balls. We use “art” to talk about almost any kind of notably attractive object. And then we use those same three letters to point to the tiny subset of objects that get the wildly peculiar kind of attention museums are meant to foster.
The term “Fine Art” has often been used to separate out that second meaning, but I hate how that “fine,” and those capital letters, implies some kind of superiority. A picture we are using to document a war crime may actually deserve more respect than one of those self-portraits by Cindy Sherman that gets us endlessly talking and thinking. So lately I’ve been collapsing “Fine Art” into the new term “fArt,” so that we art lovers — fArt lovers — know not to take ourselves too seriously.

Full text: The place: a modest house at the end of a narrow street in Culver City, Calif. The problem: The house's owner had been feeding bread to a population of rats, which had moved into her kitchen and living room and then into the ceilings, where they had begun encroaching on the neighboring tenants from above. The diagnosis: "Unbelievable," said Dave Schuelke, a buff and ruddy-faced exterminator who is one-half of the pest control and home repair company Twin Home Experts. "I've never seen this before."
Mr. Schuelke was speaking breathlessly to a camera that he had trained on himself. He was alone behind the house, but his intended audience was the nearly 250,000 subscribers of the Twin Home Experts YouTube channel, where he and his identical twin brother, Jim, post videos of themselves on the job. Nine years ago they began uploading videos about general home repair, with titles like "How to Unclog a Toilet Without a Plunger" and "How to Find a Sewer Odor," but, more than 70 million views later, their content has skewed toward rats. "Attic Rats! We Smoked Them Out" is one recent title. Also, "Destroying Fat Rats in Washington, D.C." And "Rat Trapping in Mexico City, We Baited With Churros."
"People want to see that type of gory-looking stuff," Dave Schuelke said, setting down the camera. "People want to see the action."
View counts are directly related to whether a video's thumbnail shows some sort of tool -- a screwdriver, or a Sawzall, or a bulked-up trap -- pointing at a rat. The thumbnail of the Schuelkes' most popular video, with over five million views, features an airsoft gun pointed at a rat nest.
Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, that ignominious ratropolis, has also been playing on this morbid fascination with the midsize rodents. Since the beginning of his term in 2022, Mayor Adams has been vocal about his fear and hatred of rats and about his drive to kill them. In November, his office posted a job listing for a rat czar; whoever took the job, the listing noted, had to be "somewhat bloodthirsty." Deployed as a lighthearted rallying point amid other, more charged policies, the anti-rat agenda has been covered extensively by media outlets. "We're making it clear that rats do not run this city," Mayor Adams said in a news conference last year.
Reasons for controlling the urban rat population are abundant: The animals can spread diseases to humans, destroy property and damage native ecosystems. But rats are also cognitively advanced social animals, and questions about how to effectively control them can raise tricky ethical questions. Glue traps will leave rats starving, for days, before dying. Poison leads to a slow, painful death and can endanger other wildlife. Standard wooden snap traps often catch limbs or tails, forcing rats to gnaw them off in desperation. Live-catch traps are difficult to implement, and when many rats are stuck in the same place together without food, they sometimes eat one another.
Even if rats are extracted from an urban environment, what do you do with them? Release them into the woods, where they can damage existing ecosystems? Keep them as pets? Rats are reviled but resilient, dangerous but inculpable. "Right away, you end up in a very uncomfortable position," said Robert Corrigan, a New York City rodentologist who has studied urban rats for decades. "There's no way to get out."
Where the Wild Rat Traps Are
The Schuelke brothers, along with a handful of employees, had been moving around the house in Culver City for about three hours, looking for rat nests and openings through which the animals could squeeze. The twins' strategy was to close off every rat entry and exit point and lay traps around the house as the animals grew hungrier and more desperate.
But the whole place was compromised. Holes in the roof, the walls, the floors. The house's owner, an 82-year-old woman named Ann Chung, said that she could hear rats underneath her at night. She expressed a kind of fondness for the animals -- she was feeding them twice a day -- and mentioned that, in some countries, there are temples dedicated to rats. (For instance, the Karni Mata Temple in India.) But they were now shredding her collections of newspapers, books and clothes and staining her carpets twice over with urine and grease. "I am defeated in life, in everything now, because of these rats," Ms. Chung said.
There are more than 4,400 mousetrap patents in the United States, but it is difficult to find designs specifically for catching rats -- most are just bigger mousetraps. Rat infestations are also often more of an industrial undertaking than mouse infestations are, less of a do-it-yourself project and more of a job for professional exterminators, who are better at reusing traps. Partly because of this, Woodstream, the country's largest rat and mousetrap manufacturer, sells some 60 million mousetraps a year and nine million rat traps, according to Miguel Nistal, the company's president and chief executive. Most of these are the classic wooden spring-loaded snap trap, which Woodstream sells under the brand name Victor.
Mr. Nistal said that the main complaint he gets about his rat traps is simply that they don't kill rats. Mice are relatively uncomplicated pests; they go for whatever food source is available and, because they're small, are easy to dispatch. But Mr. Nistal said that, according to his company's research, only about 65 percent of the rats that trigger snap traps die. They will wriggle free or outsmart the trap, swiping the bait out safely. Rats are also wary of new things, like traps. "When you and I are gone, and there's nothing else on earth, there will be roaches and rats," Mr. Nistal said.
Shawn Woods, a YouTuber who reviews mouse and rat traps, said that he often has to leave his rat traps out for a couple of days without setting them so the animals feel safe grabbing the food. Mr. Woods tests a trap every week and has a collection of thousands of rodent traps at his home in Oregon. He began making review videos about six years ago, when his channel had only a handful of subscribers and was focused on primitive survival skills. Then, a video demonstrating an ancient deadfall trap received over a million views.
Since then, Mr. Woods has become an influencer in the trapping world, with over 1.7 million subscribers to his channel. New products that he gives positive reviews often sell out on Amazon, and he has met with management at trap manufacturing and design companies, including Woodstream, to share his expertise. Most of the people who reach out to him are amateur inventors who came up with something innovative, like a rat trip wire. "But even if they do have a good idea, actually bringing that to market in a scale where that's profitable, that's really difficult," Mr. Woods said.
Mr. Nistal said that he keeps track of "consumer pain points" to help guide further development. Efficacy is one, but other considerations include reusability, keeping the dead animals out of sight, and remote notification that a trap has been activated. To address these needs, Woodstream has developed dozens of traps that fall into three basic categories: glue traps, spring traps and electric traps. Most of the company's sales, though, come from the classic Victor spring snap trap, which was invented in 1897.
That was one of the traps that the Schuelke twins set up in Ms. Chung's house in Culver City at the end of their first day on the job. The trap was loaded with chunky peanut butter and modified slightly, with a razor blade glued to its edge, to make it, as Dave put it, "the deadliest trap ever." The other trap was what the Schuelkes called the Twin Ratvac, a vacuum modified to turn on when triggered by the presence of a rat, which would then get sucked into a bucket. Wi-Fi cameras were set up to catch the action. A gust of wind rustled tarps laid out on the back porch. The next step was to wait.
"You gotta be a hunter," said Jim, a smile sneaking onto his face.
What Makes a Rat a Rat
The primary species of rat in both New York and Los Angeles is Rattus norvegicus, the brown rat: a midsize rodent that has a whiplike tail and is resilient, intuitive and remarkably fecund. (One study found that female brown rats in a Brazilian favela produced 79 viable offspring a year on average.) Brown rats live in colonies and establish networks of tunnels in which they play, groom one another and touch noses in acts of recognition. They also have a large collection of facial expressions and can sense the emotions of others in their colony. Perhaps in part because of this, brown rats have been found to consistently prefer rewards that benefit others, as opposed to just themselves. They can also learn how to drive tiny cars. And dance to Lady Gaga.
Much research on rat cognition has focused on lab rats, which are bred for experimentation. But Michael Parsons, an urban ecologist at Fordham University who has spent two decades studying city rats, said that wild brown rats (as well as the smaller and rarer black rats) are even more advanced than their laboratory counterparts. "They have unique personalities, and they experience regret, remorse and social justice," Dr. Parsons said.
Dr. Corrigan, who has lived and slept in barns full of rats to better understand them, concurred: "They're intelligent animals, they make decisions, they regret when they make decisions, they're altruistic -- everything we have going, they have going."
It can be difficult for scientists like Dr. Parsons and Dr. Corrigan to secure funding for research on wild rats, and even more difficult to attract new researchers. "I think there are fewer than a dozen research teams worldwide that study urban rats," Dr. Parsons said. This is partly because rats are dangerous -- they carry diseases like bubonic plague -- and are most populous in environments that most humans don't enjoy. Brown rats are also known as sewer rats, and can survive on almost any kind of food: fruit, grain, worms, trash, feces, carcasses. Much of Dr. Parsons's research in New York is carried out in waste management facilities in the dead of night.
The argument for researching wild rats often amounts to something like "know thy enemy." Rats cause an estimated $ 20 billion in damage annually in the United States alone, gnawing through electrical wires and burrowing into the walls of buildings; they also feast on crops. Jason Munshi-South, a biologist and rat researcher at Fordham University, has written about the evolutionary differences of brown rats worldwide, as well as the genetic variation among rats living in uptown and downtown New York City. Because rats reproduce so prolifically, the invisible hand of natural selection becomes more noticeable. Most city rats have developed immunity to first-generation anticoagulants, rendering many poisons useless.
But much less science has been focused on wild rats as rats, rather than as pests. For Dr. Parsons and Dr. Munshi-South, this is a manifestation of society's bias against the animals. Rats fall into the "special category of things we don't want to exist," said Dr. Munshi-South. It's a self-perpetuating intolerance: The less we know about the animals, the easier it is to hate them, and the easier it is to kill them. "In a way, they are the enemy," Dr. Parsons said. "But it doesn't mean we can't have a heart for them."
Humans vs. Rats vs. Humans
Rat trappers, and the rat trapping industry, are not unsympathetic to these arguments. Mr. Nistal acknowledged that glue traps are "inhumane," and he said that his company had been phasing them out. But, he added, for particularly dangerous infestations (for instance, hundreds of rats under a hospital), glue traps are the fastest and most effective method of control.
Mr. Woods often considers whether his popularity on YouTube might have less to do with the practical information he imparts and more to do with the spectacle of dead rats. In his videos, he blurs out the rats' dying moments and often demonstrates traps on stuffed animals, but copycat channels have since popped up that essentially publish rat snuff films. "I have a very fine line to walk, where I'm trying to teach people the best way to control rodents without profiting off of blood and guts and torture," Mr. Woods said.
Some of his videos highlight antique traps, like a 19th-century wooden trap that is shaped like a rat and shoots harpoons from its eyes, or quicksand traps that suffocate rodents. He refuses to feature glue traps and spring traps that aren't strong enough to immediately kill the rats, which he believes cause unnecessary suffering. Even drowning traps, he found, are morally ambiguous: Some rats can swim for more than a day before succumbing. His favorite setup is the Victor snap trap, modified with wooden blinders so the rats must enter headfirst. His favorite large-scale trap is called the Uhlik Repeater trap, which can catch dozens of live rats in one night.
Erin Ryan, who works for the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Vancouver, Canada, has spent years studying rodent traps and thinking of ways to implement a citywide control program that minimizes harm. "What I've learned in my research is that humane means something different to everybody," she said. "But there's always a time and place for lethal control when it comes to rodents." It's simply unsafe to catch and release hundreds of rats.
Ms. Ryan advocates a more holistic approach, starting with an understanding of the animals and their interactions with the urban ecosystem. In the wild, rats face painful deaths at the hands of predators and freezing weather. But in cities, rat issues and rat death almost always can be traced back to people. Humans brought brown rats to North America, destroyed the habitat of potential predators and created environments where rats could thrive. Humans maintain systems of trash and waste and often don't clean their homes. "City rats are a species that in some sense humans have created," Dr. Munshi-South said. "They're evolutionary and ecologically linked to us."
On this, nearly all rat researchers agree. "For me, rats are not the enemy," Dr. Parsons said. "People are the enemy."
Dr. Corrigan is often hired for massive, complex infestations and designs programs to help control the rodents. He can end up dealing with hundreds of rats living in the walls of a dormitory or in the basements of buildings. When that happens, he said, it's an "all-out war to eliminate a very real, substantial risk to human health and safety." But in the end he has to kill animals that he has spent his whole career studying. Years ago, Dr. Corrigan started writing about the contradictions of treating rodents humanely, and it was the most difficult thing he had ever tried to put into words. "Can we, as a humanity, be humane to this animal?" he said. "The answer is a very cold, hard no."
Reality Bites
In Culver City, the Schuelke twins caught four rats. One was snapped in a Victor trap in the garage during the night, its neck sliced by the razor blade. Two more were sucked into the Twin Ratvac in the living room. The fourth came as the brothers and two employees were cleaning up the kitchen on the second day of the job. As they moved the refrigerator, a rat jumped out from behind, and one of the employees sucked it up into a bucket with a vacuum.
The four men brought the bucket with the rat outside and opened the top. There was an inch of gray liquid at the bottom. The rat was wet, clawing at the smooth walls around it. One of the employees picked it up by its tail as Dave got a couple of close-up shots with his camera. The day was sunny, and a child was playing on a tire swing next door.
The Schuelkes often get comments on their YouTube videos shaming them for profiting from killing rats. "Which kind of makes sense in a way," Dave said. "But in the same token, there are too many rats and they need to be killed." He noted that he could try to save every rat he found and drive it 30 miles away. But how could he run a business doing that? And what other sorts of environmental damage would that do? "I'm not a believer in saving rats," he said. "I don't have a heart for them. 'Cause they're nasty."
After capturing the rat footage, Dave returned the animal to the bucket. His brother and employees went back to cleaning up the house. Dave stared at the rat and picked up a wooden two-by-four, painted white, that was lying on the ground. He located the rat's head and crushed it with the short end of the beam. "I don't want it to suffer," he said, as he pushed down with all his weight. The rat struggled for a moment, then stopped. "Poor guy," Dave said, and gave the beam one last push for good measure.

Full text: These actors turned playwrights all excavate memories and meaning from their lives in creating these four shows, which arrive in New York in the coming months.
Arinzé Kene
LONDON -- Growing up in the then-modest neighborhood of Hackney here, Arinzé Kene and his four siblings were convinced they were going to be the new Jackson Five.
"We would learn dance moves from music videos and perform them in the living room," said Kene. "It was the beginning of knowing I wanted to be an entertainer."
Kene, 35, was chatting before a rehearsal of "Misty," his almost one-man show (two musicians accompany him) that will arrive at the Shed on March 3. The piece, which mixes spoken word, music, surreal comedy and performance, tells a tale of gentrification, racial tension and male identity. But it also humorously stages the pitfalls a Black actor faces in telling this tale, via disapproving messages from his friends about racial stereotyping.
"Misty," directed by Omar Elerian, is the sixth play Kene's written, while his acting career has encompassed varied roles, including playing Bob Marley in the musical "Get Up Stand Up!" and Biff Loman in Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman." The critics have swooned. "As much bumbling clown as muscular force to be reckoned with, by turns endearing and commanding," Dominic Cavendish wrote of "Misty" in The Daily Telegraph after it transferred to the West End.
Kene, who exudes a combination of energy, focus and charisma, said he was "constantly creating" when growing up, writing songs and putting out mixtapes and an EP. But he began acting only after stumbling on a teenage drama group near his home. He was also a talented sportsman and academically accomplished; his parents, a taxi driver and a nurse, who had emigrated from Nigeria when Kene was 4, hoped he would become a doctor.
He tried to let them down gently. "Even after I got a three-month gig in the Boney M musical, 'Daddy Cool,' they still thought I was going to university," he said.
University didn't happen, but regular acting jobs did, and at 21 he was playing a leading role in Ché Walker's musical "Been So Long" at the Young Vic. That was the moment he began to believe in himself as an actor.
He was also writing, creating his first play, "Estate Walls," during a writer's course at the Royal Court Theater. He spent two subsequent years in a whirlwind of writing and acting while participating in more writing and directing programs.
"Misty" emerged from a 2012 commission from Madani Younis, then the director of London's Bush Theater. (He is now the chief executive producer at the Shed.) For three years, Kene struggled to write, eventually offering to return the commission fee. Younis refused. Kene then "began to scribble" about his experience of moving back to Hackney, now undergoing rampant gentrification. "The music just started happening," he said. "I didn't always know where the story was going, but I suddenly had a wellspring of information because it was my upbringing, my home."
Although Kene's plays have all drawn on his own experience, he hadn't previously appeared in any of them. But after the actor performed the piece (before a small audience of the Bush artistic team, in the theater's kitchen), Elerian persuaded him to take on the role.
"I was self-conscious about it," he said. "Why would anyone care about my experience? But what I learned is that specific is interesting, honesty is interesting. If it's the truth, people may lean forward." ROSLYN SULCAS
Talene Monahon
In Talene Monahon's "Jane Anger," William Shakespeare is portrayed not as an envy-inspiring wordsmith, but as a pompous misogynist struggling with writer's block during a plague. "Every time I go into quarantine, I'm expected to be more prolific and timely than the last time," he whines to his assistant.
Unlike her fictional Bard, Monahon had a most productive pandemic. Besides "Jane Anger," she wrote "The Good John Proctor"; the Bedlam theater company production of the show begins previews March 12 at the Connelly Theater. Billed as a "prequel" to "The Crucible," the play is a reimagining of the events leading up to the Salem Witch Trials, as experienced by four girls who spend much of their time discussing one another's menstrual cycles and mysterious dreams.
It also hints at darker themes. "I'm interested, for the purposes of the play, in childhood and girlhood and how trauma manifests in a society where there is no language for it and only language about the devil and witchcraft," Monahon said over a video call earlier this month.
"The Good John Proctor" shares DNA with Monahon's other plays, which thoroughly emulsify history and fiction to give voice to previously marginal figures or to connect historical events to our moment.
"I think about this quote from Hilary Mantel all the time: 'History is not the past -- it is the method we have evolved of organizing our ignorance of the past,"' she said.
Monahon, 32, who grew up in Belmont, Mass., attended Dartmouth College and now lives in Brooklyn, attributes her interest in history to her Armenian heritage. Family members had lived through the Armenian genocide, and she grew up with an awareness that historically grand narratives have a way of eliding certain events. "From an early age, I was interested in what histories get taught, what doesn't get taught, who teaches history, who controls the narrative," she said.
Writing came relatively late to Monahon. As a child, she performed in musicals at her Unitarian Universalist church, and her professional acting credits have included productions at Roundabout Theater Company ("Bobbie Clearly") and Playwrights Horizons ("Log Cabin"). "Writing was always something I kind of just did for myself," she said.
The chance to do more of it presented itself during the pandemic, when Monahon worked on virtual playlets for the 24 Hour Plays. She likened the experience to going to graduate school for playwriting. "I started figuring things out for myself about structure and form," she said, "and I think that my writing improved."
"The Good John Proctor" began its life as an exercise there. She fleshed it out with research -- reading Stacy Schiff's "The Witches: Suspicion, Betrayal, and Hysteria in 1692 Salem," and traveling to Texas, along with Tavi Gevinson (who stars in the new play), to read through Arthur Miller's papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
Her play joins a few others, like Sarah Ruhl's "Becky Nurse of Salem" and Kimberly Belflower's "John Proctor Is the Villain," that wrestle with the legacy of the trials and of Arthur Miller's canonical play.
During the interview, Monahon stressed that her play is not a takedown of Miller's. "There's so much in 'The Crucible' that I love and there are also things that really frustrate me," she said. "I feel excited to think about these events from a different angle." RHODA FENG
Ryan J. Haddad
In his past shows, the writer and performer Ryan J. Haddad has ingratiated himself with audiences, using jokes to put spectators at ease. In his new one, "Dark Disabled Stories," produced by the Bushwick Starr and which begins performances at the Public Theater on Feb. 28, he takes a different approach.
"I try to make disability funny so that non-disabled people can understand it and open themselves to it and realize that it's not so scary, so dark," Haddad says early in the play. "Not tonight. I don't feel like it."
A one-man show with a difference, "Dark Disabled Stories" recounts Haddad's journey through a world that doesn't always accommodate his disability (cerebral palsy, which requires a walker and leg braces) or the disabilities of others. The stories are his own -- some he experiences as a protagonist, others he simply observes. But he is joined onstage by Dickie Hearts, who performs the same tales in American Sign Language, and Alejandra Ospina, who provides audio description. The theater also offers expanded wheelchair seating, making "Dark Disabled Stories" the rare show that is accessible to all or nearly all.
That's a happy thing. But "Dark Disabled Stories" isn't designed for uplift. It does not supply what Haddad, 31, refers to, with appropriate derision, as "inspiration porn" -- tales of disabled people triumphing in the face of obstacles internal and external. He doesn't believe that hope is what he owes an audience. What he owes them, he feels, is truth.
"We've been starved for stories about us," Haddad said over breakfast in the lobby of the Public Theater. "What I'm telling, what I'm giving is a really honest portrait. And it's a portrait of me."
Nervy and emphatic, Haddad grew up in a Cleveland suburb, the youngest of three boys. His older brothers were star students and star athletes. But Haddad's passion was theater, musical theater in particular.
While a student at Ohio Wesleyan University, he acted in the theater department's plays, but he realized that if he wanted a more robust career, he would have to create work for himself. He debuted his solo show "Hi, Are You Single?" just after college and has written several other pieces, all of them autobiographical.
"Dark Disabled Stories" has some of the provocations of his earlier work. (The first story finds Haddad in a club's restroom, a stranger's hand down his pants.) But he has pushed himself to go deeper. The first time he tried out the piece, he could feel the energy in the room change.
"I knew it was a little relentless," he said. "I also knew I should be able to tell the darker stories, without having you pitying me."
That "you" implies an able-bodied spectator, but "Dark Disabled Stories" is designed to serve both those with disabilities and those without. For those without, he hopes that the work will urge self-inquiry about each person's relationship to disability and the disabled. And for audience members with disabilities, the show offers an invitation to relate their own experiences to Haddad's. But neither community is guaranteed an easy ride.
"I could be taking care of both sets of people," Haddad said. "But instead, I'm saying, 'We're going to sit here and in the messiness of this together."' ALEXIS SOLOSKI
Guadalís Del Carmen
The playwright and actor Guadalís Del Carmen was supposed to go to law school. At least that was her mother's plan for her.
"She wanted me to go to Northwestern," Del Carmen said by phone one morning this month, and laughed affectionately. "She was very, very specific about that."
Born and raised in Chicago, the daughter of Dominican immigrants who were educators before they came to the United States, Del Carmen passively resisted the law school path. She took the LSAT without studying for it, lest she score high enough to get in.
But her new play "Bees and Honey," scheduled to start performances May 4 at MCC Theater, offers her mother a consolation prize. Its heroine, Johaira, is a lot like Del Carmen: a sharp, funny, driven Dominican American living in Washington Heights, in Upper Manhattan. Johaira, though, is also a lawyer -- passionate about her job, and stressed by it.
A comic drama, "Bees and Honey" focuses on the relationship between Johaira, a feminist prosecuting a sexual assault case, and her husband, Manuel, a good guy who is also, as Del Carmen says, "a low-key misogynist." Talk of sexism was very much in the air when she started writing the play in 2017, the year of the Women's Marches and the rise of the #MeToo movement.
"I've kind of always been interested in our interpersonal relationships during times of cultural shifts," she said from Louisville, Ky., where she was in actor mode, rehearsing for "La Egoista," a play by Erlina Ortiz. "And also, you know, I really wanted to see a love story between two people that looked and sounded like me."
In 2012, seeing Dominican characters in "In the Heights" gave Del Carmen a life-altering jolt. Still living in Chicago, already an actor, she realized that playwriting was also a possible avenue. Her first play, "Blowout," had its premiere in 2013.
As a Black woman of Latin American descent, she said she had never truly felt accepted in Chicago; people there routinely asked why she spoke Spanish, the language she'd learned at home. To them, she didn't look Latina.
Moving to New York in 2016, she found a sense of belonging among the large Dominican community in Washington Heights. But she was surprised to find that Dominican playwrights weren't being produced on the city's English-language stages.
"Bees and Honey" is part of her effort to change that. The Sol Project, which elevates work by artists of Latin American descent, developed the play at its SolFest in 2018 and is co-producing the run at MCC.
Melissa Crespo, the play's director, said Del Carmen's artistry lies in her deftness at interweaving comedy with difficult topics like "mental health and misogyny and colorism." There is also her ear for dialogue, which Crespo believes is "why TV is trying to scoop her up."
Del Carmen spent last summer on the writing staff of an HBO Max prequel to Stephen King's "It," she's been working on other projects with Amazon and FX, and she has already written the pilot of a possible TV adaptation of "Bees and Honey." Her career has been going so well that it's been more than a year since she's worked at her fallback occupation: dental hygienist.
She isn't certain that she's hung that up for good, though; a screenwriters strike may be looming. But she's positive she made the right call in snubbing a career in law to build a life as an artist instead.
"The funny thing is, when I was doing hygiene, I would get a lot of lawyers," she said. "And not one of them was happy." LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES

Polite and Soft-Spoken, But With a Wry Edge: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Christoph Waltz knows a few things about acting, and he has the Academy Awards to prove it. Yet in a recent conversation, he made light of the skills required.
"I don't believe in good actor, bad actor," he said. "If you're playing an interesting part in a worthwhile story and you're cast properly, you'd have to be a complete idiot to not be good."
It is difficult to tell how serious Waltz is when he makes this type of deliciously arch grand statement, just as it is difficult to pinpoint what exactly drives his latest screen creation -- the title character of the satirical new Amazon workplace thriller "The Consultant."
Adapted by the "Servant" creator Tony Basgallop from the 2015 novel by Bentley Little, the eight-episode series, debuting Friday on Prime Video, tells the story of a video game studio after the sudden, violent death of its young founder, which sends the company into a tailspin. Out of nowhere, an off-putting stranger named Regus Patoff (Waltz), who claims to be a hired consultant from Crimea, appears and takes over. It is obvious immediately that something is a little off -- or maybe a lot.
Like many of Waltz's best known characters, Regus is unfailingly soft-spoken and courteous -- even when firing a guy for how he smells -- as was Waltz, himself, on a recent morning in the Drawing Room of the Greenwich Hotel, in Lower Manhattan. And yet there is usually a wry edge to what he does, which often plays as ruthless in his characters, not least the two for which he won Oscars: an SS officer in Quentin Tarantino's "Inglourious Basterds" and a bounty hunter in Tarantino's "Django Unchained."
His character stays true to form in "The Consultant," which he described as "the first series that I've done." That isn't entirely accurate -- he has had many guest spots and he had regular roles in a few European series decades ago -- but it is the first time Waltz, 66, has carried a modern Hollywood series, and with a role so thoroughly Waltz-like. (A series of Quibi short-shorts in which he starred, "Most Dangerous Game," has since been condensed into a film.) Regus is as seductive as he is ominous, a frightening mix of outwardly pleasant and subtly menacing, a balance that Waltz has perfected over the years.
"On the page the character is very harsh and forthright, but onscreen there's only so far you can go in being nasty," Basgallop, who is also the showrunner, said in a video conversation. "You also have to have a lot of charm, which I think Christoph brought to it,"
In person, that edge Waltz brings to his roles is the furthest thing from menacing, but it does make for good sport. He is intellectual, playful, a little mischievous -- as likely to challenge a question as to answer it. A man of wide-ranging interests, he quoted or paraphrased Stanley Kubrick, Charles Eames, Albert Einstein, Timothy Snyder, Aristotle and Stephen Sondheim in the course of an 80-minute conversation.
In a typical rally, he hit a deceptively gentle lob back over the net after being asked if he had ever felt he nailed a scene or role.
"All this market-economy vocabulary: 'nailed it,"' he said. "Well, if you nail it, where do you nail it to? What kind of nail do you use? Why nail it in the first place? It can't go anywhere anymore. Wouldn't it be the goal to keep it flowing?"
He leaned back in his seat, smiling like the Cheshire Cat.
Born and raised in Vienna, Waltz spent decades bouncing around Europe in the workaday worlds of theater and television, doing the occasional film before landing his breakout role, in "Inglourious Basterds," which debuted when he was 52. At the time, he told The New York Times that after acting in a lot of comedies, playing the villain had become "sort of the flavor of the past few years."
Most of it wasn't particularly rewarding, but his relationship with Tarantino freed him to combine his facility for both comedy and villainy in more interesting ways -- and to be choosier. It also brought him to Los Angeles, where he has been living full-time since the mid-2010s. (Just before the pandemic, he added American citizenship to his Austrian and German ones: "I very much believe in this old dictum of no taxation without representation," he said, "and I wanted to be represented because I pay a lot of taxes here.")
With a successful run of films with some of the world's biggest directors under his belt (Wes Anderson, Guillermo Del Toro and Cary Joji Fukunaga among the most recent), he hesitated, at first, to sign on for a TV show. Television requires a particular leap of faith, he said, that films do not.
"They ask you to do a whole series but you don't get anything but the pilot," Waltz said. It was an experience he had never had before, and he described it with an unlikely metaphor.
"The fastest animal is an alligator, but only for five meters," he informed me. "So I thought, 'What kind of alligator is that, jumping at me?"'
Waltz has credited his analytical approach to acting, in part, to the technique of script interpretation taught by Stella Adler, to which he was exposed during a stint in New York beginning in the late 1970s. In his analysis, the power of his character in "The Consultant" rests in little more than people's eagerness to follow someone who assumes an air of authority.
"He never says, 'I am the boss' -- he just acts like a boss and everybody immediately accepts it," Waltz said.
He segued to Representative George Santos of New York, who has built a career on brazen lies and self-confidence -- but is still standing, even after being exposed.
"He should be sitting in a quiet corner, hoping that this thing passes," Waltz marveled with a gleam in his eye, like a gourmand about to dig into a particularly elaborate dessert. "Now it is pathology, clearly."
Waltz is interested in what makes people tick, but that doesn't mean he wants to find an explanation or a meaning behind every decision he makes as an actor. Or at least he doesn't want to dwell on it publicly.
"I don't talk about the process -- or sometimes have a, let's say, ironic distance to disclosing the process -- because it's a very personal thing," he said. "You follow inklings that you don't know where they're coming from."
Regus is the latest in a line of roles in which Waltz deploys an unshowy virtuosity: He does a lot with little. ("It's about the viewer, not the actor," he said. "I'm not interested in seeing the actor work; I'm interested in forgetting about the actor altogether.") Still, getting there takes plenty of experimentation and conversation that you don't see onscreen. Waltz's colleagues described him on set as collegial, honest and down to earth.
"When he speaks, you listen because you know it's heartfelt -- you don't think he's trying to sell you something or trying to convince you of something," Basgallop said. "He brings that to his characters as well -- someone who has a very strong intellect but is also very calm and measured.
"For some reason I think human beings find that terrifying: We're programmed to be scared of someone like that because they can outthink us."
It's tempting to draw parallels between Regus's hold on the video game company's staff and the one the best actors have on their audiences -- and, evidently, on some of their colleagues.
In a phone conversation, Nat Wolff, 28, who plays a coder, recalled shooting scenes in which his and Waltz's characters take off on a bonding expedition. At the end of a busy day, Wolff said, Waltz volunteered some feedback.
"He turned to me and he said, 'You were ...' He took a long pause while I felt my anxiety rising, and then he went ' ... exquisite today,"' he said. "I really wanted to get his approval, like a paternal figure."
The anecdote illustrates Waltz's dry humor and precise timing, as well as the way he envisions the best conversations: as impish dialectic. Wolff recalled telling Waltz that he had wanted to get a puppy.
"And he said, 'Think about it from the puppy's point of view,"' Wolff said, imitating his co-star's German accent. "'You're going to be off on set and the puppy is going to be thinking, Where's Nat?"'
"So I didn't get a puppy," he added, laughing. "Whatever Christoph says, you listen to and you follow."

LONDON — Growing up in the then-modest neighborhood of Hackney here, Arinzé Kene and his four siblings were convinced they were going to be the new Jackson Five.
“We would learn dance moves from music videos and perform them in the living room,” Kene said. “It was the beginning of knowing I wanted to be an entertainer.”
Kene, 35, was chatting before a rehearsal of “Misty,” his almost one-man show (two musicians accompany him) that will arrive at the Shed in New York City on March 3. The piece, which mixes spoken word, music, surreal comedy and performance, tells a tale of gentrification, racial tension and male identity. But it also humorously stages the pitfalls a Black actor faces in telling this tale, via disapproving messages from his friends about racial stereotyping.
“Misty,” directed by Omar Elerian, is the sixth play Kene has written. His acting career has encompassed varied roles, including Bob Marley in the musical “Get Up Stand Up!” and Biff Loman in Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman.”
The critics have swooned. “As much bumbling clown as muscular force to be reckoned with, by turns endearing and commanding,” Dominic Cavendish wrote of “Misty” in The Daily Telegraph after it transferred to the West End.
Kene, who exudes a combination of energy, focus and charisma, said he was “constantly creating” when growing up, writing songs and putting out mixtapes and an EP. But he began acting only after stumbling on a teenage drama group near his home. He was also a talented sportsman and academically accomplished; his parents, a taxi driver and a nurse who emigrated from Nigeria when Kene was 4, hoped he would become a doctor.
He tried to let them down gently. “Even after I got a three-month gig in the Boney M. musical, ‘Daddy Cool,’ they still thought I was going to university,” he said.
University didn’t happen, but regular acting jobs did, and at 21 he was playing a leading role in Ché Walker’s musical “Been So Long” at the Young Vic. That was the moment he began to believe in himself as an actor.
He was also writing, creating his first play, “Estate Walls,” during a writers course at the Royal Court Theatre. He spent two subsequent years in a whirlwind of writing and acting while participating in more writing and directing programs.
“Misty” emerged from a 2012 commission from Madani Younis, then the director of London’s Bush Theatre. (He is now the chief executive producer at the Shed.) For three years, Kene struggled to write, eventually offering to return the commission fee. Younis refused. Kene then “began to scribble” about his experience of moving back to Hackney, which was now undergoing rampant gentrification.
“The music just started happening,” he said. “I didn’t always know where the story was going, but I suddenly had a wellspring of information because it was my upbringing, my home.”
Although Kene’s plays have all drawn on his own experience, he hadn’t appeared in any of them. But after the actor performed the piece (before a small audience of the Bush artistic team, in the theater’s kitchen), Elerian persuaded him to take on the role.
“I was self-conscious about it,” he said. “Why would anyone care about my experience? But what I learned is that specific is interesting, honesty is interesting. If it’s the truth, people may lean forward.”

Talene Monahon
In Talene Monahon’s “Jane Anger,” William Shakespeare is portrayed not as an envy-inspiring wordsmith but as a pompous misogynist struggling with writer’s block during a plague.
“Every time I go into quarantine, I’m expected to be more prolific and timely than the last time,” he whines to his assistant.
Unlike her fictional Bard, Monahon had a most productive pandemic. Besides “Jane Anger,” she wrote “The Good John Proctor”; the Bedlam theater company production of the show begins previews March 12 at the Connelly Theater in New York City. Billed as a “prequel” to “The Crucible,” the play is a reimagining of the events leading up to the Salem witch trials, as experienced by four girls who spend much of their time discussing one another’s menstrual cycles and mysterious dreams.
It also hints at darker themes.
“I’m interested, for the purposes of the play, in childhood and girlhood and how trauma manifests in a society where there is no language for it and only language about the devil and witchcraft,” Monahon said over a video call this month.
“The Good John Proctor” shares DNA with Monahon’s other plays, which thoroughly emulsify history and fiction to give voice to previously marginal figures or to connect historical events to our moment.
“I think about this quote from Hilary Mantel all the time: ‘History is not the past — it is the method we have evolved of organizing our ignorance of the past,’” she said.
Monahon, 32, who grew up in Belmont, Massachusetts, attended Dartmouth College and now lives in Brooklyn, attributes her interest in history to her Armenian heritage. Family members had lived through the Armenian genocide, and she grew up with an awareness that historically grand narratives have a way of eliding certain events.
“From an early age, I was interested in what histories get taught, what doesn’t get taught, who teaches history, who controls the narrative,” she said.
Writing came relatively late to Monahon. As a child, she performed in musicals at her Unitarian Universalist church, and her professional acting credits have included productions at Roundabout Theatre Company (“Bobbie Clearly”) and Playwrights Horizons (“Log Cabin”).
“Writing was always something I kind of just did for myself,” she said.
The chance to do more of it presented itself during the pandemic, when Monahon worked on virtual playlets for the 24 Hour Plays. She likened the experience to going to graduate school for playwriting.
“I started figuring things out for myself about structure and form,” she said, “and I think that my writing improved.”
“The Good John Proctor” began its life as an exercise at the 24 Hour Plays. She fleshed it out with research — reading Stacy Schiff’s “The Witches: Suspicion, Betrayal, and Hysteria in 1692 Salem,” and traveling to Texas with Tavi Gevinson (who stars in the new play) to read through Arthur Miller’s papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
Her play joins a few others, like Sarah Ruhl’s “Becky Nurse of Salem” and Kimberly Belflower’s “John Proctor Is the Villain,” that wrestle with the legacy of the trials and of Miller’s canonical play.
Monahon stressed that her play is not a takedown of Miller’s.
“There’s so much in ‘The Crucible’ that I love, and there are also things that really frustrate me,” she said. “I feel excited to think about these events from a different angle.”

Ryan J. Haddad
In his past shows, writer and performer Ryan J. Haddad has ingratiated himself with audiences, using jokes to put spectators at ease. In his new one, “Dark Disabled Stories,” which begins performances at the Public Theater in New York City on Feb. 28, he takes a different approach.
“I try to make disability funny so that nondisabled people can understand it and open themselves to it and realize that it’s not so scary, so dark,” Haddad says early in the play. “Not tonight. I don’t feel like it.”
A one-man show with a difference, “Dark Disabled Stories” recounts Haddad’s journey through a world that doesn’t always accommodate his disability (cerebral palsy, which requires a walker and leg braces) or the disabilities of others. The stories are his own — some he experiences as a protagonist, others he simply observes. But he is joined onstage by Dickie Hearts, who performs the same tales in American Sign Language, and Alejandra Ospina, who provides audio description. The theater also offers expanded wheelchair seating, making “Dark Disabled Stories” the rare show that is accessible to all.
That’s a happy thing. But “Dark Disabled Stories” isn’t designed for uplift. It does not supply what Haddad, 31, refers to, with appropriate derision, as “inspiration porn” — tales of disabled people triumphing in the face of obstacles internal and external. He doesn’t believe that hope is what he owes an audience. What he owes them, he feels, is truth.
“We’ve been starved for stories about us,” Haddad said over breakfast in the lobby of the Public Theater. “What I’m telling, what I’m giving is a really honest portrait. And it’s a portrait of me.”
Nervy and emphatic, Haddad grew up in a Cleveland suburb, the youngest of three boys. His older brothers were star students and star athletes. But Haddad’s passion was theater, musical theater in particular.
While a student at Ohio Wesleyan University, he acted in the theater department’s plays, but he realized that if he wanted a more robust career, he would have to create work for himself. He debuted his solo show “Hi, Are You Single?” just after college and has written several other pieces, all of them autobiographical.
“Dark Disabled Stories” has some of the provocations of his earlier work. (The first story finds Haddad in a club’s restroom, a stranger’s hand down his pants.) But he has pushed himself to go deeper. The first time he tried out the piece, he could feel the energy in the room change.
“I knew it was a little relentless,” he said. “I also knew I should be able to tell the darker stories without having you pitying me.”
That “you” implies an able-bodied spectator, but “Dark Disabled Stories” is designed to serve both those with disabilities and those without. For those without, he hopes the work will urge self-inquiry about each person’s relationship to disability and the disabled. And for audience members with disabilities, the show offers an invitation to relate their own experiences to Haddad’s. But neither community is guaranteed an easy ride.
“I could be taking care of both sets of people,” Haddad said. “But instead, I’m saying, ‘We’re going to sit here and in the messiness of this together.’”

Guadalís Del Carmen
Playwright and actor Guadalís Del Carmen was supposed to go to law school. At least that was her mother’s plan for her.
“She wanted me to go to Northwestern,” Del Carmen said by phone one morning this month, and laughed affectionately. “She was very, very specific about that.”
Born and raised in Chicago, the daughter of Dominican immigrants who were educators before they came to the United States, Del Carmen passively resisted the law school path. She took the LSAT without studying for it, lest she score high enough to get in.
But her new play, “Bees and Honey,” scheduled to start performances May 4 at the off-Broadway MCC Theater, offers her mother a consolation prize. Its heroine, Johaira, is a lot like Del Carmen: a sharp, funny, driven Dominican American living in Washington Heights, in upper Manhattan. Johaira, though, is also a lawyer — passionate about her job, and stressed by it.
A comic drama, “Bees and Honey” focuses on the relationship between Johaira, a feminist prosecuting a sexual assault case, and her husband, Manuel, a good guy who is also, as Del Carmen says, “a low-key misogynist.”
Talk of sexism was very much in the air when she started writing the play in 2017, the year of the women’s marches and the rise of the #MeToo movement.
“I’ve kind of always been interested in our interpersonal relationships during times of cultural shifts,” she said from Louisville, Kentucky, where she was in actor mode, rehearsing for “La Egoista,” a play by Erlina Ortiz. “And also, you know, I really wanted to see a love story between two people that looked and sounded like me.”
In 2012, seeing Dominican characters in “In the Heights” gave Del Carmen a life-altering jolt. Still living in Chicago, already an actor, she realized that playwriting was also a possible avenue. Her first play, “Blowout,” had its premiere in 2013.
As a Black woman of Latin American descent, she said she had never truly felt accepted in Chicago; people there routinely asked why she spoke Spanish, the language she’d learned at home. To them, she didn’t look Latina.
Moving to New York in 2016, she found a sense of belonging among the large Dominican community in Washington Heights. But she was surprised to find that Dominican playwrights weren’t being produced on the city’s English-language stages.
“Bees and Honey” is part of her effort to change that. The Sol Project, which elevates work by artists of Latin American descent, developed the play at its SolFest in 2018 and is coproducing the run at MCC.
Melissa Crespo, the play’s director, said Del Carmen’s artistry lies in her deftness at interweaving comedy with difficult topics like “mental health and misogyny and colorism.” There is also her ear for dialogue, which Crespo believes is “why TV is trying to scoop her up.”
Del Carmen spent last summer on the writing staff of an HBO Max prequel to Stephen King’s “It,” she’s been working on other projects with Amazon and FX, and she has already written the pilot of a possible TV adaptation of “Bees and Honey.” Her career has been going so well that it’s been more than a year since she’s worked at her fallback occupation: dental hygienist.
She isn’t certain that she’s hung that up for good, though; a screenwriters strike may be looming. But she’s positive she made the right call in snubbing a career in law to build a life as an artist.
“The funny thing is, when I was doing hygiene, I would get a lot of lawyers,” she said. “And not one of them was happy.”

A Role Taken In Desperation Is His Big Break: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The actor plays John B. in the hit Netflix drama, which returns for its third season on Thursday.
Before Chase Stokes started playing John B., the teenage treasure hunter at the center of "Outer Banks," on Netflix, he played a fictional Hollywood manager, mass emailing talent agencies to tout an up-and-coming young actor named Chase Stokes.
He also worked as a bartender and a food photographer to make ends meet, and he spent months couch-surfing and occasionally sleeping in his 2009 BMW in the parking lot of the Ovation Hollywood (formerly Hollywood and Highland) mall as he took acting classes.
Despite his circumstances, Stokes said he initially turned down offers to audition for "Outer Banks" -- it felt like a "Goonies" remake, and he didn't want to besmirch a classic, he said. But eventually an apartment eviction notice and his car's overheating engine and expired tags convinced him to give it a shot. He considers himself lucky that he did.
"But I think luck is when consistency and determination and hard work meet," Stokes said.
"Outer Banks" is a teen drama about a group of attractive young adventurers (known as "pogues") battling their island community's rich kids ("kooks") and chasing treasure linked to the disappearance of John B.'s father. It debuted in 2020 but broke out when its second season premiered in July 2021, becoming Netflix's most watched English-language series globally for four weeks. A fan event to promote the third season drew more than 4,000 attendees to Huntington Beach, Calif., on Saturday, to watch performances by acts like Khalid and Lil Baby. The cast also took the stage to announce that the show had already been renewed for a fourth season.
Season 3 of "Outer Banks" begins on Thursday, following John B. and the other pogues as they take on new territory in another quest for gold after the first two seasons saw them successfully scavenge and subsequently lose treasures in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The crew was last seen on a deserted island they had named Poguelandia, and the unexpected discovery of John B.'s presumed-dead father, Big John (played by Charles Halford), sparks a new itch to uncover yet another bounty.
In a video call from a West Hollywood hotel, Stokes talked about how he initially declined the role that has made him famous and what "Outer Banks" says about friendship and the class divide. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
You initially turned down the "Outer Banks" audition. What convinced you to reconsider?
I really wasn't making money as an actor up until the job that I did right before "Outer Banks," which was a show on Amazon called "Tell Me Your Secrets." But the money had kind of run dry from that show -- I had an eviction notice on my door, the registration on my car had expired, my engine was steaming everywhere I went. I'm not a mechanic, so I didn't know how to fix it, nor did I have the money to do so.
After declining the "Outer Banks" audition a couple of times I got a call from Lisa Fincannon, a wonderful casting director, and she said, "You need to read for this." That was a Wednesday. Sunday came around, and I get a call and [my agent] said: "You're getting on a plane tonight. Here's 14 pages of dialogue. Here's the first four episodes. You're going to be on the very last row of a plane in the middle seat on a red eye, and you're going to land in Charleston. The audition is right when you get off the plane." And I did it, and the rest is history.
How would you describe "Outer Banks" to someone who hasn't seen it?
If "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Scooby-Doo" had a baby, and that baby became best friends with "The Goonies."
Was there anything about John B. that you particularly related to?
I feel like on the exterior, there are a lot of similarities. I grew up on the water; I grew up in Florida, about 30 minutes away from Cocoa Beach, so [I was familiar with] the surfing elements. I got my boater's license before I got my driver's license. I think one thing John B. goes through, especially in the third season, that I really related to was the anxiety of the world around him and the fear of failure. That's something that I've kind of always felt, so we definitely share that.
When did you know the show was a hit?
I think it was six months after the show came out when they finally told us we were going back for the second season. During Covid, seeing hundreds and hundreds of people show up to watch us film -- that was when I think we started to put two and two together.
They would follow our base camp. All of our trailers would set up in different areas of Charleston, and it would be like an alarm or a mass text would be sent out: You'd see people start to trickle in, and sometimes it'd be 20 people, sometimes it would be 2,000.
What have been some of your more interesting fan interactions?
I've had people who've fainted in front of me, and we've had people who have cried. I've had people telling me that I saved their lives, which is always interesting, to know the show has helped people through a troubling time in human history. So the range of emotions is super vast, but all equally heartwarming.
And now it's really cool because the whole Charleston community has really accepted us, and you walk down the street or you go to a restaurant and people kind of give you a wink or a thumbs up.
Are you going to the Poguelandia event?
Of course.
Where did the concert concept come from?
We haven't had a premiere; the show never had a red carpet. We've worked incredibly hard to create something the world has consumed at a really crazy rate, and obviously the platform sees it, and they wanted to congratulate us. I think it's an ode to the show: The show is kind of a party; it's kind of a riot. So why not throw a music festival?
"Outer Banks" revolves largely around the class divide between the working-class pogues and the wealthy kooks. Is there a message in there about class discrimination?
I think it's a testament to how there has consistently been a class divide not just in this country, but in the world. And the lower class is going to fight tooth and nail to find a way to make an extra buck, and the upper class is going to find a way to save an extra couple thousand bucks. There's a frustration that's inevitably going to be there, and I think that's the driving factor for the pogues. They're right there, you know? They can see it. It's so close to them, but they just can't comprehend how to get there.
What does the show say about friendship?
It's every kid's dream to have a group of friends who are going to ride or die and just go the distance with you, and these kids have grown up in an environment where they don't have a lot. So they learn to do a lot with a little, and it's a beautiful thing to see. I'm very proud and thankful to be part of a project that gives a true interpretation of friendship -- not just the highs of it but also the lows and showing just as much love as when the wins come around.
Has this friendship onscreen translated into one among the actors when the cameras are off?
All of us came into the show with slim-pickings resumes. So to get into this and to feel like we need to create this truth and transparency through these characters, you sort of fall in love with one another and build this crazy camaraderie and chemistry.
Do you think this friendship will carry beyond the show itself? How long do you think it will last?
I hope forever. It's been almost four years now, and I hope we do another 40.

Full text: The case, concerning a law that gives websites immunity for suits based on their users' posts, has the potential to alter the very structure of the internet.
WASHINGTON -- In a case with the potential to alter the very structure of the internet, the Supreme Court did not appear ready on Tuesday to limit a law that protects social media platforms from lawsuits over their users' posts.
In the course of a sprawling argument lasting almost three hours, the justices seemed to view the positions taken by the two sides as too extreme, giving them a choice between exposing search engines and Twitter shares to liability on the one hand and protecting algorithms that promote pro-ISIS content on the other.
At the same time, they expressed doubts about their own competence to find a middle ground.
"You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet," Justice Elena Kagan said of the Supreme Court, to laughter.
Others had practical concerns. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, echoing comments made in briefs, worried that a decision imposing limits on the shield "would really crash the digital economy with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you."
Drawing lines in this area, he said, was a job for Congress. "We are not equipped to account for that," he said.
The federal law at issue in the case, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, shields online platforms from lawsuits over what their users post and the platforms' decisions to take content down. Limiting the sweep of the law could expose the platforms to lawsuits claiming they had steered people to posts and videos that promote extremism, advocate violence, harm reputations and cause emotional distress.
The case comes as developments in cutting-edge artificial intelligence products raise profound new questions about whether old laws -- Section 230 was enacted in 1996 -- can keep up with rapidly changing technology.
"This was a pre-algorithm statute," Justice Kagan said, adding that it provided scant guidance "in a post-algorithm world." Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, meanwhile, marveled at advances in A.I. "Artificial intelligence generates poetry," he said. "It generates polemics."
The case was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old college student who was killed in a restaurant in Paris during the terrorist attacks in November 2015, which also targeted the Bataclan concert hall. Eric Schnapper, a lawyer for the family, argued that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, bore responsibility because it had used algorithms to push Islamic State videos to interested viewers, using information that the company had collected about them.
"We're focusing on the recommendation function," Mr. Schnapper said.
But Justice Clarence Thomas said that recommendations were vital to making internet platforms useful. "If you're interested in cooking," he said, "you don't want thumbnails on light jazz." He later added, "I see these as suggestions and not really recommendations because they don't really comment on them."
Mr. Schnapper said YouTube should be liable for its algorithm, which he said systematically recommended videos inciting violence and supporting terrorism. The algorithm, he said, was YouTube's speech and distinct from what users had posted.
Justice Kagan pressed Mr. Schnapper on the limits of his argument. Did he also take issue with the algorithms Facebook and Twitter use to generate people's feeds? Or with search engines?
Mr. Schnapper said all of those could lose protection under some circumstances, a response that seemed to surprise Justice Kagan.
"I can imagine a world where you're right that none of this stuff gets protection," she said. "And, you know, every other industry has to internalize the costs of its conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear. On the other hand, I mean, we're a court. We really don't know about these things."
Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked about whether Twitter users could be sued for retweeting ISIS videos. Mr. Schnapper said the law at issue in the case might allow such a suit. "That's content you've created," he said.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he was lost. "I don't know where you're drawing the line," he told Mr. Schnapper. "That's the problem."
Mr. Schnapper tried to clarify his position and in doing so revealed its breadth. "What we're saying is that insofar as they were encouraging people to go look at things," he said, "that's what's outside the protection of the statute."
Section 230 was enacted in the infancy of the internet. It was a reaction to a decision holding an online message board liable for what a user had posted because the service had engaged in some content moderation.
The provision said, "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."
The provision helped enable the rise of social networks like Facebook and Twitter by ensuring that the sites did not assume legal liability for every post.
Malcolm L. Stewart, a lawyer for the Biden administration, largely argued in support of the family's position in the case, Gonzalez v. Google, No. 21-1333. He said that successful lawsuits based on recommendations would be rare but that the immunity provided by Section 230 was generally unavailable.
Justice Kagan acknowledged that many suits would fail for reasons unrelated to Section 230. "But still, I mean, you are creating a world of lawsuits," she said. Justice Kavanaugh echoed the point.
Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer for Google, said the provision gave the company complete protection from suits like the one brought by Ms. Gonzalez's family. YouTube's algorithms are a form of editorial curation, she said. Without the ability to provide content of interest to users, she said, the internet would be a useless jumble.
"All publishing requires organization," she said.
She added: "Helping users find the proverbial needle in the haystack is an existential necessity on the internet. Search engines thus tailor what users see based on what's known about users. So does Amazon, TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, Yelp, Zillow, and countless video, music, news, job-finding, social media and dating websites. Exposing websites to liability for implicitly recommending third-party context defies the text and threatens today's internet."
A ruling against Google, she said, would either force sites to take down any content that was remotely problematic or to allow all content no matter how vile. "You have 'The Truman Show' versus a horror show," she said.
Justice Kagan asked Ms. Blatt if Section 230 would protect "a pro-ISIS" algorithm or one that promoted defamatory speech. Ms. Blatt said yes.
Section 230 has faced criticism across the political spectrum. Many liberals say it has shielded tech platforms from responsibility for disinformation, hate speech and violent content. Some conservatives say the provision has allowed the platforms to grow so powerful that they can effectively exclude voices on the right from the national conversation.
The justices will hear arguments in a related case on Wednesday, also arising from a terrorist attack. That case, Twitter v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, was brought by the family of Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in a terrorist attack in Istanbul in 2017.
The question in that case is whether Twitter, Facebook and Google may be sued under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990, on the theory that they abetted terrorism by permitting the Islamic State to use their platforms. If the justices were to say no, the case against Google argued on Tuesday could be moot.
Whatever happens in the cases argued this week, both involving the interpretation of statutes, the court is very likely to agree to consider a looming First Amendment question arising from laws enacted in Florida and Texas: May states prevent large social media companies from removing posts based on the views they express?

In Saudi Arabia, Single Tweet Can Lead to Decades in Prison: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The kingdom's courts are meting out harsher punishments than ever to citizens who criticize the government, with prosecutions built on Twitter posts ending in prison sentences of 15 to 45 years.
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- One day in November 2015, Saad Almadi typed out a 14-word post on Twitter about Saudi Arabia's deputy crown prince.
"Mohammed bin Salman has taken over the economy, defense and everything under the king," he wrote, replying to a professor who is a fierce critic of the kingdom's monarchy.
A Saudi-American dual citizen living in Florida, Mr. Almadi had little reason to believe his post would attract attention. He was a retired project manager, not an activist, and his words were largely factual -- Prince Mohammed had taken control of many of the levers of power since his father became king that year. By 2017, he would push aside a cousin to become heir to the throne.
Yet the tweet resurfaced as evidence seven years later when Mr. Almadi, 72, was arrested during a visit to Saudi Arabia. Along with other Twitter posts he wrote that were critical of the Saudi government -- and an "insulting picture" of Prince Mohammed saved on his phone -- the tweet was cited as proof that he had "adopted a terrorist agenda by defaming symbols of the state" and "supported terrorist ideology," according to court documents.
His prosecutor requested a severe punishment, "to rebuke him and deter others." In October, Mr. Almadi was sentenced to 16 years in prison, lengthened on Feb. 8 to 19 years after he appealed.
Saudi Arabia has always been an authoritarian monarchy with limited freedom of speech. But 10 years ago, Mr. Almadi's Twitter account, which has fewer than 2,000 followers, might have prompted a warning or an interrogation. Under Prince Mohammed, now prime minister, harsher punishments are being meted out to citizens who criticize their government, while the defendants on trial have become increasingly less prominent.
"My father is nowhere near being a dissident," said Mr. Almadi's son, Ibrahim Almadi, describing him as an open-minded man who spent his retirement traveling, hiking and wine tasting. Now he is being held in Al-Ha'ir prison, a facility in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, that houses members of Al Qaeda alongside political activists.
"The scope of oppression really is unprecedented," said Hala Aldosari, a women's rights activist who left Saudi Arabia in 2014 for a postdoctoral fellowship in the United States and said she never felt safe enough to return.
Since then, Prince Mohammed has rendered the conservative Islamic kingdom nearly unrecognizable, setting in motion seismic changes -- some of which activists like Ms. Aldosari spent years campaigning for.
He launched an ambitious plan to diversify the oil-dependent economy and ended a slew of religious and social restrictions that many Saudis found suffocating. Women, barred from driving until 2018, now work as Amazon delivery drivers, chief executives and ambassadors. Music, once effectively prohibited in public, thumps inside dimly lit restaurants where young couples flirt. The gender segregation that shaped public life for decades has dissolved.
At the same time, the modest space for political discourse has shriveled.
"It's a bittersweet moment in history, where you see the fruits of your mobilization somehow yielded, but for the wrong reason," Ms. Aldosari said. "The people are being shut down or silenced in return for giving them certain rights."
Since 2017, the Saudi authorities have arrested hundreds of public figures across the political spectrum, including Snapchat influencers, religious clerics, billionaires and several of the prince's own cousins. The killing in 2018 of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, prompting international outrage, was the most dramatic example of a broader crackdown that has continued to deepen since his death.
The authorities have paid special attention to Twitter, which is widely used in the kingdom.
Noura al-Qahtani, who ran an anonymous Twitter account, was among several people put on trial last year in relation to social media activity. On her account, where she had roughly 600 followers, she called for anti-government protests, criticized some social liberalization measures and wrote that Prince Mohammed was "not good enough to be a prince."
After a court found her guilty of "challenging the faith and justice of the king and the crown prince" and "supporting the ideology of people who strive to disturb public order," among other charges, she was sentenced to 13 years in prison. On appeal, she pleaded for mercy, saying that she was nearly 50 and had five children to take care of, according to a copy of her verdict. Instead, the panel of judges lengthened her sentence to 45 years in prison.
Around the same time, Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi doctoral student at Leeds University in Britain, was sentenced to 34 years in prison, largely in relation to following Saudi dissidents on Twitter and sharing their posts, according to a copy of her verdict.
The court sentenced both women under counterterrorism and cybercrime laws. Both were given an additional penalty at the discretion of the judges.
A Saudi official said in a statement to The New York Times that the government was studying and putting new measures in place to enhance human rights, including changes to the judicial system. However, Saudi Arabia "maintains a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to terrorism," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with government protocol.
The official did not respond to questions about specific prisoners, including Mr. Almadi, Ms. al-Qahtani and Ms. al-Shehab, saying only that "cases of individuals that violate national laws are clearly differentiated from peaceful expressions of opinion."
Yet a review of the detainees' Twitter accounts -- which were the basis for their indictments -- did not reveal posts professing support for militant groups or endorsing violent action, aside from a vague tweet by Ms. al-Qahtani that referred to "removing this tyrant from the face of the earth," without mentioning a name. Instead, their prosecutors cited posts critical of the government or royal family members and labeled them terrorism-related views that threatened state security, according to court documents.
Until recently, prison sentences longer than 20 years were rare in the kingdom, and Saudis with American citizenship or ties to local elites, like Mr. Almadi, would have been able to draw on connections to protect themselves.
"One of the merits of Mohammed bin Salman is that he's created equality of injustice for all," said Taha al-Hajji, a Saudi lawyer who lives in exile in Germany.
The "red lines" that curbed freedom of expression were also more obvious under previous rulers: the royal family, the king, Islam. Now, many people have "absolutely no idea" what is permissible, said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
"It's designed to create a climate of intimidation, at the political register, which is meant to inoculate the regime," he said.
In an interview in 2018, Prince Mohammed denied creating an atmosphere of fear. If he had, he added, it was "a small price" to pay to "get rid of extremism and terrorism without civil war, without stopping the country from growing, with continuous progress in all elements."
Many Saudis are deeply disturbed by the crackdown, even if it has not touched them personally. And yet the rapid transformation of their country offers plenty of rewards and distractions that have also been widely welcomed. High oil prices last year helped the economy grow by more than 8 percent, the fastest rate among the Group of 20 industrialized nations.
"The kingdom is in a sensitive historical transformation phase in all aspects," said Salman Al-Ansari, a Saudi political analyst. "No one can deny the speed in which the reforms are taking place. But like anything else, reforms come with a cost."
Some Saudis believe the trade-off is worth it. To others, including Ms. Aldosari, it is a betrayal.
"This is not what we aspired to," she said. "We aspired for a community where we are heard, where we are seen, we are respected and we are included in decision-making."
Ms. Aldosari blamed American and European foreign policies for the escalation in repression, saying that foreign governments had elevated other goals -- like getting Arab governments to normalize relations with Israel, or securing stable oil markets -- at the expense of human rights.
The Biden administration pledged to put human rights "at the center" of American foreign policy. When President Biden visited Saudi Arabia last summer and shared a fist-bump with Prince Mohammed, Saudi dissidents saw it as a retreat.
"Advancing human rights in Saudi Arabia is a key priority for the United States," the State Department said in a statement, noting that U.S. officials "regularly raise" cases, including those of Mr. Almadi, Ms. al-Shehab and Ms. al-Qahtani, with Saudi officials. "We continue to have significant concerns with the imposition of severe sentences for the exercise of freedom of expression."
There are also a growing number of Saudis living in exile in the United States, unable to reunite with their families. Among them is Maha al-Qahtani, whose husband, Mohammed al-Qahtani, was once a prominent Saudi political activist. (They are not related to Noura al-Qahtani.)
An economics professor, Mr. al-Qahtani co-founded an independent human rights organization in 2009. In 2013, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Maha al-Qahtani eventually settled in the United States with their five children, counting the years until her husband's sentence ended in November.
In October, they were preparing for his release, gathering the gifts they bought while he was in prison, when Mr. al-Qahtani stopped calling home. Maha al-Qahtani sought help from every authority she could reach out to, but found no explanation. Mr. al-Qahtani has effectively disappeared.
"This is the father of my children, my husband, my love," she said in a phone interview, her voice breaking. "Where are you?"

WASHINGTON — In a case with the potential to alter the very structure of the internet, the Supreme Court did not appear ready Tuesday to limit a law that protects social media platforms from lawsuits over their users’ posts.
In the course of a sprawling argument lasting almost three hours, the justices seemed to view the positions taken by the two sides as too extreme, giving them a choice between exposing search engines and Twitter shares to liability on the one hand and protecting algorithms that promote pro-Islamic State group content on the other.
At the same time, they expressed doubts about their own competence to find a middle ground.
“You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet,” Justice Elena Kagan said of the Supreme Court, to laughter.
Others had practical concerns. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, echoing comments made in briefs, worried that a decision imposing limits on the shield “would really crash the digital economy with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you.”
Drawing lines in this area, he said, was a job for Congress. “We are not equipped to account for that,” he said.
The federal law at issue in the case, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, shields online platforms from lawsuits over what their users post and the platforms’ decisions to take content down.

Malcolm L. Stewart, a lawyer for the Biden administration, largely argued in support of the family’s position in the case, Gonzalez v. Google, No. 21-1333. He said that successful lawsuits based on recommendations would be rare but that the immunity provided by Section 230 was generally unavailable.
Kagan acknowledged that many suits would fail for reasons unrelated to Section 230. “But still, I mean, you are creating a world of lawsuits,” she said. Kavanaugh echoed the point.
Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer for Google, said the provision gave the company complete protection from suits like the one brought by Gonzalez’s family. YouTube’s algorithms are a form of editorial curation, she said. Without the ability to provide content of interest to users, she said, the internet would be a useless jumble.
“All publishing requires organization,” she said.
She added: “Helping users find the proverbial needle in the haystack is an existential necessity on the internet. Search engines thus tailor what users see based on what’s known about users. So does Amazon, TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, Yelp, Zillow, and countless video, music, news, job-finding, social media and dating websites. Exposing websites to liability for implicitly recommending third-party context defies the text and threatens today’s internet.”
A ruling against Google, she said, would either force sites to take down any content that was remotely problematic or to allow all content no matter how vile. “You have ‘The Truman Show’ versus a horror show,” she said.
Kagan asked Blatt if Section 230 would protect “a pro-ISIS” algorithm or one that promoted defamatory speech. Blatt said yes.
Section 230 has faced criticism across the political spectrum. Many liberals say it has shielded tech platforms from responsibility for disinformation, hate speech and violent content. Some conservatives say the provision has allowed the platforms to grow so powerful that they can effectively exclude voices on the right from the national conversation.
The justices will hear arguments in a related case Wednesday, also arising from a terrorist attack. That case, Twitter v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, was brought by the family of Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in a terrorist attack in Istanbul in 2017.
The question in that case is whether Twitter, Facebook and Google may be sued under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990, on the theory that they abetted terrorism by permitting the Islamic State group to use their platforms. If the justices were to say no, the case against Google argued Tuesday could be moot.
Whatever happens in the cases argued this week, both involving the interpretation of statutes, the court is very likely to agree to consider a looming First Amendment question arising from laws enacted in Florida and Texas: May states prevent large social media companies from removing posts based on the views they express?

‘Equality of Injustice for All’: Saudi Arabia Expands Crackdown on Dissent

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — One day in November 2015, Saad Almadi typed out a 14-word post on Twitter about Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince.
“Mohammed bin Salman has taken over the economy, defense and everything under the king,” he wrote, replying to a professor who is a fierce critic of the kingdom’s monarchy.
A Saudi American dual citizen living in Florida, Almadi had little reason to believe his post would attract attention. He was a retired project manager, not an activist, and his words were largely factual — Mohammed bin Salman had taken control of many of the levers of power since his father became king that year. By 2017, he would push aside a cousin to become heir to the throne.
Yet the tweet resurfaced as evidence seven years later when Almadi, 72, was arrested during a visit to Saudi Arabia. Along with other Twitter posts he wrote that were critical of the Saudi government — and an “insulting picture” of Crown Prince Mohammed saved on his phone — the tweet was cited as proof that he had “adopted a terrorist agenda by defaming symbols of the state” and “supported terrorist ideology,” according to court documents.
His prosecutor requested a severe punishment, “to rebuke him and deter others.” In October, Almadi was sentenced to 16 years in prison, lengthened Feb. 8 to 19 years after he appealed.
Saudi Arabia has always been an authoritarian monarchy with limited freedom of speech. But 10 years ago, Almadi’s Twitter account, which has fewer than 2,000 followers, might have prompted a warning or an interrogation. Under Crown Prince Mohammed, now prime minister, harsher punishments are being meted out to citizens who criticize their government, and the defendants on trial have become increasingly less prominent.
“My father is nowhere near being a dissident,” said his son, Ibrahim Almadi, describing him as an open-minded man who spent his retirement traveling, hiking and wine tasting. Now he is being held in Al-Ha’ir prison, a facility in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, that houses members of al-Qaida alongside political activists.
“ The scope of oppression really is unprecedented,” said Hala Aldosari, a women’s rights activist who left Saudi Arabia in 2014 for a postdoctoral fellowship in the United States and said she never felt safe enough to return.
Since then, Crown Prince Mohammed has rendered the conservative Islamic kingdom nearly unrecognizable, setting in motion seismic changes — some of which activists like Aldosari spent years campaigning for.
He launched an ambitious plan to diversify the oil-dependent economy and ended a slew of religious and social restrictions that many Saudis found suffocating. Women, barred from driving until 2018, now work as Amazon delivery drivers, CEOs and ambassadors. Music, once effectively prohibited in public, thumps inside dimly lit restaurants where young couples flirt. The gender segregation that shaped public life for decades has dissolved.
At the same time, the modest space for political discourse has shriveled.
“It’s a bittersweet moment in history, where you see the fruits of your mobilization somehow yielded, but for the wrong reason,” Aldosari said. “The people are being shut down or silenced in return for giving them certain rights.”
Since 2017, Saudi authorities have arrested hundreds of public figures across the political spectrum, including Snapchat influencers, religious clerics, billionaires and several of the crown prince’s own cousins. The killing in 2018 of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, prompting international outrage, was the most dramatic example of a broader crackdown that has continued to deepen since his death.
Authorities have paid special attention to Twitter, which is widely used in the kingdom.
Noura al-Qahtani, who ran an anonymous Twitter account, was among several people put on trial last year in relation to social media activity. On her account, where she had about 600 followers, she called for anti-government protests, criticized some social liberalization measures and wrote that Crown Prince Mohammed was “not good enough to be a prince.”
After a court found her guilty of “challenging the faith and justice of the king and the crown prince” and “supporting the ideology of people who strive to disturb public order,” among other charges, she was sentenced to 13 years in prison. On appeal, she pleaded for mercy, saying that she was nearly 50 and had five children to take care of, according to a copy of her verdict. Instead, the panel of judges lengthened her sentence to 45 years in prison.
Around the same time, Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi doctoral student at Leeds University in Britain, was sentenced to 34 years in prison, largely in relation to following Saudi dissidents on Twitter and sharing their posts, according to a copy of her verdict.
The court sentenced both women under counterterrorism and cybercrime laws. Both were given an additional penalty at the discretion of the judges.
A Saudi official said in a statement to The New York Times that the government was studying and putting new measures in place to enhance human rights, including changes to the judicial system. However, Saudi Arabia “maintains a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to terrorism,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with government protocol.
The official did not respond to questions about specific prisoners, including Almadi, al-Qahtani and al-Shehab, saying only that “cases of individuals that violate national laws are clearly differentiated from peaceful expressions of opinion.”
Yet a review of the detainees’ Twitter accounts — which were the basis for their indictments — did not reveal posts professing support for militant groups or endorsing violent action, aside from a vague tweet by al-Qahtani that referred to “removing this tyrant from the face of the earth,” without mentioning a name. Instead, their prosecutors cited posts critical of the government or royal family members and labeled them terrorism-related views that threatened state security, according to court documents.
Until recently, prison sentences longer than 20 years were rare in the kingdom, and Saudis with U.S. citizenship or ties to local elites, like Almadi, would have been able to draw on connections to protect themselves.
“One of the merits of Mohammed bin Salman is that he’s created equality of injustice for all,” said Taha al-Hajji, a Saudi lawyer who lives in exile in Germany.
The “red lines” that curbed freedom of expression were also more obvious under previous rulers: the royal family, the king, Islam. Now, many people have “absolutely no idea” what is permissible, said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
“It’s designed to create a climate of intimidation, at the political register, which is meant to inoculate the regime,” he said.
In an interview in 2018, Crown Prince Mohammed denied creating an atmosphere of fear. If he had, he added, it was “a small price” to pay to “get rid of extremism and terrorism without civil war, without stopping the country from growing, with continuous progress in all elements.”
Many Saudis are deeply disturbed by the crackdown, even if it has not touched them personally. Yet the rapid transformation of their country offers plenty of rewards and distractions that have also been widely welcomed. High oil prices last year helped the economy grow by more than 8%, the fastest rate among the Group of 20 industrialized nations.
“The kingdom is in a sensitive historical transformation phase in all aspects,” said Salman Al-Ansari, a Saudi political analyst. “No one can deny the speed in which the reforms are taking place. But like anything else, reforms come with a cost.”
Some Saudis believe the trade-off is worth it. To others, including Aldosari, it is a betrayal.
“This is not what we aspired to,” she said. “We aspired for a community where we are heard, where we are seen, we are respected and we are included in decision-making.”
Aldosari blamed U.S. and European foreign policies for the escalation in repression, saying that foreign governments had elevated other goals — such as getting Arab governments to normalize relations with Israel, or securing stable oil markets — at the expense of human rights.
The Biden administration pledged to put human rights “at the center” of U.S. foreign policy. When President Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia last summer and shared a fist-bump with Crown Prince Mohammed, Saudi dissidents saw it as a retreat.
“Advancing human rights in Saudi Arabia is a key priority for the United States,” the State Department said in a statement, noting that U.S. officials “regularly raise” cases, including those of Almadi, al-Shehab and al-Qahtani, with Saudi officials. “We continue to have significant concerns with the imposition of severe sentences for the exercise of freedom of expression.”
There are also a growing number of Saudis living in exile in the United States, unable to reunite with their families. Among them is Maha al-Qahtani, whose husband, Mohammed al-Qahtani, was once a prominent Saudi political activist. (They are not related to Noura al-Qahtani.)
An economics professor, Mohammed al-Qahtani co-founded an independent human rights organization in 2009. In 2013, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Maha al-Qahtani eventually settled in the United States with their five children, counting the years until her husband’s sentence ended in November.
In October, they were preparing for his release, gathering the gifts they bought while he was in prison, when Mohammed al-Qahtani stopped calling home. Maha al-Qahtani sought help from every authority she could reach out to, but found no explanation. Mohammed al-Qahtani has effectively disappeared.
“This is the father of my children, my husband, my love,” she said in a phone interview, her voice breaking. “Where are you?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Doubly Cool, and Able to Connect: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a pairing that seems almost predestined, the actresses are sharing a stage in "The Seagull/Woodstock, NY," a contemporary riff on Chekhov.
In a show-business world full of square pegs and round holes, Parker Posey and Hari Nef are 12-sided dice.
Posey, 54, has forged an unclassifiable career since her days as the "it" girl of 1990s independent cinema -- mirrored in her oddball 2018 book, "You're on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir." She has created a series of indelible characters in Christopher Guest comedies, including "Best in Show," but has also memorably brought her off-kilter rhythms to high-profile gigs like the flamboyant assistant district attorney Freda Black in the HBO Max mini-series "The Staircase" and the scheming Dr. Smith on the Netflix reboot of "Lost in Space."
As for Nef, 30, she landed the recurring role of Gittel in the Amazon series "Transparent" days after graduating from Columbia University, in 2015. The first openly transgender woman to receive a worldwide modeling contract, Nef also writes for various magazines, appeared in the Off Broadway play "Des Moines" in December, and has a couple of big projects arriving later this year: Greta Gerwig's "Barbie" movie and the HBO series "The Idol" in which she'll appear alongside the Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp.
In a meeting that seems almost predestined, the pair are now sharing a stage in Thomas Bradshaw's "The Seagull/Woodstock, NY," a New Group production in previews at the Pershing Square Signature Center. (It is scheduled to open Feb. 28 and run through March 26.) A contemporary riff on Chekhov set in the Catskills, the play renames the charismatic, brittle actress Irina Arkadina as Irene (Posey), while the moody, romantic Masha has become Sasha (Nef).
"They're iconic in who they are and what they bring to their work," the play's director, Scott Elliott, said of Nef and Posey during a phone call. "They're able to bring themselves to the parts so there's very little separation between the actor and the role. Their humanity peeks through."
This quality helps explain why both New York-based actresses have a similar ability to connect with a character's pathos, while also deploying unerring comic timing: Posey's turns in those Guest films are pitch-perfect, while Nef was praised by Ben Brantley, in his review of Jeremy O. Harris's play "'Daddy,"' for delivering "the production's sharpest satirical performance."
Naturally, there are generational differences. In a chat following a rehearsal, in January, Nef mused about taking Posey to a rave while Posey reminisced about visiting classic ballroom dance halls in Berlin. And yet they connect. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
What did you know of each other before "The Seagull/Woodstock, NY"?
PARKER POSEY Hari Nef -- oh, she was in "Transparent." I remembered exactly what a performance that was and how much she lit up a scene. She changed the temperature of the room. I don't keep up with a lot of things. I don't have a lot of social media -- I forgot my Instagram password a while ago and I tried to sign on a few times with the password I thought I remembered. But of course it was the wrong password.
HARI NEF I knew so much about your work. "Party Girl" is a favorite, but I'd also seen you on "Search Party," the whole gamut. A friend of mine said that you in "The House of Yes" is probably one of the greatest screen performances he's ever seen. And he doesn't play.
POSEY When we met for the first read-through, Thomas said, "I've just got to tell you, 'The House of Yes' was a big inspiration for me and my writing." That [script] was Wendy MacLeod's Yale thesis. I didn't know that playwriting can be so subversive.
NEF I was always so attracted to you and your work because you were glamorous and you were dramatic and you were cool and you were distinctive and uncompromising, but not in a way that was obvious or traditional. You are beautiful and talented, that is obvious and traditional, but you always did things your way. I knew that if I was going to make a career as an actor, much less as an actress, I would have to do things non-traditionally. I didn't have anyone quite exactly like me to look to so I looked at your work and I looked at Tilda [Swinton] and Chloë [Sevigny].
POSEY I got lucky because at a time in the culture, you could do Off Broadway and afford your $ 700 a month apartment. And you could do independent movies: "It's only 22 days, yeah, I'll do that one." It was kind of punk rock or like being in a band. Everyone was hanging out together and it was very organic. It was a little pocket of time that didn't last that long.
NEF I've been able to spend my entire fall and winter doing Off Broadway shows because I did Fashion Week before this and that visibility brings other opportunities. You can get paid three, four, five times what I'm going to make for both these plays combined by going to one dinner and being photographed there in an outfit. I post images of the films I like on Instagram not just because I find them inspiring and beautiful -- I do -- but it's me going, "I want to be in movies like this."
POSEY You're having the best of both worlds because to be online and have a social media presence is kind of to be your own magazine. I need to learn. But that time is a different time; it is your generation's time right now.
NEF You're literally from the last moment where it was possible to be cool. Looking at that capital-C definition of cool all the way back to Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, there's talent, there's glamour, there's drive, there's darkness. But there's also a mystery and a specificity, and you lose that mystery and specificity by existing online. Because of the money thing and the rent thing, it has become essentially untenable to be cool, to be mysterious, to have that allure being an indie legend.
Do you think it's one thing to be perceived as cool and another to be taken seriously as an actor?
NEF So much of my entry into this industry and this practice was around "Transparent." I was riding on this flotilla of discourse about things that had nothing to do with what I could do as an actor. I thought I had to sing for my supper just for a seat at the table. Maybe I was right, to a certain extent, but it became like, "Do I really want people to know me by what I say or what I am or what my private medical history is?" No, I want to be known for what I do as an actor.
POSEY Cool is when there's something original or unexpected, or seems to have some kind of luck around it. Which your appearing on that show was: the unexpected, something new, something fresh. And that is not orchestrated -- that's luck. I see that now. I look at life and the path of an actor as having that luck. And I think that's very enviable.
NEF I've been very lucky. I remain lucky. The play I did before "Daddy" was my senior thesis in college: I played Arkadina in "The Seagull." I had gone through what I had gone through in college and I never thought that I would get to go onstage to do Chekhov, much less play her. I knew that I probably wouldn't be able to play a role like that again for many, many years -- not because of age but because of the size and the heft of the role. I haven't played a role like Arkadina since then, but I'm back doing "The Seagull" and that is more than was promised to me at that moment in history.
Parker, what drew you to Arkadina/Irene?
POSEY What attracted me the most to this part was the narcissistic mother, and the power that a mother has over her son. And she's a showbiz mom, someone with a lot of heart and theatricality and all that. I'm so lucky as a middle-aged woman to be playing this part. It's interesting to observe how quick people are to villainize strong women, how fun it is to see the worst. People love to call someone a bitch. I mean, the misogyny is on fire, still.
NEF I play a lot of bitches.
Why do you think that is?
NEF Well, I'm no ingénue. I write, and a lot of the bitches I've played are also writers, thinkers. Smart. "Bitch" is often a fill-in for intelligent, for articulate, for opinionated, queer, not conventionally feminine or not conventionally beautiful. I think the "Barbie" stuff happened because I didn't play bitchy and I didn't play dumb and I didn't play plastic in the audition.
POSEY Having been cast as a female Dr. Smith, that was such a coup, I was so grateful for that gig. If you can live in Hollywood, it's a lot easier to get cast and be a part of that world. But I wanted to walk around and see other people.
NEF What is your relationship to the word "scene-stealer"? It's the word that really follows me. It's not a bad thing: It means I'm doing good work in small roles.
POSEY That is a character actor making strong choices. When you have a small role in something big, you have to fill it in a certain way, and that's its own thing.
NEF If you're a bold flavor -- which I know I am -- it's more intuitive for people to see you as seasoning to the steak. I'd like to be the steak someday, but I know I have to earn it. So many of your iconic roles have been supporting and I'm wondering if you ever felt minimized by it.
POSEY [long pause] Your 20s are really intense and then the culture changes and you're, like, "Where am I going to fit in? I'm going to be in 'Blade: Trinity' playing a vampire? Never thought I'd see the day but yeah, I want to work and that'll be interesting." And then it's the 40s. It's heartbreaking when you become aware of just how intensely male-dominated our stories are, especially when you mature as a person and as a woman.
NEF The shifts in the culture are by and large cosmetic when it comes to power and who gets the green light and who gets the sign-off for studio things. I can't control the way I'm cast or how people see me.
POSEY But you can see and acknowledge where you are. You're in the mix. We're so lucky to do what we love to do. A lot of people don't.
NEF That's the bottom line of gratitude right now. This sounds corny but every day I'm so grateful to be here with you, to be here with everyone, to work through this winter onstage. It's not guaranteed for anyone, much less someone like me or you.

Villain Leaps From a Game Into Little Arms: [Style Desk]

Full text: You'll meet his bloodshot, menacing gaze in any number of neighborhoods in New York, his mouth stretched into an open, hungry grin, his tentacle-like limbs ready to envelop you. On Mott Street in Chinatown, he is lashed to display racks in front of shops selling New York City-themed cooking aprons or "Got Weed?" T-shirts; in Bushwick, he's a frequent presence on the tabletops of sidewalk sellers. He might be blue, or orange or tie-dye, or even wearing a little Santa hat and Christmas scarf.
His name is Huggy Wuggy, and he has joined the ranks of unavoidable knockoff toys and trinkets marketed to toddlers, teens and Hot Topic adults all over the world: Bosnia, Spain, Laos, South Korea or anywhere else you might find a tourist-trap souvenir shop or market of bootleg goods.
Among those who sell Huggy, many don't seem to know exactly where he comes from or what he is. But they know he's popular with children -- and the parents willing to drop $ 10 to appease them.
For instance, outside Ma68 Trading in Manhattan, Huggy was available on a recent visit in gray, red or green, each clipped to a circular clothes rack, strappado style. There, the toy is so popular that the signature blue version is often sold out.
"I think he's from a TV show," George Ma, the store's owner, said vaguely. (Not exactly.) "He's most popular with 4- to 9-year-olds." (This tracks.)
In fact, Huggy Wuggy is the primary villain of an indie horror video game called Poppy Playtime, set in an abandoned toy factory. Huggy, one of the toys formerly made in the factory, is first seen in a display with a happy, innocent smile before he mysteriously disappears. Players solve various puzzles, and later, he chases them through the factory's ventilation system, his smile since widened to reveal razor-sharp teeth that he uses to eat the game's losers.
It's freaky. But what makes Huggy truly unsettling is his second life on YouTube, where children as young as preschool age come across fan tribute videos to the character -- and then become fans themselves.
It's a strange lesson in the porous boundaries between media for many children, who are unwittingly led by Silicon Valley's many and mysterious algorithms to follow their favorite characters no matter the context, online and off.
Remixing Stock Characters for the Internet
Ezra Watkins, a 6-year-old in Manchester, England, first came across Huggy Wuggy on ExtremeToys TV, a YouTube channel that features two young brothers playing video games, having Nerf battles and creating short vlog-style films in which they chase and unmask various monsters like Bigfoot, Chucky and Huggy, all created using special effects.
Ezra's father, Gareth Watkins, says he sees Huggy as part of an "extended universe" of children's internet characters. "It's almost like the stock characters in commedia dell'arte or pantomime: Anyone can pick them up and use them for whatever they like and the audience will understand them," he said.
While Mr. Watkins allows his son to watch YouTube videos featuring Huggy, he believes the game itself is a bit too frightening for Ezra. "Even though there isn't adult content or blood, the jump scares are much harsher than what you'd find in all-ages games," he said.
For his part, Ezra says that Huggy is "scary, like real scary. It was supposed to be friendly but no." Still, Ezra claims to love horror, and says he hopes to be able to play the game eventually.
Poppy Playtime was an unexpected hit for Mob Entertainment, the small studio that released the game in 2021. "It's not that common, from what I hear anecdotally from other video game developers, that your first game would be a success to the extent that this one has been," said Zach Belanger, Mob's chief executive and the creator of Huggy Wuggy.
Mr. Belanger, 25, found his way to video game making via YouTube fan mash-ups himself.
At 18, he and his then-16-year-old brother Seth found popularity with their own channel, EnchantedMob, by making videos that remixed familiar characters from properties like the indie horror game Five Nights at Freddy's or Minecraft.
Eventually, with a small staff and the profits from their YouTube videos, the brothers developed and self-published Poppy Playtime on the independent gaming platform Steam.
YouTube, once again, was pivotal to the game's success. Just one day after Poppy Playtime's release, a popular horror gaming YouTuber posted a walk-through video of himself playing Poppy Playtime for his millions of subscribers. That video now has 33 million views. While Mob declined to share the total number of times Poppy Playtime has been downloaded, the game -- once $ 4.99, now free -- has over 47,000 reviews on Steam.
Why Do Kids Like Huggy Wuggy?
Though not an animator himself, Mr. Belanger developed the early concept design for Huggy Wuggy. The idea, mainly, was to create something entirely new.
"Is he a monkey? Is he a sock monkey? Is he a bear?" Mr. Belanger said. "He's a thing, but not really anything. He's an animal, but not one you've ever seen before."
To make the creature frightening, Mr. Belanger's technique was simple: make it really big compared with everything else onscreen. The conceit applied not only to Huggy Wuggy's height, but to his lanky limbs and outsize smile that, as the game progresses, morphs into more of a hungry maw.
"The great monsters in horror are all really simple," said Jenna Stoeber, who has covered horror media and video games for Polygon. According to Ms. Stoeber, Huggy's face instantly telegraphs terror. "It's clearly a toy designed to be cute that has been twisted and warped and now it has this mouthful of horrible jagged teeth."
Ms. Stoeber suggested that children are more open to horror figures than adults might suspect.
As for why the game itself took off, she speculated that it was ideal for Twitch users livestreaming their game play for an audience: It's short, for one thing, and it offers "the chance to have jump scares and 'ahhh' faces," Ms. Stoeber said. "YouTube videos that have big human faces making weird expressions always do well."
The remixes, like the one Ezra Watkins happened across, also helped. In them, Huggy interacts with video game characters from other franchises -- which might lead fans of those other games to discover him. And the digital illustrators who make these remixes often place the characters into simple, emotion-driven plots that children can grasp, and which give Huggy a range of feelings he doesn't display in the original game.
"Of course Huggy Wuggy himself can look kind of freaky, with his teeth and all that, but my family is a little unconventional in that we find things like that funny," said Amanda Paulin of Salem, Ore., whose 5-year-old son sleeps with Huggy plushies every night after his older sisters introduced him to the character. "We haven't run into the scary Huggy Wuggy yet, but we know he's out there."
Ms. Paulin said the content her son had been exposed to so far had been "fairly silly." "When my son first saw the character," she added, "he laughed really hard."
It's easy for a child to become familiar with Huggy without having ever even heard of the game. YouTube is teeming with videos created specifically for children, and the platform goes to great lengths to keep them watching as long as possible. While YouTube has cleaned up some of its children's content (you can't find scary Poppy Playtime-related videos on YouTube Kids, for example) and now gives parents the option to turn off its autoplay feature, the site still sends viewers down rabbit holes.
"There's a lot of creators out there that will just create videos that are meant to game the algorithm for small children whose parents put an iPad in front of them and let YouTube videos play while they make dinner," said Ted Hentschke, head of productions at DreadXP, a horror game publisher in Los Angeles.
The Offline Knockoff Market
Because the Huggy that children know is often detached from the Huggy of the game, the market for physical Huggy toys doesn't differentiate much between the original character and his digital knockoffs. Though almost all of these plushies feature the villainous face and body structure, many come in colors that never actually appear in the game.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of those toys are themselves unlicensed.
The game came out in October 2021, and "by November, there were already knockoff Huggy dolls," said Drake Vogl, a licensing assistant at Mob.
It took the company five months from the game's release to develop its own licensed Poppy Playtime products, giving other manufacturers ample opportunity to create and distribute knockoff Huggy merchandise to meet the growing demand.
"We've had to fight trademark and copyright squatters worldwide," Mr. Vogl said.
Arsenio Navarro, Mob Entertainment's director of business development, estimated that counterfeit products have cost the company millions of dollars in royalty revenue. According to Trevor Vogl, a Mob financial analyst, "upwards of 500,000" plush dolls and toys exported from China that were based on the company's characters have been seized and destroyed by customs officials; a service that Mob uses to identify counterfeit vendors has flagged more than 300,000 online listings for products featuring Mob's intellectual property.
The company is targeting e-commerce operations and international manufacturers peddling fake Huggys. According to Mr. Navarro, more than 15,000 Amazon listings have been taken down in the last three months alone.
Mob is working on expanding the world of Huggy. Poppy Playtime: Chapter 2 was released last May, and a multiplayer game set in the factory was released in December. And though the fake Huggys might represent money lost, they have also served as an enormous unplanned marketing campaign for the brand.
"Most of our fans have never played our game," Mr. Belanger said. "The brand awareness is greater than our ability to monetize it successfully to this point." And as for the knockoffs, "it's a good problem to have, I'm told," he said. To this day, Mob has never spent any money on marketing its games.

Magic: The Gathering Generates $1 Billion in Sales for Hasbro: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fantasy card game has surpassed the sales of the 100-year-old company's other brands, including Transformers and G.I. Joe, but some are worried about the downsides of rapid growth.
Richard Neal has been playing Magic: The Gathering, a fantasy card game, for nearly two decades. Two or three nights a week, he heads to Mox Boarding House, a game store in Bellevue, Wash., wielding a deck he has painstakingly built over the years.
"I go there probably more than my fiancé would like," said Mr. Neal, a 31-year-old software engineer for Apple. His devotion, and that of millions of other fans, has helped Hasbro steadily build the game into a global behemoth.
On Thursday, the company announced that Magic had become its first billion-dollar brand in terms of annual sales, surpassing other toy lines in its stable, like Transformers and G.I. Joe.
That milestone was achieved after 30 years of nurturing the game for longtime fans while finding ways to coax new players to pick it up. It was a "winning playbook," as Chris Cocks, the chief executive of Hasbro, put it in an interview.
Since it was introduced in the mid-1990s, more than 50 million people -- including the rapper Post Malone and the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- have played Magic in hobby shops and around kitchen tables around the world. The game casts players as wizards who derive their powers by picking cards from the decks they have built, drawing from an ever-expanding universe of cards that are bought, sold and traded in a thriving secondary market. Magic's popularity has spawned a cottage industry of video games, comic books, a Caribbean cruise and an animated series in development for Netflix.
On Friday, Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro unit that publishes the game, will kick off MagicCon in Philadelphia.
After the initial buzz when it first appeared, Magic flew under the radar for many years, said Gerrick Johnson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers the toy industry. "Now you get to see how big it is," he added. "I don't think there is any toy brand that is even half that size."
But Hasbro faces challenges making Magic even bigger, particularly player fatigue brought on by the release of 39 new card sets last year, up from 15 in 2019, according to an analysis by Bank of America. New sets can start around $ 50.
With consumers squeezed by inflation and economic growth slowing down, Hasbro's reliance on Magic for growth has taken on a new urgency. On Thursday, the toymaker reported a loss of nearly $ 130 million in the fourth quarter, versus a profit of more than $ 80 million in the same period a year before, as consumers spent less on toys during the crucial holiday shopping season. Last month, the company said it would lay off 15 percent of its workers as it sought to cut up to $ 300 million in costs.
Magic generated nearly $ 1.1 billion in revenue in 2022, up 7 percent from the year before. The game accounted for 18 percent of Hasbro's overall revenue last year, higher than its 16 percent share in 2021.
Magic, which was created in 1993 by a mathematician, Richard Garfield, was the first modern trading card game, combining "the excitement of cards with the thrill of trading and collecting," according to Guinness World Records. Its success helped inspire other games, notably Pokémon.
Themed sets and booster packs for Magic are sold at 6,500 mom-and-pop game stores like Mox Boarding House that are part of Hasbro's Wizards Play Network, as well as in mass retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart.
"Magic is a complicated game, and we try to demystify that," said Mary Holocher, the operations manager at Mox Boarding House, which has three stores in the Seattle area and is planning to open another in Chandler, Ariz.
In 2019, Wizards of the Coast released Magic: The Gathering Arena, a digital version of the game, which attracted players when pandemic restrictions kept them at home. "It's been our most valuable tool for engaging new players," Mr. Cocks said.
Mr. Neal tries not to miss Mox's Friday Night Magic event, a tournament for amateur players that is organized by the Wizards Play Network. He is aiming for a spot on Hasbro's pro tour, but that requires a strong deck, which can take time and money to build.
He estimated that he spent $ 20,000 on Magic last year. "I buy a lot of cards," he said.
As Magic expands, it is drawing new audiences to venues like Mox, which embraces inclusion and diversity. "I am a nonbinary person, and traditionally the scene is male dominated," said Katelyn Hassan, 34, a stay-at-home parent who went to Mox last Friday to play Magic competitively for the first time. "If I go anywhere to do this, I'm going to go there."
As players seek the strongest cards to bolster their decks, they often turn to the secondary market, buying and selling cards at stores like Mox and on websites like TCGplayer.com.
"Last year, I sold a couple of cards that I had in my collection for a long time," said Chris Crilley, a 34-year-old Target employee in Wantagh, N.Y. "They were just sitting there, and I realized one was a $ 500 card."
Some cards can fetch far more: The most valuable card is the Black Lotus, which was sold at auction in 2021 for more than $ 500,000. But some players say they have become concerned that an oversupply of card sets is diluting the value of their collections.
In November, a Bank of America report took Hasbro to task for what it saw as an overly busy release schedule, saying it lowered the value of Magic cards and weakened the franchise. Hasbro's shares fell 10 percent the day the report was released, underscoring how important the card game has become to the 100-year-old company.
Mr. Johnson, the BMO analyst, agreed that flooding the market could hurt a collectible brand like Magic. "If you have a weak secondary market, that weakens the primary market, too," he said. "Collectors get disillusioned; that's the worst thing that could happen."
Hasbro's stock has fallen 40 percent over the past year, lagging rival toymaker Mattel as well as the broader stock market.
Hasbro has defended its strategy, saying it is necessary to attract new players. That includes a series called Universes Beyond, which incorporates other franchises into Magic like Final Fantasy, Lord of the Rings and Doctor Who. The release of a Warhammer 40,000 crossover set last year was seen as a major success. "We couldn't keep it in stock," said Ms. Holocher of Mox.
"That's a nice area of growth for us," Mr. Cocks said of the brand extensions. But he added that Hasbro took Bank of America's warning about overproduction seriously. "I don't think you can be a winning team unless you can be open to self-reflection," he said.
But Mr. Cocks said he was confident in the staying power of Magic. "When you look at the long sweep of 30 years -- same-store sales, the value of the product, the size of the business -- in general, everything is going in the right direction," he said.

Tesla Accused of Firing Union Backers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A filing to the National Labor Relations Board called the dismissals retaliatory. The carmaker denied the allegation, saying they were based on performance.
BUFFALO -- Barely 24 hours after a group of software workers at a Tesla factory in Buffalo issued a letter declaring their intention to unionize, firings began. And the organizers said it was not a coincidence.
In a filing to the National Labor Relations Board, organizers said at least 18 employees were dismissed Wednesday "in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity." Tesla workers involved in the union campaign said Thursday that the number had grown to 37.
The workers said in interviews that most of those let go had not been involved in the campaign. Typically Tesla fires a small number of workers in March after performance reviews, they said -- but they had never seen so many dismissed at once.
"It's very suspect that all of this started to happen the day after the letter was sent to the company," Arian Berek, a data annotation specialist involved in the Buffalo organizing committee, said in an interview. She was laid off Wednesday.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has been blunt in his opposition to unions, and the company has a reputation for using hardball tactics against union organizers.
It is illegal for a company to fire workers for so-called protected concerted activity such as seeking to unionize. The Rochester, N.Y., branch of the Workers United union, in its filing, said the firings were unlawful and asked the labor relations board to seek a court order reinstating the workers with back pay.
Late Thursday, Tesla put a statement on its website declaring, "There is a false allegation that Tesla terminated employees in response to a new union campaign." It said that the dismissals in Buffalo had resulted from a semiannual global review process based on performance, and that those affected were identified for dismissal on Feb. 3.
The plant makes solar panels and components for charging equipment, according to Tesla's website. It has about 2,000 workers, including 800 who help develop driver-assistance software. Tesla said that the dismissals affected 27 people in the software group, which it called "the Autopilot labeling team," and that the employees "received prior feedback on their poor performance." It said only one "officially identified as part of the union campaign."
The workers pushing for a union are seeking more pay at the factory, where wages start around $ 19 an hour. Some said they were also motivated by perceived insensitivity from Tesla management.
Ms. Berek said she had become involved in the union because of increasing demands by management and more stringent tracking of employee activities. "It's gotten very militant over the last few months," she said. "If you have to go to the bathroom or have some kind of emergency, you can get penalized."
Company representatives told her that she had been dismissed as part of a drive to accelerate company performance, and also cited absenteeism, Ms. Berek said. They said it had nothing to do with her involvement in the union, she added.
Jaz Brisack, an organizer with Workers United who has been involved in the campaign, said in an interview on Tuesday that workers had decided to go public with their organizing effort partly to make it easier for them to communicate.
Ms. Brisack, who was an early leader of the Starbucks union campaign, said that many of the Tesla workers had complained of being closely monitored at their computers and that being public would give them more freedom to have conversations about the union campaign.
The movement began among the software workers, who are trying to win support from co-workers in manufacturing. There is normally little interaction among employees for the different operations, workers said.
The labor dispute could complicate Tesla's relationship with President Biden, who on Wednesday praised the company's decision to open up a portion of its charging network to owners of other electric vehicles.
The move seemed to represent an improvement in the relationship between Mr. Biden and Mr. Musk, who had complained that the administration paid insufficient attention to Tesla during its push for electric vehicle subsidies.
But Mr. Biden has also cast himself as a strong defender of unions. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement Thursday that "the president supports fundamental rights for workers under the National Labor Relations Act, including the right to organize free from intimidation and coercion."
Companies run by Mr. Musk have been accused in the past of illegally firing employees involved in organizing efforts. But adjudication of employment law can be slow and inefficient.
In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Tesla had illegally fired a worker involved in organizing at the company's car factory in Fremont, Calif., more than three years earlier, and that Mr. Musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized.
The board ordered Tesla to reinstate the worker with back pay and ordered Mr. Musk to delete a Twitter post making the implied threat. The post appears to still be active as the company appeals the ruling in federal court.
Last year, SpaceX, the rocket manufacturer that Mr. Musk started, fired at least eight employees after they helped to write a letter to management urging the company to distance itself from Mr. Musk's sometimes inflammatory statements on Twitter and to better enforce the company's policies on sexual harassment and discrimination.
The employees filed charges of unfair labor practices with the labor board in November; the cases are pending.
After employees file a charge, a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board must investigate. If the regional office finds merit in the accusation, it will give the company a chance to settle the charge and will issue a complaint in the absence of a settlement. The complaint is then litigated before an administrative judge, whose ruling can be appealed to the labor board in Washington, then to federal court.
The process can take years, but the labor board can ask a federal judge to issue an injunction reinstating the workers as the case runs its course. While the board has sometimes been reluctant to use this approach, Jennifer Abruzzo, the agency's general counsel, issued a memo last year instructing regional offices to make it a more common practice.
Companies facing high-profile union efforts, like Amazon and Starbucks, have disciplined and fired workers involved in organizing over the past few years. Both companies have denied violating labor law and say they have taken the steps as a response to violations of company policies.
"The only reason not to do it is if there's going to be some really meaningful political and economic consequences for breaking the law -- if they're going to face some kind of really severe customer backlash," said John Logan, a professor at San Francisco State University who is an expert on anti-union campaigns.
But given Mr. Musk's reputation as a hard-charging boss who doesn't hesitate to fire workers he perceives as disloyal, Tesla's concerns about a possible backlash may be minimal.
"Tesla clearly doesn't care about its reputation with liberals when it comes to labor relations," Sam Abuelsamid, an auto industry analyst at Guidehouse Insights, said in an email.

Magic: The Gathering Becomes a Billion-Dollar Brand for Toymaker Hasbro

As Magic expands, it is drawing new audiences to venues such as Mox, which embraces inclusion and diversity. “I am a nonbinary person, and traditionally, the scene is male dominated,” said Katelyn Hassan, 34, a stay-at-home parent who went to Mox last Friday to play Magic competitively for the first time. “If I go anywhere to do this, I’m going to go there.”
As players seek the strongest cards to bolster their decks, they often turn to the secondary market, buying and selling cards at stores such as Mox and on websites such as TCGplayer.com.
“Last year, I sold a couple of cards that I had in my collection for a long time,” said Chris Crilley, a 34-year-old Target employee in Wantagh, New York. “They were just sitting there, and I realized one was a $500 card.”
Some cards can fetch far more: The most valuable card is the Black Lotus, which was sold at auction in 2021 for more than $500,000. But some players say they have become concerned that an oversupply of card sets is diluting the value of their collections.
In November, a Bank of America report took Hasbro to task for what it saw as an overly busy release schedule, saying it lowered the value of Magic cards and weakened the franchise. Hasbro’s shares fell 10% the day the report was released, underscoring how important the card game has become to the 100-year-old company.
Johnson agreed that flooding the market could hurt a collectible brand such as Magic. “If you have a weak secondary market, that weakens the primary market, too,” he said. “Collectors get disillusioned; that’s the worst thing that could happen.”
Hasbro’s stock has fallen 40% over the past year, lagging rival toymaker Mattel as well as the broader stock market.
Hasbro has defended its strategy, saying it is necessary to attract new players. That includes a series called Universes Beyond, which incorporates other franchises into Magic such as Final Fantasy, Lord of the Rings and Doctor Who. The release of a Warhammer 40,000 crossover set last year was seen as a major success. “We couldn’t keep it in stock,” said Holocher.
“That’s a nice area of growth for us,” Cocks said of the brand extensions. But he added that Hasbro took Bank of America’s warning about overproduction seriously. “I don’t think you can be a winning team unless you can be open to self-reflection,” he said.
But Cocks said he was confident in the staying power of Magic. “When you look at the long sweep of 30 years — same-store sales, the value of the product, the size of the business — in general, everything is going in the right direction,” he said.

NEW YORK — In a show-business world full of square pegs and round holes, Parker Posey and Hari Nef are 12-sided dice.
Posey, 54, has forged an unclassifiable career since her days as the “it” girl of 1990s independent cinema — mirrored in her oddball 2018 book, “You’re on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir.” She has created a series of indelible characters in Christopher Guest comedies, including “Best in Show,” but has also memorably brought her off-kilter rhythms to high-profile gigs like the flamboyant assistant district attorney Freda Black in the HBO Max miniseries “The Staircase” and the scheming Dr. Smith on the Netflix reboot of “Lost in Space.”
As for Nef, 30, she landed the recurring role of Gittel in the Amazon series “Transparent” days after graduating from Columbia University, in 2015. The first openly transgender woman to receive a worldwide modeling contract, Nef also writes for various magazines, appeared in the off-Broadway play “Des Moines” in December, and has a couple of big projects arriving later this year: Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” movie and the HBO series “The Idol” in which she’ll appear alongside the Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp.
In a meeting that seems almost predestined, the pair are now sharing a stage in Thomas Bradshaw’s “The Seagull/Woodstock, NY,” a New Group production in previews at the Pershing Square Signature Center. (It is scheduled to open Feb. 28 and run through March 26.) A contemporary riff on Chekhov set in the Catskills, the play renames the charismatic, brittle actress Irina Arkadina as Irene (Posey), while the moody, romantic Masha has become Sasha (Nef).
“They’re iconic in who they are and what they bring to their work,” the play’s director, Scott Elliott, said of Nef and Posey during a phone call. “They’re able to bring themselves to the parts so there’s very little separation between the actor and the role. Their humanity peeks through.”
This quality helps explain why both New York-based actresses have a similar ability to connect with a character’s pathos, while also deploying unerring comic timing: Posey’s turns in those Guest films are pitch-perfect, while Nef was praised by Ben Brantley, in his review of Jeremy O. Harris’ play “‘Daddy,’” for delivering “the production’s sharpest satirical performance.”
Naturally, there are generational differences. In a chat following a rehearsal, in January, Nef mused about taking Posey to a rave while Posey reminisced about visiting classic ballroom dance halls in Berlin. And yet they connect. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: What did you know of each other before “The Seagull/Woodstock, NY”?
PARKER POSEY: Hari Nef — oh, she was in “Transparent.” I remembered exactly what a performance that was and how much she lit up a scene. She changed the temperature of the room. I don’t keep up with a lot of things. I don’t have a lot of social media — I forgot my Instagram password a while ago and I tried to sign on a few times with the password I thought I remembered. But of course it was the wrong password.
HARI NEF: I knew so much about your work. “Party Girl” is a favorite, but I’d also seen you on “Search Party,” the whole gamut. A friend of mine said that you in “The House of Yes” is probably one of the greatest screen performances he’s ever seen. And he doesn’t play.
POSEY: When we met for the first read-through, Thomas said, “I’ve just got to tell you, ‘The House of Yes’ was a big inspiration for me and my writing.” That [script] was Wendy MacLeod’s Yale thesis. I didn’t know that playwriting can be so subversive.
NEF: I was always so attracted to you and your work because you were glamorous and you were dramatic and you were cool and you were distinctive and uncompromising, but not in a way that was obvious or traditional. You are beautiful and talented, that is obvious and traditional, but you always did things your way. I knew that if I was going to make a career as an actor, much less as an actress, I would have to do things non-traditionally. I didn’t have anyone quite exactly like me to look to so I looked at your work and I looked at Tilda [Swinton] and Chloë [Sevigny].
POSEY: I got lucky because at a time in the culture, you could do off-Broadway and afford your $700 a month apartment. And you could do independent movies: “It’s only 22 days, yeah, I’ll do that one.” It was kind of punk rock or like being in a band. Everyone was hanging out together and it was very organic. It was a little pocket of time that didn’t last that long.
NEF: I’ve been able to spend my entire fall and winter doing off-Broadway shows because I did Fashion Week before this and that visibility brings other opportunities. You can get paid three, four, five times what I’m going to make for both these plays combined by going to one dinner and being photographed there in an outfit. I post images of the films I like on Instagram not just because I find them inspiring and beautiful — I do — but it’s me going, “I want to be in movies like this.”
POSEY: You’re having the best of both worlds because to be online and have a social media presence is kind of to be your own magazine. I need to learn. But that time is a different time; it is your generation’s time right now.
NEF: You’re literally from the last moment where it was possible to be cool. Looking at that capital-C definition of cool all the way back to Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, there’s talent, there’s glamour, there’s drive, there’s darkness. But there’s also a mystery and a specificity, and you lose that mystery and specificity by existing online. Because of the money thing and the rent thing, it has become essentially untenable to be cool, to be mysterious, to have that allure being an indie legend.
Q: Do you think it’s one thing to be perceived as cool and another to be taken seriously as an actor?
NEF: So much of my entry into this industry and this practice was around “Transparent.” I was riding on this flotilla of discourse about things that had nothing to do with what I could do as an actor. I thought I had to sing for my supper just for a seat at the table. Maybe I was right, to a certain extent, but it became like, “Do I really want people to know me by what I say or what I am or what my private medical history is?” No, I want to be known for what I do as an actor.
POSEY: Cool is when there’s something original or unexpected, or seems to have some kind of luck around it. Which your appearing on that show was: the unexpected, something new, something fresh. And that is not orchestrated — that’s luck. I see that now. I look at life and the path of an actor as having that luck. And I think that’s very enviable.
NEF: I’ve been very lucky. I remain lucky. The play I did before “Daddy” was my senior thesis in college: I played Arkadina in “The Seagull.” I had gone through what I had gone through in college and I never thought that I would get to go onstage to do Chekhov, much less play her. I knew that I probably wouldn’t be able to play a role like that again for many, many years — not because of age but because of the size and the heft of the role. I haven’t played a role like Arkadina since then, but I’m back doing “The Seagull” and that is more than was promised to me at that moment in history.
Q: Parker, what drew you to Arkadina/Irene?
POSEY: What attracted me the most to this part was the narcissistic mother, and the power that a mother has over her son. And she’s a showbiz mom, someone with a lot of heart and theatricality and all that. I’m so lucky as a middle-aged woman to be playing this part. It’s interesting to observe how quick people are to villainize strong women, how fun it is to see the worst. People love to call someone a bitch. I mean, the misogyny is on fire, still.
NEF: I play a lot of bitches.
Q: Why do you think that is?
NEF: Well, I’m no ingénue. I write, and a lot of the bitches I’ve played are also writers, thinkers. Smart. “Bitch” is often a fill-in for intelligent, for articulate, for opinionated, queer, not conventionally feminine or not conventionally beautiful. I think the “Barbie” stuff happened because I didn’t play bitchy and I didn’t play dumb and I didn’t play plastic in the audition.
POSEY: Having been cast as a female Dr. Smith, that was such a coup, I was so grateful for that gig. If you can live in Hollywood, it’s a lot easier to get cast and be a part of that world. But I wanted to walk around and see other people.
NEF: What is your relationship to the word “scene-stealer”? It’s the word that really follows me. It’s not a bad thing: It means I’m doing good work in small roles.
POSEY: That is a character actor making strong choices. When you have a small role in something big, you have to fill it in a certain way, and that’s its own thing.
NEF: If you’re a bold flavor — which I know I am — it’s more intuitive for people to see you as seasoning to the steak. I’d like to be the steak someday, but I know I have to earn it. So many of your iconic roles have been supporting and I’m wondering if you ever felt minimized by it.
POSEY: [long pause] Your 20s are really intense and then the culture changes and you’re, like, “Where am I going to fit in? I’m going to be in ‘Blade: Trinity’ playing a vampire? Never thought I’d see the day but yeah, I want to work and that’ll be interesting.” And then it’s the 40s. It’s heartbreaking when you become aware of just how intensely male-dominated our stories are, especially when you mature as a person and as a woman.
NEF: The shifts in the culture are by and large cosmetic when it comes to power and who gets the green light and who gets the sign-off for studio things. I can’t control the way I’m cast or how people see me.
POSEY: But you can see and acknowledge where you are. You’re in the mix. We’re so lucky to do what we love to do. A lot of people don’t.
NEF: That’s the bottom line of gratitude right now. This sounds corny but every day I’m so grateful to be here with you, to be here with everyone, to work through this winter onstage. It’s not guaranteed for anyone, much less someone like me or you. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A C.E.O.'s Desire to Do Good Meets Hard Economic Reality: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many years ago, Thich Nhat Hanh, the Buddhist monk and spiritual leader, posed a question to Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce.
"What is more important, being successful or being happy?" he asked.
Mr. Benioff answered pretty much the way you would expect a Silicon Valley entrepreneur to answer.
"Both," he said.
Thich Nhat Hanh cautioned that "if everything is important, nothing is important." But for many years it seemed that Mr. Benioff, just like Silicon Valley itself, was able to have success as well as happiness -- not to mention money, respect and influence.
Salesforce, which makes software to help companies sell better, became a hard-driving and influential tech company, the biggest employer in San Francisco. Mr. Benioff, 58, became a philanthropist, the advocate for a new model of capitalism and, at least in the Bay Area, as inescapable as the 61-story tower that bears his company's name.
Then came 2022. Suddenly Salesforce made less money. The stock wilted. An activist investor, Starboard Value, bought a stake, never good news for management. Mr. Benioff's co-chief executive, Bret Taylor, abruptly departed after only a year in the job. He was the second co-chief executive to do so, leaving the question of succession to Mr. Benioff's 24-year reign at the company in doubt.
Last month, Salesforce said it would lay off 10 percent of its staff, a decision that seemed to go against Mr. Benioff's repeated declarations that the company was one big family. He was chastised on social media for handling the cuts poorly. A second activist investor, Elliott Management, bought a stake in Salesforce. Then another and another and another. For those keeping count, that's five.
"Marc believes you can have a great company, give great returns to your shareholders and help your community and your planet, all at the same time," said Steve Fisher, a longtime Salesforce employee who was also a teenage friend of Mr. Benioff's. "This is one of the times when that notion is being tested."
Salesforce's troubles, like those of many of its tech peers in this moment of turmoil, spring from the pandemic. Three years ago, it looked as if technology might save humanity. For tens of millions of people, tech was suddenly the interface between their couch and their job.
"In the darkest depths of the pandemic, I was like, 'How will we ever get out of this?"' Mr. Benioff said in one of a series of conversations with The New York Times over the past week. Maybe, he thought, we would not. "I felt we were going to be pivoting much more aggressively to an all-digital day."
Salesforce's big pandemic purchase, announced in late 2020, was the remote-work app Slack for $ 28 billion. If everyone was going to stay on Slack all day long forever, it was cheap at that price. But they didn't, and it wasn't.
The troubles at Salesforce may be more wide ranging, but they are mirrored all over the tech industry. About 100,000 tech workers have been laid off since the beginning of the year, according to Layoffs.fyi. That's a rounding error for the larger economy, but these workers were until recently among the best paid and best treated. The notion that free massages, say, might no longer be part of the Silicon Valley experience was yet more evidence that tech was losing its pandemic grip.
Salesforce never offered massages, but its corporate philosophy promotes the idea that its workers are special. A word Mr. Benioff tosses around a lot is "Ohana," which he picked up in Hawaii. "Ohana represents the idea that families -- blood-related, adopted, or intentional -- are bound together, and that family members are responsible for one another," Salesforce's website says.
Mr. Benioff sees no contradiction between layoffs and the Salesforce Ohana. Families are sometimes difficult.
"I wish I offered lifetime employment," he said. "But the reality is when you have a big company with 80,000 employees, there are going to be times you have to make a head count adjustment. Our layoff packages are some of the most generous ever." The dismissed employees got a minimum of nearly five months' pay.
It may have come as a shock to some, he added, but layoffs at Salesforce are nothing new.
"There's been some hard times since we began in 1999," he said. "It's not all up and to the right. But this is the opportunity for growth. If you're in a steady state, you don't grow."
A random sampling of laid-off Salesforce employees contacted through employment sites yielded few who wanted to complain about Mr. Benioff, even anonymously. "I think he got lost somewhere, had too many sycophants telling him what he wanted to hear," one offered. That was as savage as it got.
Mr. Benioff, though, had lots to say, often by text -- sometimes words but also photos, links and emojis. His mother, Joelle, said in an interview that he was "not a big talker" as a child but now has words to spare. At a virtual company meeting after last month's layoffs, he talked for two hours.
Bad idea, he says now.
"We were trying to explain the unexplainable," Mr. Benioff said. "It's hard to have a call like that with such a large group and have it be effective, and we paid a price." Other tech companies didn't bother with hand holding: They just cut off their former employees' access in the middle of the night.
It was a rough month at Salesforce. Mr. Benioff went to one of his favorite places, French Polynesia, for a 10-day digital detox.
"We are so addicted to our devices (at least I am) it's very freeing to leave them all behind for a while!" he wrote in a text.
On an earlier trip, he had contributed $ 1 million in cash to local pandemic relief. For these and other services to the French, he is now a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur. He made his family listen to the speech.
Any conversation with Mr. Benioff inevitably touches on his grandfather Marvin E. Lewis, a San Francisco trial lawyer and politician who was a major force behind BART, the regional transit system.
Mr. Lewis was best known for developing the concept of "psychic injury." His most famous case, in 1970, was called "The Cable Car Named Desire." A dancer, Gloria Sykes, said she had hit her head in a cable car accident, lost her "mental balance" and developed "an insatiable appetite for sex" as well as other problems, including at least one suicide attempt. With Mr. Lewis as her lawyer, Ms. Sykes was awarded $ 50,000 by a jury.
"He was truly a visionary," Mr. Benioff said. "He was in business as a lawyer but made the world a better place." He texted a photo of a tribute to Mr. Lewis in a BART station that calls him "a determined prophet."
If a lawyer can scale these heights, why not a tech executive? Especially if he can make himself happy in the process?
"You're not going to be happy if you're not giving to others," Mr. Benioff said. "A lot of my tech peers are extremely unhappy."
Salesforce, and Mr. Benioff, have undoubtedly made major contributions to the well-being of San Francisco. But more questions are being asked these days about the inherent contradictions of working for the powerful to aid the powerless. As a reviewer on Amazon wrote of Mr. Benioff's book "Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change": "Benioff often seems surprised at the scale of the problems in the world, despite many of his customers playing a part in them."
"Marc makes himself a target for criticism by positioning himself as much more than a rampant capitalist tech bro," said Joshua Greenbaum, a software industry analyst with Enterprise Applications Consulting. "But if you don't want your company to pay taxes" -- Salesforce paid no tax, legally, on billions in corporate income -- "what right do you have to lecture people on how to make the world better?"
And if your company is faltering, Mr. Greenbaum said, you have even less right. Mr. Benioff posted more than 30 times on Twitter in January about his initiative to restock the world's forests, a cause he was promoting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. There were no tweets acknowledging Salesforce's turmoil.
"Marc has let the cash cow meander out into the weeds," Mr. Greenbaum said.
That is the logic behind the stakes taken by the activist investors, which also include Third Point, Inclusive Capital and ValueAct Capital. Maybe Mr. Benioff can be compelled to bring the cow home faster, or he can step down in favor of someone who will. None of the activists would comment, but Mr. Benioff would.
"I'm as excited about our future as all our investors are -- I'm a stockholder too!" he texted, adding a heart emoji.
Salesforce shares have rebounded since the layoffs were announced. But to fend off the activists and extend his reign, Mr. Benioff needs to improve profit margins. That quest is likely to prompt more stress in the Salesforce family, perhaps even more layoffs. Which means Thich Nhat Hanh's question still hangs there -- success or happiness?
"What do I really want? The answer is trust," Mr. Benioff said. "Trust from our employees, trust from our customers."
This is, of course, a salesman's answer. From Marc Benioff, would you expect any different?

Then came 2022. Suddenly Salesforce made less money. The stock wilted. An activist investor, Starboard Value, bought a stake, never good news for management. Benioff’s co-CEO, Bret Taylor, abruptly departed after only a year in the job. He was the second co-CEO to do so, leaving the question of succession to Benioff’s 24-year reign at the company in doubt.
Last month, Salesforce said it would lay off 10% of its staff, a decision that seemed to go against Benioff’s repeated declarations that the company was one big family. He was chastised on social media for handling the cuts poorly. A second activist investor, Elliott Management, bought a stake in Salesforce. Then another and another and another. For those keeping count, that’s five.
“Marc believes you can have a great company, give great returns to your shareholders and help your community and your planet, all at the same time,” said Steve Fisher, a longtime Salesforce employee who was also a teenage friend of Benioff’s. “This is one of the times when that notion is being tested.”
Salesforce’s troubles, like those of many of its tech peers in this moment of turmoil, spring from the pandemic. Three years ago, it looked as if technology might save humanity. For tens of millions of people, tech was suddenly the interface between their couch and their job.
“In the darkest depths of the pandemic, I was like, ‘How will we ever get out of this?,’” Benioff said in one of a series of conversations with The New York Times over the past week. Maybe, he thought, we would not. “I felt we were going to be pivoting much more aggressively to an all-digital day.”
Salesforce’s big pandemic purchase, announced in late 2020, was the remote-work app Slack for $28 billion. If everyone was going to stay on Slack all day long forever, it was cheap at that price. But they didn’t, and it wasn’t.
The troubles at Salesforce may be more wide ranging, but they are mirrored all over the tech industry. About 100,000 tech workers have been laid off since the beginning of the year, according to Layoffs.fyi. That’s a rounding error for the larger economy, but these workers were until recently among the best paid and best treated. The notion that free massages, say, might no longer be part of the Silicon Valley experience was yet more evidence that tech was losing its pandemic grip.
Salesforce never offered massages, but its corporate philosophy promotes the idea that its workers are special. A word Benioff tosses around a lot is “Ohana,” which he picked up in Hawaii. “Ohana represents the idea that families — blood-related, adopted or intentional — are bound together, and that family members are responsible for one another,” Salesforce’s website says.
Benioff sees no contradiction between layoffs and the Salesforce Ohana. Families are sometimes difficult.
“I wish I offered lifetime employment,” he said. “But the reality is when you have a big company with 80,000 employees, there are going to be times you have to make a head-count adjustment. Our layoff packages are some of the most generous ever.” The dismissed employees got a minimum of nearly five months’ pay.
It may have come as a shock to some, he added, but layoffs at Salesforce are nothing new.
“There’s been some hard times since we began in 1999,” he said. “It’s not all up and to the right. But this is the opportunity for growth. If you’re in a steady state, you don’t grow.”
A random sampling of laid-off Salesforce employees contacted through employment sites yielded few who wanted to complain about Benioff, even anonymously. “I think he got lost somewhere, had too many sycophants telling him what he wanted to hear,” one offered. That was as savage as it got.
Benioff, though, had lots to say, often by text — sometimes words but also photos, links and emoji. His mother, Joelle, said in an interview that he was “not a big talker” as a child but now has words to spare. At a virtual company meeting after last month’s layoffs, he talked for two hours.
Bad idea, he says now.
“We were trying to explain the unexplainable,” Benioff said. “It’s hard to have a call like that with such a large group and have it be effective, and we paid a price.” Other tech companies didn’t bother with hand holding: They just cut off their former employees’ access in the middle of the night.
It was a rough month at Salesforce. Benioff went to one of his favorite places, French Polynesia, for a 10-day digital detox.
“We are so addicted to our devices (at least I am) it’s very freeing to leave them all behind for a while!” he wrote in a text.
On an earlier trip, he had contributed $1 million in cash to local pandemic relief. For these and other services to the French, he is now a Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur. He made his family listen to the speech.
Any conversation with Benioff inevitably touches on his grandfather Marvin E. Lewis, a San Francisco trial lawyer and politician who was a major force behind BART, the regional transit system.
Lewis was best known for developing the concept of “psychic injury.” His most famous case, in 1970, was called “The Cable Car Named Desire.” A dancer, Gloria Sykes, said she had hit her head in a cable car accident, lost her “mental balance” and developed “an insatiable appetite for sex” as well as other problems, including at least one suicide attempt. With Lewis as her lawyer, Sykes was awarded $50,000 by a jury.
“He was truly a visionary,” Benioff said. “He was in business as a lawyer but made the world a better place.” He texted a photo of a tribute to Lewis in a BART station that calls him “a determined prophet.”
If a lawyer can scale these heights, why not a tech executive? Especially if he can make himself happy in the process?
“You’re not going to be happy if you’re not giving to others,” Benioff said. “A lot of my tech peers are extremely unhappy.”
Salesforce and Benioff have undoubtedly made major contributions to the well-being of San Francisco. But more questions are being asked these days about the inherent contradictions of working for the powerful to aid the powerless. As a reviewer on Amazon wrote of Benioff’s book “Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change”: “Benioff often seems surprised at the scale of the problems in the world, despite many of his customers playing a part in them.”
“Marc makes himself a target for criticism by positioning himself as much more than a rampant capitalist tech bro,” said Joshua Greenbaum, a software industry analyst with Enterprise Applications Consulting. “But if you don’t want your company to pay taxes” — Salesforce paid no tax, legally, on billions in corporate income — “what right do you have to lecture people on how to make the world better?”
And if your company is faltering, Greenbaum said, you have even less right. Benioff posted more than 30 times on Twitter in January about his initiative to restock the world’s forests, a cause he was promoting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. There were no tweets acknowledging Salesforce’s turmoil.
“Marc has let the cash cow meander out into the weeds,” Greenbaum said.
That is the logic behind the stakes taken by the activist investors, which also include Third Point, Inclusive Capital and ValueAct Capital. Maybe Benioff can be compelled to bring the cow home faster, or he can step down in favor of someone who will. None of the activists would comment, but Benioff would.
“I’m as excited about our future as all our investors are — I’m a stockholder too!” he texted, adding a heart emoji.
Salesforce shares have rebounded since the layoffs were announced. But to fend off the activists and extend his reign, Benioff needs to improve profit margins. That quest is likely to prompt more stress in the Salesforce family, perhaps even more layoffs. Which means Thich Nhat Hanh’s question still hangs there — success or happiness?
“What do I really want? The answer is trust,” Benioff said. “Trust from our employees, trust from our customers.”
This is, of course, a salesperson’s answer. From Benioff, would you expect any different? This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: At tech companies that spent recent years expanding paid parental leave, parents have felt the whiplash of mass layoffs in an especially visceral way.
Alex Gable spent recent weeks in the bleary-eyed haze of new parenthood. His son was born in November and Mr. Gable powered down his laptop, deleted Slack from his phone and focused on caring for his wife while making the most of the four precious hours a day that their baby was awake -- there was tummy time and time spent ogling little drawings of snowflakes.
Then on Jan. 18, Mr. Gable got an early morning notification for an all-hands meeting at Coda, the software company where he worked as a data scientist. Four hours later Mr. Gable, 30, found himself having to deliver the news to his wife: He had been laid off while on paternity leave -- months after choosing the company for its generous paternity leave policy and openness toward work-life balance.
"It's like an earthquake," he said. "It's the weight of 'What am I going to bring him up with? How is his first year going to go? How are you going to make ends meet?"'
Workers across the tech and media industries are experiencing a period of immense whiplash. After lavishing their employees with perks, in a tight labor market and a war for talent, companies have turned to mass job cuts, including Alphabet, which laid off 6 percent of its workers last month, and Microsoft, which cut nearly 5 percent.
These are the same companies that spent recent years expanding benefits in one area in particular: paid parental leave and caregiver benefits, which fill in the gaps for white-collar workers in a country where the federal government does not require employers to offer paid parental leave. Which means that working parents have felt the turbulence of mass layoffs in an especially visceral way.
Now some are spending their early weeks of parenthood adjusting to life without a job. LinkedIn and Twitter have been filled with accounts of workers being laid off while on parental leave or even, in at least two instances, while delivering a baby. That comes with a mental health toll -- as so many laid-off workers across different backgrounds have experienced, including those who are immigrants with visas tied to employment.
Employees across tech have felt that their companies engaged in a bait and switch, after selling not just a job but a lifestyle, with child care, mental health support and plentiful paid time off. For new parents, generous leave was part of the draw. Many had assumed that their parental leave came with some legal protection, and were distraught to learn they were caught up in mass job cuts. Being on parental leave does not protect someone from mass layoffs unrelated to their leave.
America has no federal paid-family-leave policy. About 23 percent of private employees have paid maternity leave, according to September 2022 data from the career site Zippia. More than 90 percent of women take the full amount of leave offered, compared with about two-thirds of men, according to a survey by the Boston College Center for Work and Family.
But in the last five years, companies scaled up family-friendly benefits for some workers in what human resources experts called the "golden age" of corporate benefits. A study from Mercer found that 54 percent of large companies covered in vitro fertilization in 2022, compared with 36 percent in 2015, and 19 percent covered egg freezing compared with 6 percent in 2015.
Tech companies were especially generous on parental leave compared with other industries. Google increased its parental leave to 24 weeks from 18 in 2021, Meta offers parents 20 weeks, and Microsoft gave 20 weeks for birthing parents and 12 weeks for nonbirthing parents. California, too, increased parental leave benefits to eight weeks from six. ZipRecruiter found that 849 out of 100,000 job postings offered paid parental leave in 2022, up from 95 out of 100,000 in 2017.
This expansion of family-friendly benefits was partly a bid for female talent, as historically male-dominated workplaces made commitments to bringing in more women. It also reflected a cultural shift, as a new generation of workers, across genders, made it clear they wanted the flexibility to play an active role in child care, according to Joan Williams, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.
"There's a sizable portion of young men who would be bent out of shape if they couldn't take family leave," Ms. Williams said. "Tech companies realized they could try to steal talent by having the best set of family leave policies around."
With these new perks also came an uptick in the share of men taking paternity leave. In 2011, fewer than 5 percent of new fathers took more than two weeks of paternity leave. Today, 90 percent of men take more than seven weeks of leave if they are offered eight weeks, according to the Boston College Center for Work and Family. Some managers started proactively asking male workers how they planned to use their leave time, leaving behind the culture of assuming that fathers would take off only a few days.
People on parental leave typically have no special legal protection when it comes to mass layoffs. Many workers have a legal right to take parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law, or similar state laws. But being on leave, including for disability, doesn't usually protect people from job cuts that would have happened anyway.
"It's jarring because people do view it as job-protected leave without understanding that there are limits on the protection," said Megan Bisk, head of the employment law practice at Ropes & Gray. "Many people view it as a time when they're not in a position to be job searching."
If workers were laid off because they were on parental leave, that would be illegal -- but it would be difficult to prove, Ms. Bisk explained, because the criteria companies use for layoffs aren't disclosed to laid-off workers.
Emily St. James, 42, who was a senior correspondent at Vox, had been up late feeding her newborn the day before Vox Media announced its mass layoffs last month, so she slept in until 9 a.m. on the West Coast. She woke up to a text from Vox's publisher, then checked her email and saw that she had been laid off. Ms. St. James's termination date was set as the last day of her maternity leave, which is in late March, and she will get 24 weeks of severance pay beyond that.
"When it happened I think my wife said, 'Well, isn't that illegal?"' Ms. St. James recalled. "This has underscored for me the degree to which the social safety net for people who are new parents is very frayed."
Vox declined to comment for this article.
The lack of legal guidelines has resulted in a patchwork of policies among companies. For those laid off while on parental leave, Amazon is offering to pay out the remainder of their time off, as well as severance packages. Meta and Google, on the other hand, aren't paying for any remaining parental leave but are offering all employees several months of pay and additional severance.
Several workers who were laid off while on parental leave declined to speak for this article, citing fears of retribution because their severance packages are tied to agreements that they won't speak to the media.
Niki Woodall, who was an engineering leadership recruiter at one of the world's largest tech companies, agreed to share her experience without naming her employer. She had been at the company for five years when she told her bosses that she planned to take six months of maternity leave starting last summer. Their family-friendly attitude gave her the confidence to completely unplug from work. She said she left without thinking: "My job is at stake."
A month before she was set to return, she received a personal email letting her know that her job was being eliminated. She turned to her 4-month-old daughter, who was sitting beside the family cat, Wesa, and said, "Mommy lost her job."
"There's a big misperception that you can't be let go during maternity leave," said Ms. Woodall, 39. She was disappointed to lose her job but not surprised because the layoffs hit many fellow recruiters.
Other parents who lost their jobs said they wondered whether their absence from the office contributed to executives' deciding their position was redundant.
Some parental leave experts worry that fear of future layoffs could deter new fathers from taking their leave. As Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family, put it: "This will have a sobering effect."
Mr. Gable had a previous layoff experience, from Zillow, in 2021 -- at the height of the pandemic's white hot job market. The career opportunities felt endless -- including many at companies with generous policies toward parents. He chose Coda because he sensed that managers there were supportive of workers taking time for their families. As he prepares to apply for tech jobs yet again, his options feel far more limited.
"Its weird to have that pulled out from under you," he said. "The market conditions are basically the opposite right now."

Bernie Sanders Has a New Role. It Could Be His Final Act in Washington.

WASHINGTON — In two unsuccessful bids for the White House, Sen. Bernie Sanders made no secret of his disdain for billionaires. Now, in what could be his final act in Washington, he has the power to summon them to testify before Congress — and he has a few corporate executives in his sights.
One is Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, who Sanders complains “has become a multibillionaire” by developing a coronavirus vaccine with government money. “I think Mr. Bancel should be talking to his advisers about what he might say to the United States Senate,” Sanders warned in an interview.
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Howard Schultz, the on-and-off CEO of Starbucks, are also on his list. He views them as union busters whose companies have resorted to “really vicious and illegal” tactics to keep workers from organizing. He has already demanded that Schultz testify at a hearing in March.
Sanders, I-Vt., can put these men on the spot because he is the new chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. The job gives him sweeping jurisdiction over issues that have animated his rise in politics, such as access to health care, the high cost of prescription drugs and workers’ rights.
Sanders, 81, who identifies as a democratic socialist, has said he will not seek the Democratic nomination for president again if President Joe Biden runs for reelection — a position he reiterated in a recent interview in his Senate office. He is himself up for reelection in 2024 and would not say whether he would run again, which raises the prospect that the next two years in Congress could be his last.
Sanders is clearly operating on two tracks. Last week, in a move that might surprise critics who view him as unbending, he partnered with a Republican, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, to call on rail companies to offer seven days of paid sick leave to their workers — a provision that the Senate defeated last year when it passed legislation to avert a rail strike.
But he also sent a curt letter to Schultz, giving him until Tuesday to respond confirming his attendance at the hearing. That followed an earlier, angry letter in which Sanders urged the Starbucks chief to “immediately halt your aggressive and illegal union busting campaign.” A Starbucks spokesperson said the company was considering the request for Schultz to testify and was working to “offer clarifying information” about its labor practices.
Former Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat who served as majority leader, said that Sanders could “bring a balance between the progressive and the pragmatic.”
“He will be progressive; he will be aspirational; he will continue to fight the fight,” Daschle said. “But at the same time, I believe Bernie Sanders wants to get things done.”
The chairmanship is the latest turn in Sanders’ long career in politics, a coda to his rise from a left-wing socialist curiosity to a national figure with respect, power and a devoted fan base. After three decades in Washington, he still manages to cast himself as an outsider. And while he may never ascend to the presidency, there is no question that he has left his mark on national politics, reviving and strengthening the American left.
But Sanders’ national following cuts both ways. He is both a darling of the progressive movement and fodder for conservatives, who are already gleefully caricaturing him.
“Medicare for All, baby!” crowed Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist, referring to Sanders’ signature legislative initiative, a government-run health care program for all Americans. “I guarantee you Bernie Sanders will provide a wonderful target for Republicans to shoot at.”
He already has. Sanders’ rise has put him in the ranks of the very wealthy Americans he criticizes, in part thanks to a book he wrote, “Our Revolution,” in the wake of his first bid for the presidency. (“If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too,” he said in 2019.)
He is about to go on tour to hawk a new book, “It’s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism,” due out later this month and billed by its publisher as “a progressive takedown of the über-capitalist status quo.” Tickets for an upcoming book event at a concert venue in Washington are selling for up to $95 on Ticketmaster — a company that last month was accused of anti-competitive behavior by some of Sanders’ Senate colleagues. His Republican critics are having a field day with that.
“Anyone else see the ‘irony’ in Bernie Sanders selling tickets for his ‘It’s Okay to Be Angry About Capitalism’ book tour on Ticketmaster?” Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., wrote on Twitter.
A spokesperson for Sanders said the senator was not involved in selecting the venue or setting ticket prices.
With Republicans running the House and 60 votes needed to pass most bills in the Senate, Sanders has little hope of pushing major legislation through Congress. He intends to introduce a Medicare for All bill, as he has done in past Congresses, because he feels “it’s important to keep that issue out there,” as he put it. But he is well aware that it is going nowhere on Capitol Hill.
“We don’t have the votes,” he said matter-of-factly. “We have no Republican support for it. And I would guess, you know, we have maybe half of Democrats who might support it.”
That is Sanders the realist speaking, in a tone far more practical than the one he has used during his campaign rallies and familiar rants against millionaires and billionaires. But those who watch Sanders closely know that, while he has never been a master legislator in the mold of former Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a predecessor of his as the health committee chair, he is able to work across the aisle.
In 2014, as chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Sanders partnered with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on a major overhaul of the veterans’ health care system — a measure that the Vermont senator described then as “not the bill that I would have written” but nonetheless “a significant step forward.”
A copy of the bill hangs on the wall of his office, alongside a photograph of President Barack Obama signing it, with Sanders looking over his shoulder and doing something he is not often seen doing in the Capitol: smiling.
Sanders’ activist roots run deep, but after arriving in Washington in 1991 as Vermont’s lone member of the House, he quickly learned that being an outsider would only get him so far; he would have to deal with Democrats if he wanted any power. In the Senate, which he joined in 2007, he has worked his way up the ranks. In addition to leading the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, he has also served as chair of the Budget Committee.
No one — perhaps not even Sanders himself — could have predicted then that he would wage two credible runs for the Democratic nomination for president. In the interview, Sanders brushed aside questions of politics. He wanted to talk policy.
“We spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of other industrialized nations, and yet we have 85 million who are uninsured or underinsured,” he said, adding, “So you have a system that is not working.
“It’s propped up by the power of the insurance companies, some drug companies,” he continued, “and I will do my best to change it.”
Sanders wants to hear from Moderna, he said, about the company’s plan to sharply hike the price of its coronavirus vaccine. In a recent letter to Bancel, he assailed the vaccine maker for “unacceptable corporate greed” and urged the company to reconsider.
A spokesperson for Moderna said the company had always “been willing to engage in conversation with government stakeholders” and would continue to do so.
At the hearing in March, Sanders wants Schultz to explain why Starbucks has drawn scrutiny from the National Labor Relations Board. The board has been investigating Starbucks for various allegations of misconduct, including that it had illegally denied raises to union employees and had fired seven workers at a store in Memphis, Tennessee, for their union-organizing activity. A court later ordered Starbucks to reinstate those workers.
The health committee also has some must-pass legislation on its agenda, including the reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, a 2006 law intended to improve public health and medical preparedness for emergencies, including acts of bioterrorism. The law was reauthorized in 2013 and must be reauthorized this year.
Joel White, a Republican strategist who specializes in health policy, said Sanders might be more bipartisan than some of his critics expect, adding, “I think Bernie probably wouldn’t have become chair of the health committee just to throw bombs.”
Two Republicans on the panel, Braun and Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, both said in interviews that they thought they might find common ground with Sanders on matters like lowering the cost of prescription drugs and supporting community health centers.
And Daschle said Sanders had a counterpart he could probably work with: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the top Republican on the committee. A physician who helped found a community health clinic to treat the uninsured, Cassidy was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict former President Donald Trump at his second impeachment trial.
As committee chair, Sanders said he intended to “take the show on the road” by having hearings in places other than Washington so he could hear from ordinary Americans, such as older people who have a hard time paying for prescription drugs, working families struggling to pay for child care and students who cannot afford to pay for college.
With the recent retirement of Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat who served for 48 years, Sanders is finally the senior senator from Vermont. Asked how he felt, he said, “pretty good.” Then, ever combative, he shot back, “How do you feel?”
He said people who wonder about whether he will run again — and by people, he meant reporters — should “keep wondering.”
Why? “Because I’ve just told you, and this is very serious,” he said, wearing his trademark scowl. “If you think about my record, I take this job seriously. The purpose of elections is to elect people to do work, not to keep talking about elections.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Scrolling past ads has rarely been enjoyable. But in recent months, people say the experience seems so much worse.
Portia Kapraun has always seen unwelcome ads on Twitter, usually from major brands pitching her luxury jewelry or vehicles that she, as a librarian in Indiana, could not afford.
But the mix now is far more annoying: More ads for random gold investments, she said, and also a badly designed ad for what looked like a tabletop foosball set constructed with rubber bands and particle board, which promised its product would be the most fun family game she had ever played.
Ms. Kapraun was not interested. But she soon saw the ad again. And again. And again.
"I don't know who they think I am, but that did not look especially fun," she said of the foosball set. "These feel like bargain basement advertisers. It mostly seemed like things you would see if you were watching late-night television."
In a shaky advertising market in an uncertain economy, ads that few people want to see suddenly seem to be everywhere.
Recent ads on Twitter, as described by users, have made the platform feel like a tabloid magazine or the haunting ground of Ron Popeil, the inventor of wares people didn't know they needed including the Veg-O-Matic, the Ronco Electric Food Dehydrator and the Inside-the-Shell Egg Scrambler. There were ads for T-shirts printed with a horse's head superimposed on a heartbeat line, served to someone who does not ride horses nor particularly like them. Also: fraudulent ads for discount drones, spots hawking crude gaming apps and promoted posts from people ranting about "puppet masters" and "the slave mind."
On Instagram, ads from Amazon promote unrecognizable contraptions from obscure merchants, echoing the shopping site Wish, which was notorious for bizarre ads. On YouTube, ads impersonate popular video creators to scam viewers, a phenomenon that has irked Elon Musk and that YouTube says it is addressing.
Advancements in digital advertising technology were meant to improve users' experience. People interested in shoes are intended to get ads for sneakers and loafers, and not repeated pitches for courses teaching seduction techniques. And the technology is supposed to filter out misleading or dangerous pitches.
But lately, on several platforms, the opposite seems to be happening for a variety of reasons, including a slowdown in the overall digital ad market. As numerous deep-pocketed marketers have pulled back, and the softer market has led several digital platforms to lower their ad pricing, opportunities have opened up for less exacting advertisers.
"Anytime you lower the barrier to entry, you're going to get lower-quality entrants," said Jessica Fong, an assistant marketing professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
In the past, buying a newspaper or television ad usually involved calling up a representative who would manually review and place the ad. Now, more than 90 percent of spending on digital display ads happens through automated software.
Social media offers many ad formats -- static text, videos, playable games, messaging, brand takeovers, custom filters -- and most are getting easier to buy. Many advertisers can now go online and set the budget for how much they are willing to bid through a platform's automated auction for a spot that reaches their target audience.
Evidence of a junk-ad epidemic is anecdotal; tech platforms rarely reveal data on who advertises with them and how often. Also, quality is in the eye of the beholder -- plenty of people willingly click on male enhancement ads, and ads are sometimes most successful when they are eye-catchingly terrible.
Social media platforms have said they have established rigorous advertising policies to safeguard standards and continue to attract first-rate ads from blue-chip companies.
But advertising experts agree that crummy ads -- some just irritating, others malicious -- appear to be proliferating. They point to a variety of potential causes: internal turmoil at tech companies, weak content moderation and higher-tier advertisers exploring alternatives. In addition, privacy changes by Apple and other tech companies have affected the availability of users' data and advertisers' ability to track it to better tailor their ads.
Then, there's the economy: A survey of 43 multinational companies representing more than $ 44 billion in advertising spending, conducted last fall by the World Federation of Advertisers, found that nearly 30 percent planned to shrink their marketing budgets this year. Clorox, which budgets hundreds of millions of dollars a year to advertising and promoting products like Burt's Bees lotions, Brita filters and Pine-Sol cleaners, said this month that it was beginning to streamline its marketing, which included cutting back on spending.
Digital ad spending, while still growing overall, "has decelerated precipitously," according to an analysis last month by the research firm Insider Intelligence.
Twitter seems to be faring the worst. The company has struggled to retain top-flight advertisers since Mr. Musk took over as owner in October, amid fears of a proliferation of hate speech and misinformation on the platform. Its 10 largest advertisers last year spent 55 percent less during Mr. Musk's tenure than they did a year earlier, with six of them spending nothing so far in 2023, according to estimates from the research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter has offered buy-one-get-one-free deals, discounts and bonus incentives to lure back advertisers, media buyers said.
But advertising troubles have hit the biggest publicly traded social networks, too. Snapchat's parent company last month posted its slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth and projected a sales drop for the current quarter. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said ad sales at YouTube slipped nearly 8 percent in the latest quarter.
Last year, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, reported its first decline ever in quarterly revenue (it fell again last quarter). Ad prices on Facebook and Instagram fell 24 percent in the last quarter of 2022 from a year earlier, according to the investment bank Piper Sandler.
Shareholder pressure, stoked by years of big profits, continues to push those companies to generate revenue wherever possible -- including, experts said, through selling low-quality ads.
Corey Richardson, vice president at the multicultural ad agency Fluent360 in Chicago, said he was seeing more ads for items in which he had no interest -- Hawaiian shirts featuring "Star Wars" characters, a fountain shaped like hands folded in the prayer position, all mixed in with vaccine misinformation and the occasional video depicting violence.
"They're just taking whatever money comes -- beggars can't be choosers," Mr. Richardson said.
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment. YouTube said it invested "significantly" in ad quality and consumer experience.
Other factors are also contributing to lower ad quality, Mr. Richardson said. Social media advertising, once a niche art practiced by specialist agencies, is now easily available to anyone. Many of them are eschewing targeted ads -- placements intended to reach specific audiences, usually at a higher cost -- in favor of a cheaper spray-and-pray approach online, hoping to catch the attention of gullible or bored shoppers.
Major social media platforms are now "like the mall in your hometown that used to be the good mall," Mr. Richardson said: "But now there's no longer a Macy's there -- it's just a calendar store and a place selling beepers."
The ads are also increasingly inescapable. Twitter recently revoked free access for third-party services like Tweetbot and Twitterific, which helped many users avoid unwanted ads. A project that blocked YouTube ads was forced to shut down in March; months later, YouTube said it concluded a small experiment that tried to reduce ad breaks by moving more ads into fewer interruptions, sometimes showing viewers as many as 10 unskippable ads in a row. In the fall, a survey by Insider Intelligence found that 52 percent of Facebook users reported seeing more ads on the platform, compared with nearly half of YouTube and Instagram users.
Meta allows users to personalize their ad experience, changing their preferences when they see an ad they are uninterested in. The company has also said it does not approve ads about subjects like climate change that its fact-checking partners have categorized as false, and it takes down ads that violate its policies.
In the past year, researchers and journalists on Facebook have discovered ads for dangerous or illegal dietary supplements; dozens of since-removed ads showing photoshopped images of the Australian prime minister that linked to investment scams; and allegedly misleading advertising timed to the COP27 climate summit. After being contacted by The New York Times, Meta took down Instagram ads that ply cancer patients with polished pseudoscience promoting vague but expensive alternative treatments.
YouTube said it prohibited ads that impersonate businesses, swindle users or employ clickbait tactics. The company said it blocked or removed more than 3.4 billion ads and suspended more than 5.6 million advertiser accounts in 2021.
"Though there are always bad actors looking to bypass enforcement systems across all tech platforms, we remain vigilant in trying to identify and remove them as quickly as we can," YouTube said in a statement.
Beyond social platforms, bad ads appear elsewhere on the internet. But streaming services and news websites tend to have stricter advertising guidelines and more limited and expensive ad space, which makes ads easier to regulate. Some publishers, like Bloomberg Media, are starting to avoid third-party brokers and automated auctions of ad space, which deal with enormous volumes and are more likely to miss low-quality ads.
Social media is a far easier target for the small but motivated group of anti-vaccine advertisers studied by David A. Broniatowski, who helps run the Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics at the George Washington University. Their ads are designed to evade "very brittle" moderation algorithms by spacing out the letters of banned keywords or replacing them with emojis, he said.
"They will use whatever means necessary to get their message out there," he said. "Ads are simply one tool in their toolbox."

The Redstone Family Drama: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On Sunday, May 13, 2018, Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, faced a difficult decision, perhaps the most agonizing of his long and celebrated media career: whether to pull the trigger on a coup against the Redstone family, which controlled CBS.
"This is NUCLEAR," Mr. Moonves wrote that afternoon to Bruce S. Gordon, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. and a close confidant on the network's board.
The philandering and increasingly infirm 94-year-old Sumner Redstone, the patriarch who assembled CBS, the Paramount film studio and a bevy of cable networks under the Viacom umbrella into a multibillion-dollar media and entertainment empire, had let Mr. Moonves run CBS as he saw fit.
But now Shari Redstone, Mr. Redstone's daughter, was solidifying her hold. She had managed to separate her father from the growing influence of his two live-in companions, one purportedly his fiancée, with a nine-carat diamond to prove it. Ms. Redstone had recently stocked the Viacom board with her allies, who had then replaced the company's long-serving chief executive with her choice for the job -- something that Mr. Moonves feared would soon happen at CBS.
After Mr. Redstone divided his empire into two publicly traded but Redstone-controlled companies -- CBS and Viacom -- in 2006, Mr. Moonves had led CBS out of last place in the ratings and made it the most consistently watched broadcast network. But now Ms. Redstone wanted to merge the much healthier CBS with a floundering Viacom, and was consulting with Mr. Moonves -- meddling, in his view -- on a regular basis.
As Mr. Moonves had implored one board director: "Help me here. Shari is driving me crazy."
He showed no sign of this to Ms. Redstone, with whom he continued to discuss the merger. But while she thought he was open to her ideas, Mr. Moonves and his supporters on the CBS board had secretly plotted a board vote to strip the Redstones of their voting control and block the merger. Then CBS would immediately sue in Delaware to prevent Ms. Redstone, her father and the family trust that controlled their assets from replacing CBS board members or otherwise nullifying the board's action. This was the "nuclear" option -- a legal gambit with profound implications for every public company with a controlling shareholder, which includes many of the biggest media and tech companies.
"After filing there can't be a deal," Mr. Moonves continued in his message to Mr. Gordon. Referring to Ms. Redstone: "She won't be manageable."
"She's not manageable now," Mr. Gordon responded.
Today Shari Redstone ranks among the most powerful executives in Hollywood. As nonexecutive chair she oversees Paramount Global, the company that emerged from the combination of CBS and Viacom, home to such hits as last summer's "Top Gun: Maverick" and the current streaming series "Yellowstone."
Mr. Moonves, by contrast, was fired from CBS after more than a dozen women, including his own doctor, accused him of sexual misconduct; was denied $ 120 million in severance payments; and retreated in disgrace to his homes in Beverly Hills and Malibu, Calif. Initially a reluctant participant in her father's business empire, intimidated by the big names attending the annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, Ms. Redstone not only survived the "nuclear" option but emerged on top.
A trove of documents and testimony helps explain how she did it -- in part through her own "mettle," as her father might have put it, and in part thanks to some startling revelations that Mr. Moonves did his best to conceal from a board of directors who showed little interest in thoroughly investigating his past.
This account is drawn from our forthcoming book, "Unscripted: The Epic Battle for a Media Empire and the Redstone Family Legacy," and based on scores of interviews with participants conducted over three years. Many were on a not-for-attribution basis because of litigation and nondisclosure agreements. We reviewed numerous texts and emails exchanged among Mr. Moonves, CBS executives and board members, including those quoted above.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Moonves declined to comment. Ms. Redstone responded to questions either directly or through a spokesperson, and participated in fact-checking.
'Does not have the requisite business judgment'
That Ms. Redstone would ever be in a position to challenge Mr. Moonves -- or any of her father's other handpicked male executives -- once seemed unfathomable to anyone who knew the family's dynamic. The irascible Mr. Redstone had belittled and marginalized his daughter (and had driven his son, Brent, to abandon the business and family entirely and retreat to a Colorado ranch).
Mr. Redstone had long disparaged his daughter to Viacom executives, board members -- practically anyone who would listen. He pelted her with profanity-laced emails and faxes, according to several former Viacom executives who were copied on the missives. When his longtime lawyer and confidant, George Abrams, among those who saw the messages, begged Mr. Redstone not to use such hurtful language, he erupted, insisting he'd call his daughter whatever he pleased.
By 2007, father and daughter were barely speaking, communicating through faxes and lawyers. Fissures within the family were so widely known within CBS that employees would joke that the Redstones gave each other subpoenas for Christmas.
In a letter to trustees of his family trust that year, Mr. Redstone stated bluntly that "Ms. Redstone does not have the requisite business judgment and abilities to serve as chairman."
He took his disparaging views public in a letter to Forbes that July: "While my daughter talks of good governance, she apparently ignores the cardinal rule of good governance that the boards of the two public companies, Viacom and CBS, should select my successor."
'If there are any stories out there, we need to know'
When he was healthy, Mr. Redstone seemed certain that his daughter should not succeed him. That all appeared to change as his health, ability to speak and mental capacity deteriorated, especially after he ejected his romantic companions from his Beverly Hills mansion.
Over time, he increasingly depended on his daughter for his care and to interpret his wishes. Ms. Redstone emerged as his heir apparent, a powerful executive in her own right and the de facto chairman of her father's companies. This was the situation deemed intolerable by Mr. Moonves and his allies.
As the CBS board contemplated the "nuclear" option in early 2018, Mr. Moonves was well aware that far more was at stake than just the Redstone family's corporate control.
After articles in The New York Times and The New Yorker about Harvey Weinstein's serial abuse of women ushered in the #MeToo era, which encouraged sexual assault victims to speak publicly, rumors began circulating that Mr. Moonves would soon be another major media executive to be felled by accusations of misconduct. Ms. Redstone heard those rumors, too.
"There is a lot of noise here at CES," she emailed another board member, referring to the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2018.
According to another widespread rumor, Ronan Farrow, who had written the Weinstein exposé for The New Yorker, was at work on an article about Mr. Moonves.
Not all CBS directors were eager to get to the bottom of the rumors, but after Ms. Redstone's prodding, they hired Michael Aiello, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges, to interview Mr. Moonves about any potential accusations that could become public. Little did Ms. Redstone realize that her own future would turn on revelations about Mr. Moonves's past sexual misconduct.
"If there are any stories out there, we need to know," Mr. Aiello began a call with Mr. Moonves on Jan. 16, 2018, according to a lawyer's notes of the interview that were reviewed by The Times.
Mr. Moonves said there were two instances of possible concern, both decades in the past, long before his employment by CBS.
In the first, a young actress had come in for a meeting when he was at Warner Bros. He didn't know her. He said that he had exposed himself and that she "ran out of room," according to the notes.
"Let me take a step back," Mr. Aiello said. "What does 'exposed' mean?"
This time, Mr. Moonves said they had engaged in consensual oral sex. Afterward, he heard from her manager that the actress was "upset." The manager said that he had gotten calls from The Times, and that there was "buzz" about what had happened.
The second incident, Mr. Moonves said, involved a female television executive who had recently filed a police complaint against him for sexual assault. But the incident dated to the 1980s, and the statute of limitations had expired long ago, which would prevent any charges. In any event, he said, the sex was consensual.
That was pretty much the end of the investigation. No one asked Mr. Moonves the names of the women, let alone tried to hear their accounts.
Mr. Aiello assured the board that while there had been times when Mr. Moonves might have been "clumsy" and made "unwanted advances," there was nothing to worry about. Asked by one director for details about any incidents, Mr. Aiello seemed squeamish. He said that the board "didn't want to know" and that he "didn't want to go there."
Mr. Aiello declined comment for the book and didn't respond to requests for comment on this article.
Later that month, Ms. Redstone had lunch alone with Mr. Moonves at his office in Los Angeles. She laid out her long-term plans -- CBS and Viacom would merge and then be in a stronger position to compete or be acquired by another company. As she had said before, she didn't want to be a media mogul -- she was looking forward to focusing on her family and her other ventures. Was Mr. Moonves on board?
He said he was.
Mr. Moonves, she said, was essential to the plan. There was also the delicate issue of the #MeToo rumors. Ms. Redstone asked Mr. Moonves if there was any truth to them.
He told her to look him in the eyes. He assured her there was nothing to be concerned about.
'A public war for 6 months'
In May, as the "nuclear" option loomed, Mr. Moonves was clearly worried about Ms. Redstone's concerns. Even if he thought he had done nothing wrong, sexual abuse accusations alone -- should they ever become public -- were potentially ruinous to him and fatal to any lawsuit against the Redstones.
Mr. Moonves anguished over the decision, even trying to back out of the carefully orchestrated attack. In a series of texts produced in the Delaware litigation, he wrote to CBS's head of communications, his close ally Gil Schwartz, on May 13:
"I can't do this. I do not want to file. It will be a public war for 6 months. I am not emotionally prepared for this. I would rather leave. Sorry."
It fell to Bruce Gordon, the board confidant, to coax Mr. Moonves back. Mr. Gordon wasn't entirely surprised that Mr. Moonves was wavering. But he was convinced that a merger was not in the interest of CBS shareholders and had to be stopped.
The CBS board convened by phone that day to consider the attack on the Redstone family. With the meeting in progress, Mr. Gordon texted with Mr. Moonves, alternately sympathizing and cajoling: "I really don't think you want to do this. You are destroying your credibility."
"I am not ready for the fight," Mr. Moonves replied. "I can't do it. 6 months of attacks. No."
Mr. Moonves agonized that if he supported the board vote to dilute the Redstones' voting power and to file the ensuing lawsuit, Ms. Redstone would attack him with all the ammunition she could muster. If he didn't, he'd lose the support of the board members still loyal to him.
"I am sick either way," Mr. Moonves added. "I have never felt worse." He continued, "A public spectacle." Ms. Redstone "wants to run it. Let's let her."
Minutes later, Mr. Gordon texted Mr. Moonves that it was time for him to join the board call.
"I think we will add you on momentarily. You ready?"
Somehow Mr. Gordon had talked him back from the brink. Mr. Moonves had done another about-face and was ready to go ahead.
"Less is more," Mr. Gordon advised him. "Leave us the flexibility to work details this week."
Mr. Moonves joined the board call in progress just after 3 p.m. In minutes of the meeting reviewed by The Times, he said the board members had his full support in its decision to block the merger and sue the Redstones.
The board members on the call essentially had to choose between Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves and believed Mr. Moonves to be essential to the health of the enterprise. It voted unanimously that a merger with Viacom was not in the interest of CBS shareholders except for the Redstones.
The board members voted unanimously to go ahead with the plan.
After the vote, Mr. Gordon checked in with Mr. Moonves.
"You ok?" he texted.
"Yes," Mr. Moonves answered. It was only about 5:40 p.m., but he was already drinking. "On my third vodka and second egg roll. Go time."
As the evening went on, Mr. Moonves was still worrying about Ms. Redstone in texts to Joseph Ianniello, CBS's chief operating officer and a close ally. "She will come after me big time. I know you have my back!!! She threw us under the bus when not under pressure. Now??? Wow ... She will be enraged."
An hour and a half later, Mr. Moonves threw down the gauntlet.
"Mattresses tomorrow am," he texted Mr. Ianniello, in a reference to "The Godfather." "And take the gun. We need it."
The next morning, May 14, Ms. Redstone was at her apartment high in the tower of the Pierre Hotel in New York. Central Park sprawled outside her windows, its landscape a vivid green with spring foliage.
At 9:30 a.m. she received an email saying there would be a special CBS board meeting that Thursday. That was the first that Ms. Redstone had heard about any special board meeting.
She called one of her lawyers, Christopher Austin at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in New York.
"What's this about a board meeting?"
"I'm afraid it's worse than that," Mr. Austin replied. "You've been sued. In Delaware."
"What?"
Mr. Austin outlined the claims: Ms. Redstone was plotting to replace the CBS directors. She had violated her duty to shareholders. Her fellow board members wanted to strip her, her father and her family of their control. As she saw it, they wanted to steal the company her father had built.
Ms. Redstone wandered through the apartment in a daze. She had just decided to drop the merger idea if Mr. Moonves didn't support it. For all their difficulties, she believed she and Mr. Moonves were friends.
At least that's what she had thought.
In Los Angeles it was just after 6:30 a.m., so Ms. Redstone texted Rob Klieger, her lawyer and fellow CBS director.
"I've been sued in Delaware. Call me. They've declared war."
'I am frankly ashamed'
CBS won Round 1 of the court battle, gaining a temporary restraining order preventing the Redstones from rewriting the bylaws or replacing the board members. But a new factor in the continued tenure of Mr. Moonves was looming outside the courtroom.
The rumor that Ronan Farrow was working on a Moonves article for The New Yorker turned out to be true. On July 27, the magazine published an exposé featuring the accounts of six women: "Les Moonves and CBS face allegations of sexual misconduct."
After reading the article, Ms. Redstone could barely contain her anger and frustration. All of it had come as a shock, notwithstanding the months of rumors.
She and Mr. Klieger were astonished that no one from the board or CBS had called them after the article came out. Yet the independent directors, those not aligned with Ms. Redstone and for the most part staunch supporters of Mr. Moonves, had gone ahead without consulting them and issued a public statement saying Mr. Moonves had the board's "full support."
Ms. Redstone fired off a letter to her fellow directors.
"I am frankly ashamed to sit on a board with independent directors who have demonstrated such blind allegiance to senior management and repeatedly failed to act in the best interests of the company, its employees and its shareholders," the letter began. (The letter was reviewed by The Times.)
She was especially critical of the board's previous investigation of the rumors about Mr. Moonves. Mr. Aiello's interview had seemed, to her, perfunctory at best. How could the board have expressed its support for Mr. Moonves when it had done almost nothing to investigate?
"While rumors and allegations are not fact, they do require board action, particularly given the intensity with which they were circulating," she wrote. "The board does not discharge its obligations by asking the C.E.O. if he engaged in any misconduct and taking his word for it when he says he did not."
She added that she had nothing to do with the New Yorker's investigation: "I have never spoken to Ronan Farrow, nor have I spoken with any of the women who have leveled accusations against Les."
'We all did that'
The board convened by phone on Monday morning, July 30, in executive session, which meant Mr. Moonves was excluded. Mr. Klieger and Ms. Redstone participated from offices at Cleary Gottlieb.
By then, sexual misconduct allegations had led to the firing of media celebrities like Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose. CBS itself, like many companies, had issued public statements that such conduct wouldn't be tolerated. Despite this, a cadre of CBS directors had no interest in discussion and had already made up their minds to support Mr. Moonves, according to the accounts of several directors who were at the meeting.
Arnold Kopelson, who won a best-picture Academy Award for producing "Platoon," was especially ardent in his support for Mr. Moonves, dismissing the New Yorker incidents as ancient history. He kept repeating that it was pilot season, when CBS most needed Mr. Moonves's golden touch.
At another point, according to those in the room, he insisted, "We all did that," referring to the allegations against Mr. Moonves. Mr. Kopelson subsequently emailed all his fellow directors: "I don't care if a hundred women come forward. Les is our leader and we have to stand behind him." (Other directors confirmed these remarks; Mr. Kopelson died not long after these events. The Times reviewed a copy of his email to the directors.)
There was also considerable talk about the likely negative reaction on Wall Street if Mr. Moonves was suspended, given that he was closely linked with CBS's success.
The directors didn't have to stay until midnight to resolve their differences. They seemed only too happy to embrace a suggestion from Mr. Klieger, the Redstone lawyer and board member, to wait until they heard from the outside lawyers hired for an independent investigation -- anything to delay removing Mr. Moonves. The meeting adjourned in less than an hour.
Amid intense speculation about Mr. Moonves's fate, CBS issued a statement saying that the board was "in the process of selecting outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation" and that "no other action was taken on this matter at today's board meeting."
Few were satisfied, either on Wall Street or beyond.
But unlike Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer or Charlie Rose, Mr. Moonves had survived.
'Naïveté about what he needs to disclose'
In the wake of the New Yorker article, CBS directors had finally agreed that the company needed an independent investigation. But even then, the warring factions couldn't agree on a firm. So they compromised by hiring lawyers from two different firms -- Mary Jo White, a former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, and Nancy Kestenbaum, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at Covington & Burling.
Their investigation focused less on the instances uncovered by The New Yorker and more on the two that Mr. Moonves disclosed when Mr. Aiello interviewed him the previous year: the actress, Bobbie Phillips, and the television executive, Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb.
Only now did the lawyers learn that more than 20 years after the alleged incident, the actress's manager, Marv Dauer, had been pressuring Mr. Moonves for months to cast Ms. Phillips, and that Mr. Moonves had approached CBS's casting head about the matter. Ms. Phillips had even been offered a part without having to audition or submit a tape.
This revelation came as a bombshell to the lawyers. A 30-year-old allegation of a sexual assault was one thing. But the casting conversation had just happened. It suggested that Mr. Moonves had wanted to cover up the incident, using company resources to silence a potential threat. And he hadn't told them about it.
Ms. White and Ms. Kestenbaum briefed members of the board. They gave an account of an interview they had with Mr. Moonves the previous day, touching on the police report, the actress and the incidents reported in The New Yorker, according to notes of the meeting reviewed by The Times. Ms. Kestenbaum summed up Mr. Moonves's response: "There were times when he would feel an attraction, think it was mutual, make an overture, and if he got rebuffed, he would leave it alone."
Ms. White continued, "Our sense is that whatever occurred, you don't see that after he gets married. Appears to have a 14-year period without this activity. We asked him what else might be out there. He said there was a time when I was dating, there could be something there, but all consensual. He mentioned an encounter with a female doctor, which was rebuffed. Wouldn't give the name or any details."
Then Ms. Kestenbaum mentioned the revelations about the actress and her manager. Mr. Moonves's lawyer "described this scenario as a shakedown," Ms. White said, according to the notes.
"In our view, this raises serious concerns both with respect to candor and forthrightness and the fact that Les took steps with human resources of CBS," Ms. Kestenbaum added.
Ms. White said the "other risk is what I would call naïveté about what he needs to disclose and what is risk," adding, "No one heard about the actress and getting her a job."
She seemed especially concerned that while Mr. Moonves recognized the personal risk -- "his stomach is churning" -- he didn't recognize the larger risk to the company that needed to be disclosed.
Ms. Kestenbaum continued: "In light of recent events, with the casting director, we are recommending that there be a change in status. We now think there is something new. Troubling."
"This is a deal breaker," she concluded.
'And now the end is here'
This was effectively the end of Mr. Moonves's career at CBS. He was fired on Sept. 9, 2018. With him gone, the "nuclear option" lawsuit collapsed just days later, when both sides agreed to dismiss the case. CBS and Viacom merged in 2019, and were renamed Paramount Global.
Ms. Redstone had finally prevailed. But the empire she now controlled was beset by new competitive threats and upheavals in the media landscape.
There's no question that combining CBS and Viacom allowed the company to gain greater scale. But Wall Street analysts were skeptical. And by the measure that Sumner Redstone cared most about -- the stock price -- the merger has failed to stem the company's decline. The combined market capitalization of Viacom and CBS was $ 30 billion when the merger was announced in 2019. Paramount Global's valuation is about half that. It was up against competitors that were many times larger: Amazon (market capitalization of over $ 1 trillion), Netflix (about $ 160 billion) and Walt Disney (about $ 200 billion).
While its competitors seized the opportunities presented by the digital revolution, Viacom and CBS lost precious years to their internal struggles. It's safe to say the intracompany warfare before 2018 delivered the worst possible outcome -- neither a merger of CBS and Viacom nor a sale to someone else.
It's not clear to what extent Mr. Redstone understood or was able to savor his daughter's win. Peter Bart, who was a longtime editor of Variety and close to Mr. Redstone, was granted a rare visit in 2019.
"His withered hand signaled a greeting, or the semblance of one," Mr. Bart reported in a column for Deadline Hollywood. "His eyes flickered weakly, but his effort at conversation was reduced to a grunt, mixed with an occasional scream of rage and frustration over his limitations." Mr. Redstone was bedridden, being fed intravenously, and "a team of nurses and conservators stand by for needed assistance," Mr. Bart observed.
On the morning of Aug. 11, 2020, Mr. Redstone's nurse called Ms. Redstone to tell her she thought the end was near.
Ms. Redstone told the nurse to put warmers on her father's hands and to hold him. She kept the phone line open so her father could hear her talk.
Over the next several hours, she reviewed his life's accomplishments. She promised to take care of the family and to nurture the business empire he had created. "It will be here forever," she assured him. "I love you," she said over and over.
Finally the nurse told her that Mr. Redstone had quietly stopped breathing.
He was 97. National Amusements, the family's holding company, announced his death, describing him as "the self-made businessman, philanthropist and World War II veteran who built one of the largest collections of media assets in the world."
Despite the father and daughter's late-in-life reconciliation, Ms. Redstone could never be certain she had gained her father's love or approval given his impaired faculties.
Just after Mr. Redstone died, Ms. Redstone reached out to Tad Jankowski, her father's friend and longtime business colleague, for reassurance. Had she done the right thing? she wondered, citing the changes on the Viacom board and the firing of Mr. Moonves. Would her father have approved? Had he really loved her?
What could he say? Mr. Jankowski emphasized that Mr. Redstone had loved a fight and loved to win. Ms. Redstone had never given up. He would be proud of her.
Mr. Redstone's remains were flown to his hometown, Boston. Ms. Redstone and two of her children accompanied the hearse to the family plot at Sharon Memorial Park. Because of the pandemic, no one else was present except for Ms. Redstone's ex-husband, a rabbi, who conducted the burial ceremony.
The gathering was so intimate that Ms. Redstone felt no need to restrain her emotions. She knelt so close to the grave her children worried she might fall in. Between bouts of crying, she told her father everything she had ever wanted to say to him.
Finally she stopped. "Is there anything else?" she asked.
Her daughter reminded her that Mr. Redstone had asked that Frank Sinatra's recording of "My Way" be played at his funeral. Ms. Redstone had always cringed on the many occasions her father insisted on listening to it. But now she asked her daughter to pull up the lyrics on her phone. Ms. Redstone began singing:
And now the end is here
And so I face that final curtain
She struggled through the five verses, each ending with the refrain:
"I did it my way."

Activist Investor Ends Bid For Seat on Disney Board: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nelson Peltz withdrew a day after Bob Iger, the chief executive, announced a restructuring that will cut $ 5.5 billion in costs and roughly 7,000 jobs.
Behind the scenes at Disney on Thursday, senior executives were giddy. The activist investor Nelson Peltz, in a surprise morning phone call to CNBC, had ended his attempt to install himself or his son on Disney's board and shake up the company.
"Toodle-oo!" one Disney television executive texted a reporter, along with a screen shot of the CNBC headline.
In truth, it was a victory for both sides. Disney was able to avoid adding an unwanted activist to its board. Mr. Peltz was able to say he succeeded in pushing Disney to cut costs, revamp its streaming business, refocus on profit growth and reinstate its dividend, which it suspended in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Disney aggressively addressed each of those items on Wednesday in an effort to short-circuit Mr. Peltz's proxy battle, which had been set to culminate at Disney's annual shareholder meeting on April 3.
"The proxy fight is over," a representative for Trian Partners, an investment firm led by Mr. Peltz, said in a statement. "This is a win for all shareholders." Trian accumulated roughly $ 1 billion in Disney shares at a price of roughly $ 90 a share as part of its campaign. Disney was trading at about $ 110 on Thursday.
Disney's board responded by praising Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive. In the fall, in part to thwart Mr. Peltz, who was privately pushing to join the Disney board, Disney fired Bob Chapek as chief executive and rehired Mr. Iger, who held the position from late 2005 to early 2020. Mr. Chapek's troubled reign lasted less than three years.
"We are pleased that our board and management can remain focused without the distraction of a proxy contest, and we have tremendous faith in Bob Iger's leadership and the transformative vision for Disney's future he set forth yesterday," Disney's board said in a statement.
Carrying out that vision will be difficult. Disney, like other big entertainment companies, is scrambling to make streaming profitable as a way to offset traditional television, which is in a free fall. In Disney's most recent quarter, operating profit from traditional television (the ABC broadcast network and 15 cable channels, led by ESPN) totaled $ 1.3 billion, a 16 percent decrease from a year earlier. Disney attributed the declines to lower advertising revenue, reflecting a drop-off in viewership, especially overseas, as more people forgo cable and satellite hookups.
Across Hollywood, companies are slashing budgets. Warner Bros. Discovery has already cut thousands of jobs as part of a $ 3.5 billion retrenchment. But the playing field is not level: Apple and Amazon continue to pour money into their streaming services, making it more difficult for older companies like Disney to compete for filmmakers, show creators and stars.
Mr. Iger must also contend with Ike Perlmutter, 80, the irascible chairman of Marvel Entertainment and a significant Disney shareholder in his own right. Mr. Perlmutter contacted Disney board members and senior executives six times between August and November to push for Mr. Peltz to join the board. Does Mr. Perlmutter remain at Disney?
A skirmish in Florida between Disney and Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to simmer. In a reversal from last year, the Florida House voted on Thursday to allow Walt Disney World to keep tax benefits enacted in the 1960s. Under the bill, which headed to the State Senate, Disney would no longer be able to choose the members of a board overseeing the resort's tax district; the governor would appoint all five.
On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Iger delivered quarterly financial results that broadly pleased investors. Profit and revenue exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Losses in Disney's streaming division abated. Walt Disney World and Disneyland, in California, generated $ 2.1 billion in profit, an increase of 36 percent from a year earlier.
Those were largely Mr. Chapek's results. The quarter was two-thirds finished by the time Mr. Iger took over in late November.
Mr. Iger, however, laid a framework for Disney's future on top of the numbers, one that left Mr. Peltz with little ground to stand on. Disney would cleave costs not by a little, Mr. Iger said, but by $ 5.5 billion and eliminate 7,000 jobs. Disney's streaming businesses would be managed differently as part of a restructuring designed to galvanize Disney's film and television studios and focus on profitability. The company's dividend would be restored by the end of the year.
"Our cost-cutting initiatives will make this possible," Mr. Iger said of the dividend. "And while initially it will be a modest dividend, we hope to build upon it over time."
It added up to a master class in dismantling a corporate threat. Mr. Iger came across as tough, cleareyed and decisive. He even handed out candy to Disney fans, announcing plans to build an "Avatar" attraction at Disneyland and new installments in the "Toy Story" and "Frozen" franchises.
Disney shares rose 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday following the results. "To Profitability ... and Beyond!" Michael Morris, a Guggenheim Securities analyst, wrote in a report to clients. Several other analysts raised their outlook for Disney shares.
Before dawn on Thursday in Los Angeles, Mr. Iger continued his campaign on CNBC. He said that "everything was on the table" regarding Hulu, the general-audience streaming service that Disney controls. Some analysts have wondered if Disney should sell Hulu, but Disney previously signaled that it intended to double-down on the service. Comcast owns a 33 percent stake in Hulu, and Disney had been trying to buy it out.
"I'm concerned about undifferentiated general entertainment, particularly given the competitive landscape that we're operating in, and we're going to look at it very objectively," Mr. Iger said.
Mr. Peltz had also been pushing Disney to clean up its messy succession planning. Mr. Iger had delayed his retirement from Disney at least three times and, in some ways, seemed reluctant to leave the company when he did. In bringing him back, the board gave him two years to steer the company onto the right path and groom another successor.
Mr. Iger told CNBC that work to identify a successor was "already underway," with Disney's incoming board president, Mark Parker, scheduled to lead a private meeting about it on Friday.
"My plan is to stay here for two years," Mr. Iger said. "That's what my contract says. That was the agreement with the board."
Shortly afterward, Mr. Peltz phoned CNBC to say Mr. Iger's restructuring announcement indicated Disney "plans to do everything we wanted them to do."
"We wish the very best to Bob, his management team, the board," Mr. Peltz said. "We will be watching. We will be rooting."
Shares of Disney closed down about 1.3 percent on Thursday, roughly in line with the market.
"Peltz has always been more rational and focused on specific goals than many of his ego-driven competitors," said John Coffee, a professor of corporate governance at Columbia Law School. "I see this as a case in which rationality has triumphed and Trian has no need to fight a battle that it has effectively already won."
Besides, carrying out a proxy battle would cost Trian roughly $ 25 million, according to a securities filing.
"Part of activism is always realizing that the aim of an activist is not to get board seats," said Patrick Gadson, a co-chair of the shareholder activism practice at the law firm Vinson & Elkins.
"They don't get paid to get board seats. They make money by, when it all boils down to it, stock price appreciation."

New York Philharmonic Lures Maestro of Celebrity and Youth: [National Desk]

Full text: Dudamel, a charismatic 42-year-old conductor, will take up the Philharmonic's podium in 2026, in a major coup for the orchestra.
LOS ANGELES -- Gustavo Dudamel, the charismatic conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, whose fiery baton and bouncy curls have made him one of classical music's most recognizable figures, will leave his post in 2026 to become the music director of the New York Philharmonic, both orchestras announced on Tuesday.
"What I see is an amazing orchestra in New York and a lot of potential for developing something important," he said in an interview. "It's like opening a new door and building a new house. It's a beautiful time."
The appointment of Dudamel, 42, is a major coup for the New York Philharmonic, the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States, which was once led by giants including Mahler, Toscanini and Bernstein. Just a decade ago, there were concerns about its future, given the languishing efforts to renovate its lackluster hall and questions about its artistic direction. Now its home, David Geffen Hall, has reopened after a $ 550 million renovation, and it has secured in Dudamel the rare maestro whose fame transcends classical music, even as he is sought by the world's leading ensembles.
His departure is a significant loss for Los Angeles, where since 2009 Dudamel has helped build a vast cultural empire and helped turn the orchestra into one of the most innovative and financially successful in the United States.
He was lured east by Deborah Borda, the New York Philharmonic's powerful president and chief executive, in an instance of classical music history repeating itself. She signed the 26-year-old Dudamel to the Los Angeles Philharmonic back when she led that ensemble, and helped make him a superstar in its relatively new Walt Disney Concert Hall. Now she hopes to repeat that success in New York.

"It's a wonderful match," said Borda, who arranged the deal in one of her last big pieces of business before she steps down from her post at the end of June. "I'm joyous for our orchestra. I'm joyous for our city."
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Dudamel, one of the highest-paid artists in the industry, earned $ 2.8 million during a recent season in Los Angeles. In New York, he will be given the expanded title of music and artistic director, to match his current role. He will succeed Jaap van Zweden -- first as music director designate in the 2025-26 season, then as the orchestra's 27th music director in the 2026-27 season -- with an initial contract for five years.
Dudamel, who was born in Venezuela, will be the orchestra's first Hispanic leader, in a city where Latinos make up about 29 percent of the population. His appointment comes as the Philharmonic has worked to connect with new audiences, especially young people and Black and Latino residents.
Classical music audiences typically skew older, but Dudamel is a rare figure who has been able to galvanize traditionalists and newcomers alike. He has made nurturing a younger generation of artists and music fans a priority, building a youth orchestra in Los Angeles modeled on El Sistema -- the Venezuelan-based movement, in which he trained, that weds teaching and social work.
And he is unique among modern conductors for his pop-culture celebrity. Dudamel has appeared in a Super Bowl halftime show and voiced Trollzart in the animated film "Trolls World Tour." He inspired the wunderkind Latin American conductor played by Gael García Bernal on the Amazon series "Mozart in the Jungle" and made a cameo appearance on the show. ("Hear the Hair" was its parody of a classical music marketing campaign.) In addition to making recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, he has conducted on soundtracks of a recent "Star Wars" film and Steven Spielberg's version of "West Side Story." In 2019, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Dudamel now faces the difficult task of attempting to raise the New York Philharmonic's standing in American cultural life while helping it navigate a series of challenges, including dwindling ticket revenues, shifting audience behavior since the pandemic and persistent questions about the relevance of classical music and live performance today.
Dudamel said that as music and artistic director, he would champion new music and work to develop the orchestra's sound, now that the musicians had a hall in which they could fully hear each other onstage.
"There are no limits, especially in an orchestra with such a history," he said. "I see an incredible infinite potential of building something unique for the world."
Dudamel, who has been the music director of the Paris Opera since 2021, and of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela since 1999, was a favorite for the podium in New York as soon as it became vacant. In the fall of 2021, van Zweden announced that he would step down at the end of the 2023-24 season after a six-year tenure.
When Dudamel appeared at the Philharmonic last spring, for a two-program Schumann symphony cycle, some players, hoping to win him over, showed up to rehearsals bearing gifts and handwritten notes. Inside his dressing room, a group of musicians gave him a bottle of the Brooklyn-made Widow Jane bourbon, telling him the Philharmonic would welcome him if he could find a way to spend more time in New York.
"Everything comes alive with him," said Christopher Martin, the orchestra's principal trumpet. "Everything is as natural as breathing."
Borda said that it was Dudamel's long and fruitful relationship with the Philharmonic -- he has led 26 concerts with the orchestra since his debut in 2007 -- that had made him the choice of the musicians, board members and managers. She recounted meeting him secretly in various European cities over the past year, often flying in and out within 24 hours to avoid suspicion, as she tried to secure a deal. (Seeing him in Los Angeles, she said, "just didn't feel kosher.")
In October, when Dudamel was in New York to perform at Carnegie Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, she took him on a tour of the renovated hall during a rehearsal, taking a circuitous route to sneak him onto the third tier so that even the orchestra's musicians would not know. The attempt at secrecy was foiled when they bumped into Lin-Manuel Miranda, who was preparing for a gala performance.
The secrecy was broken on Tuesday afternoon when the New York Philharmonic's musicians were summoned for an announcement shortly after a rehearsal with the guest conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. Some worried that the news would be bad; only members of the orchestra committee knew what the meeting would be about.
With the players reunited onstage, Borda and her successor, Gary Ginstling, stepped onto the podium.
"Our next music director will be," Borda said, with a pause, "Gustavo Dudamel."
The musicians erupted into 20 seconds of applause, in a journey from wide-eyed surprise to whistles and cheers, genuine expressions of joy. Judith LeClair, the bassoonist, was the most animated of them, looking dumbfounded before holding a radiant smile through the rest of Borda's speech.
"The Philharmonic has had its ups and downs," Borda told them. "And it had an amazing time in the '60s, when we were golden," she added, referring to Bernstein's music directorship. "I really feel the promise of that again."
Afterward, members of the orchestra were visibly elated. The oboist Ryan Roberts, who grew up in Los Angeles, called his mother there: "Mom, guess who our new music director is." She could be heard responding with Dudamel's name, virtually screaming with excitement.
The appointment of Dudamel is the latest chapter in a remarkable career. Born in the Barquisimeto, Venezuela, he grew up in a musical family: His mother was a voice teacher, and his father a trombonist who played in salsa bands. He enrolled in El Sistema as a child and studied violin and composition before pursuing conducting.
He sometimes faced questions about his ties to Venezuelan leaders -- he conducted at the funeral of President Hugo Chávez -- but tried to remain above the political fray. But in 2017, after a young El Sistema-trained viola player was killed during a street protest, Dudamel issued a statement that said "enough is enough" and wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times accusing the government of flouting the Venezuelan constitution. President Nicolás Maduro canceled several overseas tours by Dudamel and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra as punishment, and Dudamel did not return to Venezuela until a quiet trip late last year.
Dudamel has been a champion of new music, collaborating in Los Angeles with composers including John Adams and Gabriela Ortiz. He has also joined forces with pop and jazz stars, such as Billie Eilish and Herbie Hancock. The New York Times critic Zachary Woolfe wrote in 2017 that the Los Angeles Philharmonic was "the most important orchestra in America. Period."
At the New York Philharmonic, Dudamel will lead an organization that is smaller than his Los Angeles empire, and one that has struggled in recent decades with financial troubles. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, with its Frank Gehry-designed Disney Hall as well as the Hollywood Bowl, garnered about $ 187 million in yearly revenue before the pandemic. The New York Philharmonic earned $ 86 million.
Chad Smith, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, congratulated Dudamel on the move, praised his tenure there for leaving "indelible marks on classical music" and hinted at the orchestra's next steps.
"From our earliest days, the L.A. Phil has been a trailblazer, boldly embracing the new, welcoming the world's greatest artists to our stages and redefining the role of an orchestra in our community," he said in a statement. "The search for our next music director will be conducted with this same spirit as we define the future of our organization."
Dudamel broke the news on Tuesday to Los Angeles players after a rehearsal, telling them that he would always be an Angeleno.
Dale Breidenthal, a violinist in the orchestra, said Dudamel's departure was stunning for the ensemble. "We haven't processed it," she said on her way out from the rehearsal. Still, she added, New York needed his talents. "We are really excited for him," she said.
Dudamel said he did not expect to build a replica of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in New York. "It's impossible," he said. "They are completely different cultures."
Still, he said, he would like to explore the idea of creating a youth education program similar to his efforts in Los Angeles. "It will be very important that we really develop social action through music," he said. "For artistic institutions in the world, it's important to embrace and to build. It will be very beautiful."
Borda, who returned to New York in 2017 after 17 years at the helm of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, balanced the New York Philharmonic's budget and built up its once-depleted endowment. She also helped bring to fruition the long-delayed renovation of Geffen Hall, working with Henry Timms, the president and chief executive of Lincoln Center, to push it through ahead of schedule during the pandemic shutdown.
That renovation has helped to revitalize the orchestra; speaking with the players on Tuesday, Borda told them, "It's really because of you that he's coming" but added, "And I have to say, it doesn't hurt to have a nicer hall."
Paid attendance so far this season has hovered around 88 percent, compared with 74 percent before the pandemic, though the revamped hall is somewhat smaller. But the ensemble is still grappling with a host of questions about its identity and vision.
Borda offered Dudamel two gifts while wooing him. One, given early in the search, was a program book from a Philharmonic tour of Venezuela in 1958, with a cover designed by the artist Carlos Cruz-Diez.
The other, which he received as the deal was being finalized, was a pencil that was used to compose music by an artist who will now be his predecessor: Leonard Bernstein.
Dudamel said in the interview that he would always maintain a connection to Los Angeles.
"I don't feel that I'm leaving this place or that it will be goodbye forever," he said. "All the time I have spent here and all the experience that I have built here, I will bring to New York to build something new. This is life. I don't feel that it's an end."

Full text: The superstar conductor's hiring is the New York Philharmonic's attempt to recapture the populist glamour it enjoyed under Leonard Bernstein in the 1960s.
Gustavo Dudamel becoming the New York Philharmonic's next conductor is a seismic event for the city's cultural scene.
Gifted and energetic, Dudamel, 42, is the rare classical artist to break into the mainstream. He has made albums with the world's top orchestras -- and voiced an animated character in "Trolls World Tour." He is the music director of the venerable Paris Opera -- and inspired the wild-haired maestro protagonist of the Amazon series "Mozart in the Jungle." He can shuttle between a Mahler symphony and a "Star Wars" soundtrack, between a John Adams premiere and a Super Bowl halftime show.
So New York hiring Dudamel is a huge coup, promising full houses and the devotion of donors. But his being poached from the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- for a five-year contract beginning with the 2026-27 season -- was also entirely predictable.
Over the past six years, New York's Philharmonic has been remodeling itself after Los Angeles's, the most ambitious and progressive major orchestra of the 21st century. In 2017, New York stole away Los Angeles's chief executive, Deborah Borda, who brought Dudamel to California when he was a 20-something wunderkind.
Borda gave New York's programming an L.A.-style, contemporary-minded face-lift. She helped complete a long-delayed renovation of David Geffen Hall that made the space more intimate and congenial -- and conspicuously similar to Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.
Top executive, check. Programming, check. Hall, check. It was only a matter of time before Dudamel came on board -- famous conductor, check -- for what has swiftly become the Los Angeles Philharmonic East.
But if he is the final step in the Californiafication of Geffen Hall, he is also the fulfillment (or the attempt at one) of the New York Philharmonic's slower burning, less openly acknowledged longing: to recapture the populist glamour it enjoyed under Leonard Bernstein, its music director from 1958 to 1969.
Since then, through the ups and downs of six successors, there has been a palpable sense that the Philharmonic essentially wants a repeat of the Bernstein of the 1960s, when he was not just one of America's best known musicians, but also one of its best known figures, period.
Bernstein was a best-selling author who used his network-TV platform to render newly accessible the intricacies of Beethoven's Fifth, sonata form and jazz, and who had composed, with "West Side Story," a Broadway and Hollywood sensation. Friendly with the Kennedys, Lauren Bacall and Alice B. Toklas, he was as familiar from the society pages as from the arts section.
The mists of memory have erased some smudges. Critics sniped at his over-the-top emotiveness on the podium and at his long breaks between appearances with the orchestra. Not every piece he touched turned to gold.
But whatever actually happened, the Philharmonic quickly came to perceive his as the true glory days of the nation's oldest orchestra, which was founded in 1842 and has included luminaries like Mahler and Toscanini among its directors. With Bernstein conducting, its opening concert at its new Lincoln Center home in 1962, broadcast on CBS, was the top-rated show in its time slot that night. So enthusiastic were audiences that even when Bernstein took a sabbatical in the 1964-65 season, sold-out performances persisted.
The decades since have hardly been unmitigated failures. Pierre Boulez -- like Bernstein, a composer, though in a more recondite modernist mode -- innovated with repertory mixtures and concert formats. Zubin Mehta had easy charisma; Kurt Masur, old-world gravitas; Lorin Maazel, analytic brilliance; Alan Gilbert, D.I.Y.-style modesty; Jaap van Zweden, driven precision.
But the post-Bernstein years -- even Mehta's 13-year run, the orchestra's longest-ever directorship -- come across in many tellings as a bit of an anticlimax. Not since Lenny, the story goes, has the fit been exactly right, either in terms of the music-making or the whole romanticized feeling of being in the middle of it all, hitched to an actual star.
Until now?
For all the warmth he inspires in musicians, Dudamel isn't Bernstein. Talented and charming, he isn't a public communicator like Bernstein was. His fame, befitting our era, is about his vigor and visual silhouette -- that popcorn halo of curls -- more than his ability to articulate the meaning of Mahler in words for a mass audience.
And we now live a very different time than the '60s, for culture in general and classical music in particular. The recording industry is a shadow of the giant that created and promoted over 200 of Bernstein's incendiary, soulful collaborations with the Philharmonic. The orchestra now barely makes PBS, let alone CBS. The globe-trotting tours during which Bernstein was greeted like a liberating hero have been sharply curtailed.
And Dudamel's conducting can be uneven. His cycle of Schumann symphonies with the Philharmonic last season was spirited and unpretentious, naturally unfolding and fresh, more than deep or intense. Dvorak's "New World" Symphony, in 2020, was full of underlinings and italicizations, the work of a young man intent on making his presence known in a standard.
But even if he doesn't lecture on Mahler in prime time, his Mahler can be excellent, as in his strong, sincere Ninth Symphony recording with Los Angeles, from 2012. (In May, the Ninth will fill his first performances with the New York Philharmonic since his hiring.) While Dudamel is not a composer like Bernstein, his commitment to education and his advocacy for new music -- both pillars for Borda and her team in California -- have been as unfaltering as his great predecessor's. Both men managed to connect with audiences long schooled to think that only Europeans could have authority in the classics.
Dudamel is altogether as close a figure to Bernstein as any conductor in the world today, with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to go with the capacity crowds at the Hollywood Bowl. Like Bernstein, he has achieved genuine civic stature -- and like Bernstein, enough of one to occasionally enmesh him in controversy. Dudamel was sharply criticized for continuing to work in his native Venezuela as humanitarian crises mounted under its president, Nicolás Maduro; under pressure, he spoke out against the Venezuelan government in 2017.
There were other options New York could have pursued -- acclaimed podium leaders even further from being household names. Santtu-Matias Rouvali, a few years younger than Dudamel, has had considerable success with the Philharmonic, as have more established hands like Manfred Honeck and Susanna Mälkki.
But there has long been, in this orchestra's music director choices, a sense of a pendulum swinging, each maestro the greatest possible contrast to the one before -- a key sign of an organization always looking for a singular savior, an answer to the problem of the moment, rather than making leadership decisions that emanate from sustained core values.
So it makes perfect sense that Dudamel, a superstar, would be the choice after van Zweden, a minor character even within the music industry. Van Zweden, in turn, was a martinet specialist in the standards who seemed appealing as an about-face from Gilbert, less electric in the core repertory. Gilbert's familial closeness to the Philharmonic -- both his parents were players -- was seen as the antidote to Maazel's remoteness. And so on, back to Bernstein. It's a recipe for short-term satisfaction, and short tenures.
It's also important to remember that Bernstein wasn't merely a star; he was a visionary. When he came back to the Philharmonic from that mid-60s sabbatical, for example, he announced that his programs over the next two years would be dominated by 20th-century works -- not short pieces, but substantial symphonies and concertos. That venture came from him, not from administrators whose marching orders he was executing.
So we'll see whether Dudamel just offers the easy sheen of celebrity, or whether he'll be connected organically to the orchestra, its growth and its city. He will certainly face challenges vastly more daunting than in Los Angeles, where that Philharmonic is the looming titan on the music scene. In New York, to the chagrin of conductor after conductor, you're competing with the world's greatest ensembles, constantly touring through Carnegie Hall with their best, most polished programs.
"A lot of us think," Zubin Mehta once said, "why not send our worst enemy to the New York Philharmonic and finish him off, once and for all."
Dudamel will immediately disrupt the city's cultural center of gravity -- including at Lincoln Center, where attention has long been weighted toward the mighty, publicity-grabbing Metropolitan Opera. For the Philharmonic, basking in robust attendance at its newly reopened hall as orchestras around the country are struggling, he offers the hope of further fending off a downturn. The question is whether he can fully break the New York music director curse for the first time since you-know-who.
When Bernstein announced he wouldn't extend his contract past 1969, he said, "I shall always regard the Philharmonic as 'my' orchestra." And in a way, it has been his ever since -- still in thrall to what he represented and the feelings he inspired, still seeking to recapture all that.
The Philharmonic is finally getting what it's wanted. Now we'll see what the orchestra does with it.

Gustavo Dudamel, Star Maestro, to Leave LA for New York Philharmonic

LOS ANGELES — Gustavo Dudamel, the charismatic conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, whose fiery baton and bouncy curls have made him one of classical music’s most recognizable figures, will leave his post in 2026 to become the music director of the New York Philharmonic, both orchestras announced on Tuesday.
“What I see is an amazing orchestra in New York and a lot of potential for developing something important,” he said in an interview. “It’s like opening a new door and building a new house. It’s a beautiful time.”
The appointment of Dudamel, 42, is a major coup for the New York Philharmonic, the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States, which was once led by giants including Mahler, Toscanini and Bernstein. Just a decade ago, there were concerns about its future, given the languishing efforts to renovate its lackluster hall and questions about its artistic direction. Now its home, David Geffen Hall, has reopened after a $550 million renovation, and it has secured in Dudamel the rare maestro whose fame transcends classical music, even as he is sought by the world’s leading ensembles.
His departure is a significant loss for Los Angeles, where since 2009 Dudamel has helped build a vast cultural empire and helped turn the orchestra into one of the most innovative and financially successful in the United States.
He was lured east by Deborah Borda, the New York Philharmonic’s powerful president and chief executive, in an instance of classical music history repeating itself. She signed the 26-year-old Dudamel to the Los Angeles Philharmonic back when she led that ensemble, and helped make him a superstar in its relatively new Walt Disney Concert Hall. Now she hopes to repeat that success in New York.
“It’s a wonderful match,” said Borda, who arranged the deal in one of her last big pieces of business before she steps down from her post at the end of June. “I’m joyous for our orchestra. I’m joyous for our city.”
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Dudamel, one of the highest-paid artists in the industry, earned $2.8 million during a recent season in Los Angeles. In New York, he will be given the expanded title of music and artistic director, to match his current role. He will succeed Jaap van Zweden — first as music director designate in the 2025-26 season, then as the orchestra’s 27th music director in the 2026-27 season — with an initial contract for five years.
Dudamel, who was born in Venezuela, will be the orchestra’s first Hispanic leader, in a city where Latinos make up about 29% of the population. His appointment comes as the Philharmonic has worked to connect with new audiences, especially young people and Black and Latino residents.
Classical music audiences typically skew older, but Dudamel is a rare figure who has been able to galvanize traditionalists and newcomers alike. He has made nurturing a younger generation of artists and music fans a priority, building a youth orchestra in Los Angeles modeled on El Sistema — the Venezuelan-based movement, in which he trained, that weds teaching and social work.
And he is unique among modern conductors for his pop-culture celebrity. Dudamel has appeared in a Super Bowl halftime show and voiced Trollzart in the animated film “Trolls World Tour.” He inspired the wunderkind Latin American conductor played by Gael García Bernal on the Amazon series “Mozart in the Jungle” and made a cameo appearance on the show. (“Hear the Hair” was its parody of a classical music marketing campaign.) In addition to making recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, he has conducted on soundtracks of a recent “Star Wars” film and Steven Spielberg’s version of “West Side Story.” In 2019, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Dudamel now faces the difficult task of attempting to raise the New York Philharmonic’s standing in American cultural life while helping it navigate a series of challenges, including dwindling ticket revenues, shifting audience behavior since the pandemic, and persistent questions about the relevance of classical music and live performance today.
Dudamel said that as music and artistic director, he would champion new music and work to develop the orchestra’s sound, now that the musicians had a hall in which they could fully hear one another onstage.
“There are no limits, especially in an orchestra with such a history,” he said. “I see an incredible infinite potential of building something unique for the world.”
Dudamel, who has been the music director of the Paris Opera since 2021, and of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela since 1999, was a favorite for the podium in New York as soon as it became vacant. In the fall of 2021, van Zweden announced that he would step down at the end of the 2023-24 season after a six-year tenure.
When Dudamel appeared at the Philharmonic last spring, for a two-program Schumann symphony cycle, some players, hoping to win him over, showed up to rehearsals bearing gifts and handwritten notes. Inside his dressing room, a group of musicians gave him a bottle of the Brooklyn-made Widow Jane bourbon, telling him the Philharmonic would welcome him if he could find a way to spend more time in New York.
“Everything comes alive with him,” said Christopher Martin, the orchestra’s principal trumpet. “Everything is as natural as breathing.”
Borda said that it was Dudamel’s long and fruitful relationship with the Philharmonic — he has led 26 concerts with the orchestra since his debut in 2007 — that had made him the choice of the musicians, board members and managers. She recounted meeting him secretly in various European cities over the past year, often flying in and out within 24 hours to avoid suspicion, as she tried to secure a deal. (Seeing him in Los Angeles, she said, “just didn’t feel kosher.”)
In October, when Dudamel was in New York to perform at Carnegie Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, she took him on a tour of the renovated hall during a rehearsal, taking a circuitous route to sneak him onto the third tier so that even the orchestra’s musicians would not know. The attempt at secrecy was foiled when they bumped into Lin-Manuel Miranda, who was preparing for a gala performance.
The secrecy was broken on Tuesday afternoon when the New York Philharmonic’s musicians were summoned for an announcement shortly after a rehearsal with guest conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. Some worried that the news would be bad; only members of the orchestra committee knew what the meeting would be about.
With the players reunited onstage, Borda and her successor, Gary Ginstling, stepped onto the podium.
“Our next music director will be,” Borda said, with a pause, “Gustavo Dudamel.”
The musicians erupted into 20 seconds of applause, in a journey from wide-eyed surprise to whistles and cheers, genuine expressions of joy. Judith LeClair, the bassoonist, was the most animated of them, looking dumbfounded before holding a radiant smile through the rest of Borda’s speech.
“The Philharmonic has had its ups and downs,” Borda told them. “And it had an amazing time in the ’60s, when we were golden,” she added, referring to Bernstein’s music directorship. “I really feel the promise of that again.”
Afterward, members of the orchestra were visibly elated. Oboist Ryan Roberts, who grew up in Los Angeles, called his mother there: “Mom, guess who our new music director is.” She could be heard responding with Dudamel’s name, virtually screaming with excitement.
The appointment of Dudamel is the latest chapter in a remarkable career. Born in the Barquisimeto, Venezuela, he grew up in a musical family: His mother was a voice teacher, and his father a trombonist who played in salsa bands. He enrolled in El Sistema as a child and studied violin and composition before pursuing conducting.
He sometimes faced questions about his ties to Venezuelan leaders — he conducted at the funeral of President Hugo Chávez — but tried to remain above the political fray. But in 2017, after a young El Sistema-trained viola player was killed during a street protest, Dudamel issued a statement that said “enough is enough” and wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times accusing the government of flouting the Venezuelan constitution. President Nicolás Maduro canceled several overseas tours by Dudamel and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra as punishment, and Dudamel did not return to Venezuela until a quiet trip late last year.
Dudamel has been a champion of new music, collaborating in Los Angeles with composers including John Adams and Gabriela Ortiz. He has also joined forces with pop and jazz stars, such as Billie Eilish and Herbie Hancock. The New York Times critic Zachary Woolfe wrote in 2017 that the Los Angeles Philharmonic was “the most important orchestra in America. Period.”
At the New York Philharmonic, Dudamel will lead an organization that is smaller than his Los Angeles empire, and one that has struggled in recent decades with financial troubles. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, with its Frank Gehry-designed Disney Hall as well as the Hollywood Bowl, garnered about $187 million in yearly revenue before the pandemic. The New York Philharmonic earned $86 million.
Chad Smith, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, congratulated Dudamel on the move, praised his tenure there for leaving “indelible marks on classical music” and hinted at the orchestra’s next steps.
“From our earliest days, the LA Phil has been a trailblazer, boldly embracing the new, welcoming the world’s greatest artists to our stages and redefining the role of an orchestra in our community,” he said in a statement. “The search for our next music director will be conducted with this same spirit as we define the future of our organization.”
Dudamel broke the news on Tuesday to Los Angeles players after a rehearsal, telling them that he would always be an Angeleno.
Dale Breidenthal, a violinist in the orchestra, said Dudamel’s departure was stunning for the ensemble. “We haven’t processed it,” she said on her way out from the rehearsal. Still, she added, New York needed his talents. “We are really excited for him,” she said.
Dudamel said he did not expect to build a replica of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in New York. “It’s impossible,” he said. “They are completely different cultures.”
Still, he said, he would like to explore the idea of creating a youth education program similar to his efforts in Los Angeles. “It will be very important that we really develop social action through music,” he said. “For artistic institutions in the world, it’s important to embrace and to build. It will be very beautiful.”
Borda, who returned to New York in 2017 after 17 years at the helm of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, balanced the New York Philharmonic’s budget and built up its once-depleted endowment. She also helped bring to fruition the long-delayed renovation of Geffen Hall, working with Henry Timms, the president and chief executive of Lincoln Center, to push it through ahead of schedule during the pandemic shutdown.
That renovation has helped to revitalize the orchestra; speaking with the players on Tuesday, Borda told them, “It’s really because of you that he’s coming” but added, “And I have to say, it doesn’t hurt to have a nicer hall.” Paid attendance so far this season has hovered around 88%, compared with 74% before the pandemic, though the revamped hall is somewhat smaller. But the ensemble is still grappling with a host of questions about its identity and vision.
Borda offered Dudamel two gifts while wooing him. One, given early in the search, was a program book from a Philharmonic tour of Venezuela in 1958, with a cover designed by artist Carlos Cruz-Diez.
The other, which he received as the deal was being finalized, was a pencil that was used to compose music by an artist who will now be his predecessor: Leonard Bernstein.
Dudamel said in the interview that he would always maintain a connection to Los Angeles.
“I don’t feel that I’m leaving this place or that it will be goodbye forever,” he said. “All the time I have spent here and all the experience that I have built here, I will bring to New York to build something new. This is life. I don’t feel that it’s an end.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Falling Mortgage Rates Bring Some Homebuyers Back to Market

Earlier in the pandemic, when many urbanites were leaving New York to work remotely in far-flung locations, Molly Parker Wade instead moved from the West Coast to New York to be closer to her family.
After a year of renting, Wade, a 35-year-old public relations executive for Amazon, was ready to buy, just as the cost of home loans began to climb sharply. Late last year, mortgage rates hit a two-decade high, putting a chill on the housing market — and her buying plans.
“I spent 2022 learning about mortgages,” she said.
Undeterred by high rates, Wade closed on a $975,000 one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn in December. “It felt like the right thing to do at the right time,” she said.
Homebuyers are edging back into the market after being sidelined last year by a jump in borrowing costs and soaring housing prices. Although mortgage rates are coming down — the average rate on the most common home loan fell to a five-month low this week, making purchases relatively more affordable — real estate experts say what matters more for buyers and sellers now is the state of the economy, which is especially hard to gauge.
“It’s jobs, jobs, jobs,” said Sam Khater, chief economist at mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac. Although the economy is solid, “if all these recession forecasts come to fruition, it would be a big deal,” he added.
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter of last year, the government reported last week, as Americans continued to spend despite stubbornly high inflation. The International Monetary Fund projected this week that the U.S. economy would slow this year and the jobless rate would rise, but there was “a narrow path that allows the U.S. economy to escape a recession altogether, or if it has a recession, the recession would be relatively shallow,” according to the organization’s chief economist.
As part of their effort to tame rising consumer prices, Federal Reserve policymakers raised interest rates again Wednesday, by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, the eighth increase in 11 months. Fed officials are trying to slow the economy enough to bring inflation back under control, without inducing a severe recession.
“Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said after the central bank’s announcement.
The Fed’s actions have helped cool the once-hot housing market, but mortgage rates have recently started to fall again — partly on investors’ expectations that the central bank’s campaign of rate increases is nearing an end — which could spur more activity in the housing market. New-home sales, which are particularly sensitive to changes in mortgage rates, rose 2.3% in December from the month before, the Census Bureau reported last week.
Because stronger economic growth could lead the Fed to raise rates higher, and keep them elevated for longer, homebuyers and sellers face a tricky balance of their confidence in the economy and what that might mean for borrowing costs. They, like Fed officials, would like to see a so-called soft landing, in which the economy cools in such a way that inflation moderates but doesn’t slow so much that it makes big-ticket purchases like buying a home more daunting than it already is.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.09% this week, Freddie Mac reported Thursday, down from 6.13% the week before. Rates had climbed to 7.08% in October, the highest level since 2002.
Falling mortgage costs “will generally boost demand a little bit because more folks will be able to buy,” said Nicole Bachaud, senior economist at Zillow, a site that estimates home values.
But she cautioned that home prices, which have been ticking lower on a monthly basis, remained high because owners who had locked in low rates years ago had little incentive to sell now.
“We will be seeing prices fall for the next few months, but that will be minimal,” she said, predicting a price decline of 1% to 2% nationally in the coming year.
More homes are being sold at or below list price, but many sellers are not budging, Bachaud said. New listings have slowed to a trickle, and homes are staying on the market for longer. Sales of existing homes fell 1.5% in December, the 11th consecutive monthly decline, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Industry watchers say that reluctant owners will be more likely to put their homes on the market if average mortgage rates fall another half a percentage point, to 5.5%.
“Five and a half is where people get really comfortable,” said Nicole Rueth, a senior vice president at OneTrust Home Loans, a lender based in Denver. Until then, she added, owners will be motivated to sell by personal circumstances: “I’m having a baby, I’m getting married, I need to downsize, I need to move for my job.”
For Jessica Grupp, buying a home coincided with the end of her active duty in the Navy. She had been renting in San Diego, and she wanted to stay after she finished her service.
“I’ve wanted to buy here for a while,” she said.
As the market cooled and conditions became favorable again, Grupp, 33, found a two-bedroom apartment in the city’s University Heights neighborhood. Her offer of $640,000 — $10,000 below the asking price — was accepted, and she moved in with her dog, Kanna, in October.
Now a consultant for PwC, Grupp is happy she bided her time.
“For me, it was finding a place that fit my lifestyle and budget,” she said.
More stories like hers would be welcomed by the real estate industry, which struggled last year as the market slowed down. Several online brokerage firms — including Compass, Redfin and Zillow — have laid off workers, and Redfin and Zillow have closed their house-flipping businesses. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp is reportedly in talks with the commercial real estate data provider CoStar to sell Move, a digital real estate business that includes Realtor.com and related sites.
“Home sales are probably bottoming out now or will in the first quarter this year,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.
The resilient economy, solid job market and low levels of mortgage defaults are among the reasons the housing market is stabilizing, he said, and he predicted that mortgage rates would slide to 5.5% by late spring or early summer.
“Stability is good, especially in light of the big changes that occurred in the past three years,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Sneakers and Songs Are Among His Specialties: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Footwear News Achievement Awards, sometimes called the Oscars of shoes, shines a spotlight on the industry's top designers. But when the singer Dua Lipa won for a Puma collection last November, her frequent collaborator Billy Walsh bolted at the sight of flashing cameras.
"Billy Walsh's five-seconds limit on the red carpet," Ms. Lipa said, as photographers shouted her name at Cipriani Wall Street.
"More like two seconds," Mr. Walsh, 40, added safely from the sidelines.
Avoiding attention is a peculiar trait for a man who collaborates with some of the biggest names in pop, including Ms. Lipa, Post Malone and the Weeknd, straddling the upper echelons of fashion and music.
He has collaborated with Rihanna on a Fenty collection with Puma, and consulted Kanye West on video directors. As a fashion stylist, he dressed the Weeknd in Givenchy for the Met gala and James Blake in Yohji Yamamoto for awards shows.
But his biggest achievements are in songwriting. His co-writing credits include "Sunflower" by Post Malone and Swae Lee, and six tracks on Mr. West's "Donda" album -- and those are just counting his Grammy nominations.
"Billy is part of a small group of people in this industry that I consider to be like family," Mr. Malone said by email. Their shared writing catalog also includes the hits "I Fall Apart," "Better Now," "Wow" and "Circles." "Not only is he one of the best songwriters, but he is a brilliant creative and fashion designer."
On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Walsh went shopping at Dover Street Market, the retail temple in Manhattan where he often goes for inspiration. "I would come here to do massive pulls for the Weeknd," he said. "I used to start on the top floor and work my way down."
He still does. As he flipped through racks of Raf Simons and Junya Watanabe on the seventh floor, Mr. Walsh recounted this unorthodox rise in the recording and street wear industries. "Fashion and music are definitely interrelated, but I guess I don't know too many people who have succeeded in both," he said. "I stay in the back and don't need credit."
Dressed in an all-black "uniform" (T-shirt, Prada nylon shorts, Alyx socks and Nike Air Tuned Max sneakers), with his signature shaved head and platinum veneers, he has the tough-guy appearance of a post-apocalyptic British rude boy.
Mr. Walsh credits his dexterity to his rough-and-tumble upbringing in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. His father, William Walsh, a folk musician who performed at local Irish pubs, encouraged him to write poetry and dance. He was also an obsessive sneaker head. "I drove my mom crazy looking all over the city for the Adidas Equipment Basketball shoes with the interchangeable, different-colored socks," he said.
Other addictions followed. He started drinking at 11, often getting into after-school brawls until he sobered up a decade later.
At 18, he headed to Los Angeles to study dance at Loyola Marymount University, and signed with an agent. But dance gigs were few and far between, so he spent most of his 20s as a nightclub promoter, working alongside his brother at Hollywood hot spots like Emerson Theater and Hyde, where he would party with a young Post Malone and future designers like Matthew M. Williams of Givenchy.
In 2011, the choreographer Fatima Robinson, who he met at Eden, a Hollywood nightclub, encouraged him to stop dancing and focus on poetry and design instead. "This woman literally saved my life," he said.
He quit auditioning and busied himself with writing poetry and daydreaming about street wear. He looked inside his sneaker closet and began experimenting with Frankenstein combinations. One of the first designs cobbled together was a white Nike Air Force One with a black rubber creeper sole. "I always wondered what a creeper would look like with certain old sneakers from my childhood," he said.
He wore his custom sneakers to the clubs, which would get noticed by emerging V.I.P.s like Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott. In 2014, with seed money from fellow party promoters, he and a friend started a street wear label called Mr. Completely, which reimagined classic sneakers including Adidas Sambas and Stan Smiths.
To promote the brand, he held a party at Fourtwofour on Fairfax and invited everyone he knew. Among them was the stylist Jahleel Weaver, who ordered several pairs for his client Rihanna. That turned out to be a propitious sale. A few months later, Rihanna invited Mr. Walsh to design her debut collection with Puma (which went on to win the Footwear News "Shoe of the Year" two years later).
Sneakers opened other doors. One of them led to Illangelo, a veteran Canadian producer, who became a confidant and his unexpected entree into music writing. Once again, it started at a nightclub. The two were clubbing on the Sunset Strip in 2014 when Illangelo mentioned that he was disappointed by the state of songwriting. Seizing the moment, Mr. Walsh shared a short poem from his iPhone Notes app.
Illangelo was so impressed that he brought Mr. Walsh into studio sessions with Alicia Keys and he ended up getting his first mainstream writing credit on the song, "In Common." Illangelo also introduced Mr. Walsh to the Weeknd, who at first was only interested in working with him as a stylist. (The two shared an appreciation for military bomber jackets.) But as Mr. Walsh's reputation as a songwriter began to rise, the Weeknd began bringing him into the studio.
Those sessions resulted in three tracks from the 2016 album‌‌ "Starboy," including "True Colors" and "Die ‌for You," which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 this month, seven years after it was first released, thanks to going viral on TikTok.
Mr. Walsh has since gone on to write more than 100 songs for artists as varied as the Kid Laroi ("Without You"), pop powerhouses like Mr. Malone and Ms. Lipa, and rock royalty like Ozzy Osbourne ("Ordinary Man"). His publishing catalog has racked up a combined 20 billion streams. Last November, "Sunflower" went 17 times platinum, becoming the highest-certified single of all time.
His soaring music career hasn't stopped him from other creative pursuits. In 2016, he started Donavan's Yard, a nightlife collective in Los Angeles with the D.J.s Drew Byrd and Sean G that hosts parties in Tokyo and a streaming concert series on Amazon Music Live. Branded merch is sold at Dover Street Market,
In October, he started a conceptual street wear label called Iswas with Keith Richardson, his creative partner at Mr. Completely. The label currently sells one item: a pair of painter's pants made from Japanese selvage denim that costs $ 450.
Wearing many hats, Mr. Walsh said, affords him creative freedom. "If Abel knows I am winning an award with Dua and doing my own clothing line, he respects that I'm doing OK for myself," he said, referring to the Weeknd by his given name. "No one feels like you're too dependent."
Back at Dover Street, Mr. Walsh went from floor to floor, examining the clothing racks like an archaeologist at a fresh dig. On the shoe floor, he picked up a pair of cloven-toed "tabi" boots by Martin Margiela. "I appreciate what this guy does," he said of the designer, who, like himself, shuns the limelight in favor of letting his work speak for itself.
After about two hours, he reached the Rose Bakery on the ground floor, took a seat and ordered an Earl Grey tea. As ambient music played overhead, he reflected on his unusual journey. "My success comes from artists recognizing that I see the creative process as sacred, somewhat secret," he said. "I am never the main focus, just as it should be."

From Boom To Bust: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Dealership are seeing sales and prices drop as consumers tighten their belts, putting financial pressure on companies, like Carvana, that grew fast in recent years.
About a year ago, the used-car business was a rollicking party. The coronavirus pandemic and a global semiconductor shortage forced automakers to stop or slow production, pushing consumers to used-car lots. Prices for pre-owned vehicles surged.
Now, the used-car business is suffering a brutal hangover. Americans, especially people on tight budgets, are buying fewer cars as interest rates rise and fears of a recession grow. And improved auto production has eased the shortage of new vehicles.
As a result, sales and prices of used cars are falling and the dealers that specialize in them are hurting.
"After a huge run-up in 2021, last year was a reality check," said Chris Frey, senior manager of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive, a market research firm. "The used market now faces a challenging year as demand weakens."
According to Cox, used-car values fell 14 percent in 2022 and are expected to fall more than 4 percent this year. That shift means many dealers may have no choice but to sell some vehicles for less than they paid.
The industry's difficulties have been exemplified by Carvana, which sells cars online and became famous for building "vending machine" towers where cars can be picked up. The company recently reported a quarterly loss of more than $ 500 million, and has laid off 4,000 employees.
In the last 12 months, Carvana piled up debt. Its stock price has fallen more than 95 percent in the last 12 months, and three states temporarily suspended its operating license after consumer complaints.
"We think there's a decent chance the company will end up having to file for bankruptcy protection," said Seth Basham, an Wedbush analyst. "They have too much debt for the level of sales and profitability and can't support that debt load, and likely will need to restructure."
In a statement to The New York Times, Carvana said it was confident it had "sufficient" funds to turn its business around, noting that the company had $ 2 billion in cash and an additional $ 2 billion in "other liquidity resources" at the end of the third quarter.
It has also hired the investment bank Moelis & Company and is working to reduce its inventory of vehicles and cut the cost of reconditioning them.
"Millions of satisfied customers have responded positively to Carvana's e-commerce model for buying and selling cars," the company said. "Although the current environment and market has drawn attention to the near term, we continued to gain market share in the third quarter of 2022, and we remain focused on our plan to drive to profitability."
CarMax, another used-car giant, is also hurting, although it is on much steadier ground. In the three months that ended in November, its vehicle sales fell 21 percent to 180,000, and net income tumbled 86 percent, to $ 37.6 million.
CarMax is trying to avoid deep price cuts to ensure it makes money on each sale, said its chief executive, Bill Nash, even if that means the company's overall sales are falling. "We're trying to strike a nice balance between making sure our cars are priced right but also trying to maintain our margins," he added.
CarMax is being more cautious about acquiring cars and trucks until prices stop declining, Mr. Nash said. In its most recent quarter, the company bought 238,000 cars from individuals and dealers, about 40 percent fewer than it did a year earlier.
The buying and selling of used cars is an enormous business. Cox Automotive expects about 36 million used vehicles will be sold in the United States this year. Fewer than half as many new cars and trucks are expected to be sold in 2023.
Many consumers turn to slightly used cars to avoid paying the full price of a new vehicle. For consumers with lower incomes or weak credit ratings, older used cars with a lot of miles on the odometer are often the only option.
The Federal Reserve's campaign to raise interest rates to fight inflation has made it harder and more expensive to buy cars. In December, the average interest rate on used-car loans was 12.37 percent, up from less than 10 percent a year before, according to Cox Automotive.
CarMax is still attracting shoppers to its website, Mr. Nash said, but many now end their search when they realize how much they are likely to pay per month. "People click and see their payment, and that's where they balk," he said.
The used-car business is made up of thousands of small outlets, many of them family businesses. CarMax is the largest player in the market but accounts for only a sliver of total sales.
Founded in 1993, CarMax tried to make the fragmented used-car business more efficient in the same way Blockbuster once sought to do with the video-rental business. CarMax has produced steady profits for more than a decade. It has about 240 locations and last year sold more than about 900,000 cars to consumers.
CarMax is well positioned despite the difficult conditions it faces, Mr. Basham said: "I think they're going to emerge from this downturn as one of the best-positioned companies to take additional market share."
Carvana is a much younger company. It was founded in 2012 by Ernest Garcia III, its chief executive, and his father, Ernest Garcia II, who is the owner and founder of a separate used-car business called DriveTime. The son has sought to create the Amazon of used cars, a fully online retailer where shoppers can buy a car on a website or app, and have the vehicle delivered to their door.
To build its brand, Carvana constructed 75-foot-tall parking garages that can store about two dozen cars and operate like giant vending machines. Customers can opt to pick up a car at one of the towers.
Last summer, Jerry Speers, a technology professional in Nashville, bought a 2021 Alfa Romeo Stelvio sport utility vehicle from Carvana for about $ 35,000. It was his third purchase from the company.
"I hate spending hours in a dealership, so I liked the idea of doing it all online," he said. "I researched it at my own pace for a few weeks and then signed the deal. A week or two later, a truck pulled up to my house with the car."
When the pandemic forced car buyers to shop online, Carvana became a Wall Street darling and its stock soared, reaching a high of about $ 345 a share in 2021.
But the hoopla obscured some operational troubles. The company has never reported profit for a full year in the nearly 10 years that its shares have traded on the stock market. It has spent a lot of money to add retail locations, build towers and refine its online platform.
In some markets, it has struggled to grow amid stiff competition. In Denver, Carvana's vending machine tower has stood empty for months. CarMax has four locations around Denver. Another rival, AutoNation, opened two used-car dealerships in the Denver area in 2021, and supplies them with inventory from cars traded in at its 17 new-car franchises in the area.
"The used business in Colorado has seen some challenges with inventory, so self-sourcing vehicles is a considerable strength for us in this environment," Marc Cannon, AutoNation's chief marketing officer, said.
Carvana said it expected to open the Denver location "in the near future."
The logistics of delivering cars and processing all the paperwork have proved challenging for Carvana. So many consumers complained about long delays getting titles to cars they bought from the company and other issues that North Carolina temporarily suspended Carvana's business license in 2021. Michigan and Illinois took similar steps in 2022.
The company said it had resolved state complaints with settlements that "allow us to continue selling and buying cars."
Carvana's financial difficulties were compounded in May when it bought an auto auction company with the help of $ 3.75 billion in new bonds just as interest rates were starting to rise. Carvana's debt payments have soared, and many investors are worried about the company's prospects. On Jan. 25, the stock closed at about $ 6.50.
"They closed this acquisition at the worst time," Mr. Basham said. "They added so much debt, it created an albatross around their neck."
But Carvana pushed back on criticism, saying in its statement that the acquisition gives it the ability to expand and offer customers a wider choice of vehicles and faster delivery times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gautam Adani is facing perhaps his biggest challenge yet as a small U.S. investment firm accuses his Indian conglomerate of fraud and stock manipulation.
Louis Vuitton. Tesla. Amazon. The businesses behind the richest people in the world need no introduction. But last year, a name that does not command the same global recognition joined this rarefied list.
The new entrant was the Adani Group, an Indian conglomerate that controls ports, coal mines, food businesses, airports and more. The group's astronomical rise had given Gautam Adani, its politically connected founder, a fortune of nearly $ 120 billion, according to Bloomberg, putting him in the company of Bernard Arnault, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
Mr. Adani's time in that echelon did not last long. Even though he remains enormously wealthy, on paper Mr. Adani has lost more than a quarter of his wealth, or more than $ 36 billion, within days. And he is facing perhaps the biggest challenge of his career.
Last week, Hindenburg Research, a small investment firm in New York, accused Mr. Adani's company of "brazen accounting fraud, stock manipulation and money laundering." The Adani Group has rejected the claims from Hindenburg, which stands to profit if the conglomerate's shares fall.
On Tuesday Adani Enterprises, Mr. Adani's flagship company, raised $ 2.5 billion by selling new shares to investors, a move in the works before Hindenburg's report. The sale provided a brief respite from the bad news, and then shares of his companies resumed their descent the next day.
In a surprise move on Wednesday, Adani Enterprises reversed course and said it was scrapping the offering, citing "market volatility." It said in a statement that it wanted to "protect the interest of its investing community" and would return the money.
Since the report, the Adani Group has shed tens of billions of dollars in market value in less than a week. And Mr. Adani's reach -- he runs one of the biggest conglomerates in India -- could portend a wider fallout for a country that has been a global economic bright spot.
"He's a risk to the Indian financial system," said Tim Buckley, an analyst in Sydney, Australia, who has followed Mr. Adani's business for more than a decade.
Here's what you need to know about the Adani Group, its founder and Hindenburg Research.
The Adani Group reached new heights in recent years.
Mr. Adani started a polymers import-export business in the 1980s and gradually expanded into infrastructure.
In the 1990s, he started building a port in Mundra, in his home state of Gujarat. He went on to add coal mines, power plants and airports to his portfolio. In the last decade, he secured one of his biggest international deals -- the Carmichael project in Australia, one of the largest open-pit coal mining operations in the world.
Last year, the Adani Group bought a cement business in India from Holcim, a multinational construction company based in Switzerland. In another sign of the diversification of his business, Mr. Adani took control of NDTV, an independent news outlet.
The Adani conglomerate's success in some ways paralleled the growing Indian economy, which is now the fifth largest in the world. Mr. Adani, 60, has styled himself as an industrialist who is helping to address his country's lack of infrastructure.
Critics say Mr. Adani's political connections set him apart.
The Adani Group would not be where it is, its detractors say, without its founder's proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has helped the company win lucrative contracts or, in some cases, have bidding rules changed altogether.
Mr. Modi, like Mr. Adani, is from Gujarat, and when Mr. Modi became prime minister in 2014, he flew to New Delhi on an Adani plane. Mr. Adani's relationship with Mr. Modi has created a widespread perception in India that Mr. Adani can strike any deal he wants, creating an uneven playing field.
Mr. Adani has rejected claims of preferential treatment. The foundations of his business, he said in a recent interview, were laid in the 1980s, when the Indian government relaxed trade restrictions.
"My professional success is not because of any individual leader but because of the policy and institutional reforms initiated by several leaders and governments over a long period of more than three decades," Mr. Adani told the magazine India Today.
Mr. Adani faced controversy before Hindenburg's allegations.
The billionaire has generally kept a low profile even as he has become one of the richest men in the world. He is a follower of the Jain religion, which emphasizes asceticism, and he and his family tightly control his conglomerate. (Hindenburg has criticized the ownership structure of his company.)
Months before Hindenburg made its allegations, the dizzying rise of an Adani subsidiary's shares drew scrutiny. Much of the trading activity in the subsidiary, Adani Enterprises, was traced to holding companies based in tax havens, leading to speculation that the stock -- which had helped propel Mr. Adani's personal wealth -- was being manipulated. Shares in Adani's seven subsidiaries have soared more than 800 percent in the past three years, according to Hindenburg.
Previously, Mr. Adani's company faced investigations into allegations of tax impropriety related to coal imports but was eventually cleared. Mr. Adani was also linked to an Indian stock market manipulation scam engineered by a Mumbai stockbroker, Ketan Parekh.
As Mr. Adani's business empire has grown, he has turned to foreign banks to fund his acquisitions and investments. That, said Mr. Buckley, the Australian analyst, could mean more scrutiny.
"The big issue is that Adani has spent the last four years in raising debt on Wall Street," Mr. Buckley said. "If you raise money in America, you have to play by America's rules."
Hindenburg has a good track record.
Named after the famous doomed airship, Hindenburg is what is known as an activist short seller on Wall Street. The firm hunts for frauds and other irregularities in public markets, exposes the wrongdoing and makes money while doing so. It profits when its target, often a publicly traded company, sees a drop in its share price.
Activist short sellers have been criticized by some for betting against businesses. The shorts say they are helping police the market.
Hindenburg, which is only a few years old, has targeted about 30 companies and made its name by taking down Nikola, the electric vehicle maker. According to Bloomberg News, stocks in those companies fell about 15 percent, on average, the day after Hindenburg issued its reports, and were down 26 percent six months later.
In the Adani Group, Hindenburg's founder, Nathan Anderson, has taken on a goliath. Hindenburg said it had researched Mr. Adani's businesses for two years before publishing its report on Jan. 24. The Adani Group has threatened to sue Hindenburg, which responded by saying it would welcome a suit in the United States, where it could demand Adani documents as part of legal discovery.
Among Hindenburg's allegations are that offshore shell companies run by Mr. Adani's older brother, Vinod Adani, helped the conglomerate manipulate its share prices. The shell companies are also used to launder money from private Adani companies to the publicly listed ones, Hindenburg said, "to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency."
Highlighting what it called "obvious accounting irregularities and sketchy dealings," Hindenburg said the fact that the listed Adani companies did not have long-serving chief financial officers was a red flag. The short seller also called into question the quality of the independent auditor for two subsidiaries, Adani Enterprises and Adani Gas. Employees of the auditor were "essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country."
Hindenburg went on to say that even if its allegations were ignored, the Adani Group companies were so overvalued that their stocks could fall 85 percent. The group, Hindenburg added, is also overburdened by debt.
The Adani Group has called Hindenburg's allegations an attack on India and its "growth story and ambition." Hindenburg has countered by saying, "India's future is being held back by the Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation."
The fight could have geopolitical implications, given the United States' courting of India as a counterweight to China, as part of a grouping called the Quad that also includes Japan and Australia, Mr. Buckley said. It is unclear how the conflict will be resolved, but one thing is certain, he said: "It is going to be very complicated."

Adani’s time in that echelon did not last long. Even though he remains enormously wealthy, on paper Adani has lost more than one-quarter of his wealth, or more than $36 billion, in the past few days. And he is facing perhaps the biggest challenge of his career.
Last week, Hindenburg Research, a small investment firm in New York, accused Adani’s company of “brazen accounting fraud, stock manipulation and money laundering.” The Adani Group has rejected the claims from Hindenburg, which stands to profit if the conglomerate’s shares fall.

Is a Spoonful of Sea Moss the Key to Good Health?

In videos on TikTok, influencers wince as they dig spoons into jars of what looks like slime. Sometimes the glop is pale green or yellow, sometimes it’s deep red. Some people wrinkle their noses and grimace as they swallow a dollop; others sniff their spoons and grin into the camera. “It kind of smells like ocean water,” one woman said before choking down a glob and then covering her mouth, appearing to gag, eyes watering. “It’s really good,” she said flatly and unconvincingly, blinking away tears. “I’m going to do it every day.”
They are among a number of people online who have been promoting the health benefits of sea moss — an edible sea vegetable in the algae family that is packed with nutrients like folate, vitamin K, vitamin B, iron, iodine, magnesium, zinc and calcium.
While the plant can be consumed raw and in supplement form — including as pills, powders and gummies — it’s most often eaten as a gel, made by soaking the dried plant in water, blending it and letting it coalesce in the fridge. Some claim that a scoop or more per day can heal their gut, clear their skin, regulate their menstrual cycle, strengthen their immune system or help them shed pounds. But is this hype based on science?
Here’s what to know before slurping down a spoonful.
What is sea moss?
Sea moss is a spiky, frilly sea vegetable that somewhat resembles frisée lettuce when it’s in the ocean. It thrives along the Atlantic coasts, mainly between North America and Europe, and in the warm waters of Asia, South America, Africa and parts of the Caribbean. When dried and packaged, the plant looks like cooked ramen noodles, with tangled tendrils that clump together. Food manufacturers harvest it for its carrageenan, an ingredient that acts as a thickening agent for foods like ice cream, chocolate milk and creamers.
But because it’s so nutrient-rich, people sometimes eat it in hopes of improving their health — swirling the gel into smoothies, blending it into puddings or eating it straight from a jar.
The gel often tastes fishy and has a slick, slimy texture. Raw sea moss can also have an earthy, ocean-like taste, not unlike an oyster or a clam — which can be off-putting to some, said Brooke Levine, a dietitian nutritionist at NYU Langone Health.
When did sea moss become so popular?
Sea moss has received a number of celebrity endorsements on social media in recent years. In 2020, Kim Kardashian shared on Twitter that she drank sea moss smoothies as part of her diet; last summer, Erewhon Market, a grocery chain based in Los Angeles, released “Hailey Bieber’s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie” — complete with sea moss gel. Rapper Meek Mill mused online in 2019 that maybe sea moss made him smarter, and in 2021, former Disney Channel actress Skai Jackson said she ate sea moss “every single day.”
Sea moss also gained attention last fall when a flurry of panicky social media posts from fans of the plant claimed that the Food and Drug Administration was going to ban all sea moss products, possibly because of certain unproven health claims. While the FDA has issued warning letters to makers of sea moss-containing products in the past (including to a company that claimed its product could prevent or treat COVID-19), the posts about the ban turned out to be based on misinformation. But the passionate reactions of some users showed just how fervent a following the plant had gained.
Is sea moss actually good for you?
Sea moss, in gel or other forms, can be a relatively low-calorie conduit to adding more nutrients to your diet, said Dr. Melinda Ring, the executive director of the Osher Center for Integrative Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The plant is rich in antioxidants, which can break down free radicals that damage our cells, she said. And sea moss gel contains large amounts of potassium, an essential mineral that supports muscle contraction and blood pressure control.
But while nutrition experts say that the nutrients in sea moss might offer some health benefits, the hype is probably overblown, Ring said. “Like all of the superfoods that have come and gone, there’s some truth to it,” she said. “It’s just not a magical thing that everyone should be taking.”
No clinical trials have investigated whether sea moss is beneficial for humans, Levine said, though seaweed in general has been well researched: It’s packed with vitamins and minerals similar to those found in sea moss, and some studies suggest that certain fatty acids and vitamins in some types of seaweed, like omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins D and B12, can help strengthen the immune system.
But without hard and fast data on sea moss itself, Ring said, its health effects aren’t totally clear.
Besides, Levine said, you’re most likely already getting the same nutrients found in sea moss if you follow a well-balanced diet. And if you don’t, she said, consuming sea moss won’t counteract poor nutrition choices. “It won’t help to eat sea moss gel if you’re getting a Big Mac,” Levine said.
Instead of turning to sea moss for a nutritional boost, she said, a few rolls of sushi containing seaweed can help supply comparable amounts of B vitamins and zinc. You can also get many of the nutrients in sea moss from leafy greens like kale, arugula or Swiss chard, said Mary Ellen DiPaola, a senior outpatient dietitian at the University of California, San Francisco.
Kristin Kirkpatrick, a dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic, agreed. “When a patient comes to me and says, ‘I saw this on TikTok, I’m thinking about taking it,’ I’m like, ‘That’s great, how about having more broccoli?’ ” she said.
Can sea moss help you lose weight?
Despite what some people are saying online, sea moss won’t suddenly speed up your metabolism, Kirkpatrick said. It does, however, contain plenty of prebiotic fiber, a food source for the good bacteria in your gut, which can help regulate your digestive system, she said.
Theoretically, sea moss gel could contribute to weight loss because its goopy consistency makes it slow to leave our stomachs, keeping us fuller for longer, Ring said, but it’s not guaranteed.
Can sea moss keep you from getting sick?
The individual nutrients found in sea moss — like B vitamins and zinc — indicate that, theoretically, the gel could help support your immune system, Ring said. But without data or clinical trials, there’s no proof that sea moss can prevent or cure any disease.
Are there risks associated with eating sea moss?
Sea moss contains high levels of iodine, which can damage your thyroid if consumed in large quantities, Ring said. If you want to try it, she recommended taking no more than two tablespoons of the gel at a time and using it every other day, rather than every day.
Like seaweed, sea moss may contain trace amounts of heavy metals like aluminum or cadmium, depending on where it’s grown. So you should be careful to not overdo it, Ring said.
If you’re taking sea moss in supplement form, keep in mind that the FDA does not strictly regulate supplements, so you can never be 100% sure that what is stated online or on a package is what’s in the product.
Is sea moss worth shelling out for?
A bag of the dried plant, which you can use to make sea moss gel at home, can be expensive. Some sellers on Amazon list it for around $20 per pound, others for around $80 per pound. A 16-ounce jug of premade gel can run around $15 on the lower end, or $60 on the higher end.
If you decide the expense is worth it, swallowing a spoonful of sea moss isn’t likely to harm you, experts said. But it won’t transform your health or body, either.
“When we’re having a conversation about diet, there’s never been a situation where we’ve found one food is the salvation we were searching for,” Kirkpatrick said. “It’s always a combination of factors.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Climate Start-Ups Entice Jaded Tech Workers: [National Desk]

Full text: Tech workers and investors are flocking to start-ups that aim to combat climate change.
When Arebeth Pease was laid off from the tech start-up MasterClass last year, she could have had her pick of jobs. But so many tech companies' missions rang hollow, she said, and many were creating more problems than they were fixing.
Ms. Pease, 42, was drawn instead to Span, a start-up that makes smart home electrical panels and is among a class of fast-growing companies aiming to combat climate change. She joined Span in September as an operations manager, with the start-up's focus on slowing the effects of climate change as the main selling point.
"We're actually doing work that matters," she said.
As tech companies slash perks and cut jobs, the downturn has spurred a wake-up call among many workers, causing them to question whether their company's role in society -- selling ads or selling stuff, often -- was actually making the world a better place. The result? More are now flocking to climate start-ups, just as investors pour money into the field.
Last year, climate start-ups in the United States raised nearly $ 20 billion, topping 2021's high of $ 18 billion and nearly tripling 2020's $ 7 billion, according to Crunchbase, a data provider. At least 83 climate-focused companies around the world are worth more than $ 1 billion, according to HolonIQ, a research firm.
Despite worries of a recession, enthusiasm about climate start-ups is undimmed. Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of the investment firm BlackRock, recently declared that 1,000 more $ 1 billion so-called climate unicorns were on the way.
"There is no line of business that will not be impacted by climate," said Chris Sacca, one of the founders of Lowercarbon Capital, a climate-focused venture capital firm, at a conference run by Axios in October. "That's also the opportunity."
The momentum and excitement, investors said, are different from the cleantech boom of the mid-2000s, when investors poured money into a cohort of clean energy companies that were reliant on government subsidies. Many of those start-ups eventually went under.
"There were a lot of lessons learned from the first cleantech wave," said Ben Marcus, an investor at the venture capital firm UP.Partners. "Investors are not just looking to invest in science projects but in real companies."
Now broader economic trends have coalesced to bolster the market. The cost of renewable energy has fallen over the last decade. The Securities and Exchange Commission last year proposed a rule that would require companies to report their emissions, creating demand for tools to measure them. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, dedicated $ 370 billion to climate-related spending.
Large corporations have also elevated climate-focused initiatives to the boardroom, with 91 percent of the global economy now covered by "net zero" pledges of some sort, according to Net Zero Tracker, a nonprofit site.
Climate tech is "one of the few bright spots in the economy and one of the few industries that tend to be extremely recession-resilient," said Rick Zullo, an investor at the venture capital firm Equal Ventures.
At least 135 funds focused on climate investing, with $ 94 billion under management, have been created since 2021, according to the newsletter Climate Tech VC. The largest tech investment firms -- including Sequoia Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Atlantic and TPG -- have increased their investments in climate-tech companies, as have corporate investors like Salesforce and United Airlines.
Lila Preston, an investor at Generation Investment Management, the investment firm that Al Gore helped found in 2004, said the momentum was welcome and "absolutely needed."
"You want the very best investors around the table with you when you are disrupting industries," she said.
Still, with Silicon Valley-style growth comes Silicon Valley-style hype. Many in the industry are wary of the risks of too much money flowing into climate start-ups at inflated valuations. Some fear that the excitement will lead to more "greenwashing" -- when businesses make "green" marketing a priority over actual impact -- and infighting over which solution is best, ultimately damaging the industry's credibility.
But the stakes are too high to be cynical, climate entrepreneurs and investors said.
"There's a bigger fight to fight," said Elisa Jagerson, an investor at Wildcat Venture Partners. "Everything else feels like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic."
It wasn't always that way. When Julia Collins pitched investors on her climate tech start-up in 2019, she dedicated the first slide of her presentation to a dramatic explanation of the climate emergency. She had created Planet FWD, a software provider that helps businesses manage their climate impact, and Moonshot, a snack food company that uses regenerative ingredients, local suppliers and recycled packaging.
"I had to spend a lot of time on the pitches bringing people up the learning curve," she said.
That has since changed as climate change and extreme weather events became impossible to escape. "We're well beyond the point of having to prove climate change, or that it's a big market," said Ms. Collins, who no longer uses the dramatic slide in her pitches.
Some of the new climate start-ups are already increasing in value, at least on paper, fueled by the floods of cash. Josh Felser, an investor at Climactic, a venture capital firm, said the 11 climate companies that he and a partner had backed over the last two years were now worth two and a half times what they had been at the time of investment because other investors had put more money in at higher valuations.
"It's not because we're that good," he said. "It's because the market is so hot."
Founders said business was booming because potential customers faced more outside pressure to become environmentally friendly, pushing them to spend money on things like emissions trackers and carbon offsets. Infogrid, a start-up that provides tools to make buildings operate and use energy more efficiently, previously had a hard time selling its products to customers, said William Cowell de Gruchy, the company's chief executive.
"Now they're like: 'We've got to do this. Our shareholders are making us. Our boardroom is making us. Regulators are making us,"' he said.
Many tech workers have gone through a similar climate awakening. Olya Irzak, one of the founders of Frost Methane Labs, which helps reduce methane seeps from coal mines and other natural sources, has mentored people who want to work at climate companies for almost a decade. But during the pandemic, more people began reaching out to her and taking an interest in her annual list of climate start-ups, she said.
"People were sitting at home a lot, asking a lot of hard questions," Ms. Irzak said. "That was when the tech talent pool started shifting really dramatically."
One effort, Climate Draft, aims to help climate start-ups find advisers, investors and employees from the tech industry. More than 3,000 recently laid-off tech workers have signed up to learn about jobs at climate companies, the company said. Another online community, Work on Climate, has ballooned to 16,000 members since it began in 2020. People use it to network and learn about jobs.
"Rebuilding every single industry we have is going to require the participation of everybody who is in the work force," said Eugene Kirpichov, a former engineer at Google who helped found Work on Climate.
Diego Saez Gil, a founder of Pachama, a company that funds reforestation and sells carbon credits, said he had recently hired people from Meta, Google, Amazon, Airbnb and Tesla, with some even taking pay cuts to join. That's a change from his past start-ups, where he found it tough to recruit people from big tech companies who would take pay cuts.
"The people coming to climate are missionaries," he said. "They had some kind of awakening. They came to realize, 'The planet is falling apart, and I'm working on making people click on ads."'
That was what happened to Bryan Nella, 47, an account manager who has worked in tech for more than two decades. When pandemic shutdowns briefly cleared the skies of plane and car pollution, he reflected on his impact on society and the environment.
Last year, Mr. Nella joined SemiCab, a start-up that helps trucking companies eliminate miles driven with no cargo. He usually ignored calls from recruiters, he said, but felt inspired by SemiCab's mission to reduce trucking emissions.
"There's a lot more to feel good about," he said.

He Designs Sneakers With Dua Lipa and Writes Songs With The Weeknd

NEW YORK — The Footwear News Achievement Awards, sometimes called the Oscars of shoes, shines a spotlight on the industry’s top designers. But when singer Dua Lipa won for a Puma collection in November, her frequent collaborator Billy Walsh bolted at the sight of flashing cameras.
“Billy Walsh’s 5-seconds limit on the red carpet,” Lipa said, as photographers shouted her name at Cipriani Wall Street.
“More like 2 seconds,” Walsh, 40, added safely from the sidelines.
Avoiding attention is a peculiar trait for a man who collaborates with some of the biggest names in pop, including Lipa, Post Malone and The Weeknd, straddling the upper echelons of fashion and music.
He has collaborated with Rihanna on a Fenty collection with Puma, and consulted Kanye West on video directors. As a fashion stylist, he dressed The Weeknd in Givenchy for the Met gala and James Blake in Yohji Yamamoto for awards shows.
But his biggest achievements are in songwriting. His co-writing credits include “Sunflower” by Malone and Swae Lee, and six tracks on West’s “Donda” album — and those are just counting his Grammy nominations.
“Billy is part of a small group of people in this industry that I consider to be like family,” Malone said by email. Their shared writing catalog also includes the hits “I Fall Apart,” “Better Now,” “Wow” and “Circles.” “Not only is he one of the best songwriters, but he is a brilliant creative and fashion designer.”
On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Walsh went shopping at Dover Street Market, a retail temple in Manhattan where he often goes for inspiration. “I would come here to do massive pulls for The Weeknd,” he said. “I used to start on the top floor and work my way down.”
He still does. As he flipped through racks of Raf Simons and Junya Watanabe on the seventh floor, Walsh recounted this unorthodox rise in the recording and streetwear industries. “Fashion and music are definitely interrelated, but I guess I don’t know too many people who have succeeded in both,” he said. “I stay in the back and don’t need credit.”
Dressed in an all-black “uniform” (T-shirt, Prada nylon shorts, Alyx socks and Nike Air Tuned Max sneakers), with his signature shaved head and chrome-metal grills, he has the tough-guy appearance of a post-apocalyptic British rude boy.
Walsh credits his dexterity to his rough-and-tumble upbringing in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. His father, William, a folk musician who performed at local Irish pubs, encouraged him to write poetry and dance. Walsh was also an obsessive sneaker head. “I drove my mom crazy looking all over the city for the Adidas Equipment Basketball shoes with the interchangeable, different-colored socks,” he said.
Other addictions followed. He started drinking at 11, often getting into after-school brawls until he sobered up a decade later.
At 18, he headed to Los Angeles to study dance at Loyola Marymount University, and he signed with an agent. But dance gigs were few and far between, so he spent most of his 20s as a nightclub promoter, working alongside his brother at Hollywood hot spots such as Emerson Theater and Hyde, where he would party with a young Malone and future designers such as Matthew M. Williams of Givenchy.
In 2011, choreographer Fatima Robinson, whom he met at Eden, a Hollywood nightclub, encouraged him to stop dancing and focus on poetry and design instead. “This woman literally saved my life,” he said.
He quit auditioning and busied himself with writing poetry and daydreaming about streetwear. He looked inside his sneaker closet and began experimenting with Frankenstein combinations. One of the first designs cobbled together was a white Nike Air Force One with a black-rubber creeper sole. “I always wondered what a creeper would look like with certain old sneakers from my childhood,” he said.
He wore his custom sneakers to the clubs, which would get noticed by emerging VIPs such as Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott. In 2014, with seed money from fellow party promoters, he and a friend started a streetwear label called Mr. Completely, which re-imagined classic sneakers including Adidas Sambas and Stan Smiths.
To promote the brand, he held a party at Fourtwofour on Fairfax and invited everyone he knew. Among them was stylist Jahleel Weaver, who ordered several pairs for his client Rihanna. That turned out to be a propitious sale. A few months later, Rihanna invited Walsh to design her debut collection with Puma, which two years later won the Footwear News “Shoe of the Year.”
Sneakers opened other doors. One of them led to Illangelo, a veteran Canadian producer, who became a confidant and his unexpected entree into music writing. Once again, it started at a nightclub. The two were clubbing on the Sunset Strip in 2014 when Illangelo mentioned that he needed a new songwriter. Seizing the moment, Walsh shared a short poem from his iPhone Notes app.
Illangelo was so impressed that he brought Walsh into studio sessions with Alicia Keys, and he ended up getting his first mainstream writing credit on the song “In Common.” Illangelo also introduced Walsh to The Weeknd, who at first was only interested in working with him as a stylist. (The two shared an appreciation for military bomber jackets.) But as Walsh’s reputation as a songwriter began to rise, The Weeknd began bringing him into the studio.
Those sessions resulted in three tracks from the 2016 album “Starboy,” including “True Colors” and “Die for You,” which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 this month, seven years after it was first released, thanks to going viral on TikTok.
Walsh has since gone on to write more than 100 songs for artists as varied as The Kid Laroi (“Without You”), pop powerhouses such as Malone and Lipa, and rock royalty such as Ozzy Osbourne (“Ordinary Man”). His publishing catalog has racked up a combined 20 billion streams. In November, “Sunflower” went 17 times platinum, becoming the highest-certified single of all time.
His soaring music career hasn’t stopped him from other creative pursuits. In 2016, he started Donavan’s Yard, a nightlife collective in Los Angeles with DJs Drew Byrd and Sean G that hosts parties in Tokyo and a streaming concert series on Amazon Music Live. Branded merch is sold at Dover Street Market.
In October, he started a conceptual streetwear label called Iswas with Keith Richardson, his creative partner at Mr. Completely. The label sells one item: a pair of painter’s pants made from Japanese selvage denim that costs $450.
Wearing many hats, Walsh said, affords him creative freedom. “If Abel knows I am winning an award with Dua and doing my own clothing line, he respects that I’m doing OK for myself,” he said, referring to The Weeknd by his given name. “No one feels like you’re too dependent.”
Back at Dover Street Market, Walsh went from floor to floor, examining the clothing racks like an archaeologist at a fresh dig. On the shoe floor, he picked up a pair of cloven-toed “tabi” boots by Martin Margiela. “I appreciate what this guy does,” he said of the designer, who, like himself, shuns the limelight in favor of letting his work speak for itself.
After about two hours, he reached the Rose Bakery, on the ground floor, took a seat and ordered an Earl Grey tea. As ambient music played overhead, he reflected on his unusual journey. “My success comes from artists recognizing that I see the creative process as sacred, somewhat secret,” he said. “I am never the main focus, just as it should be.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Angst rippled across laptop screens this month, with dozens of companies announcing layoffs and finding ways to breed extra chaos in the process.
Kerensa Cadenas opened Slack on Friday morning to an expletive-laden message from a colleague that said essentially: "I got let go." Ms. Cadenas, steeling herself, checked her email. Then she typed out her own expletive. She'd been laid off, too. Alone in her Brooklyn apartment.
Ms. Cadenas, with more than a hundred of her Vox Media colleagues as well as thousands of other workers this week and last, was submerged in a lonely, surreal wave of remote layoffs. People got the news through emails, Slack messages or video calls, then sent their goodbye notes and powered down their computers, with no teammates around to commiserate over beer.
"Normally you're like, 'OK, I can go get drunk,"' said Ms. Cadenas, 37, noting that atop the isolation comes frustration with the instability that so many media workers have now come to accept as a fact of their working lives. "It's scary because I'm like: 'Will I ever have a savings account? Am I ever going to own something? Probably not."'
This month, angst has rippled across laptop screens, with dozens of companies announcing mass layoffs and even the most large and well-established workplaces finding distinct ways to breed extra chaos in the process. More than 1,000 tech companies laid off nearly 160,000 workers last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, which is tracking job cuts across the industry, and another 185 companies have cut some 57,000 tech workers since the start of this year.
Layoffs are among the most challenging life experiences, causing more psychological stress than even divorce, according to one study. Losing a job can upend workers' finances and their sense of self, and layoffs in the world of remote work have in many cases been especially destabilizing, with employer missteps fueling uncertainty and unnecessary unknowns.
At Twitter, employees were notified in the middle of the night that they had been laid off, and at least one worker found out during a team call when that person lost access to company accounts. At the mortgage lending company Better.com, Rena Starr, 33, missed a short and unexpected Zoom meeting in 2021, then texted her boss to learn she and more than 900 of her colleagues had been fired during it. In a later round of job cuts at Better.com, last year, some employees there learned they had been laid off when severance pay hit their payroll accounts; this was months after the chief executive had apologized for summarily firing nearly 10 percent of the company's employees in a roughly three-minute call just before the holidays.
"They're immediately cutting you off from your technological connection," said Sandra Sucher, a professor of management at Harvard who has studied layoffs for more than a decade. "I've been hearing of a number of companies where people were in the middle of things and couldn't continue and didn't know who to address."
Many laid off workers are left with a long list of questions and an utter lack of clarity about who can help them. A recruiter at Amazon was told within four months of starting her job that it would almost certainly be cut, and she was encouraged to accept a severance package. She had to mail back her company computer and doesn't have a personal one, making it challenging to search for a new job.
At some companies, people noted that their teammates were far more helpful than their employers after a layoff. Shortly after losing her job at an e-commerce marketing company in November, Erika Kwee, 32, heard from a colleague who had crowdsourced a list of opportunities and recruiter contacts to help Ms. Kwee navigate her search process.
But many remote workers don't even have their colleagues' phone numbers, and they don't know who to go to for comfort or information. Beth Anstandig, a psychotherapist in the Bay Area, is seeing her clients bear the mental toll of this period.
"I hear that people are not sleeping, or sleeping two hours at a time on their couches," said Ms. Anstandig, who is currently working with both clients conducting layoffs and those experiencing them, many of whom are distressed and overworked. "They're in tears during our meetings together."
Millions of American workers have never known a world without the specter of mass layoffs. That kind of instability has characterized the economy since the late 1970s and '80s, when the notion of prioritizing shareholders above all else took root and companies embraced the strategy of growing fast and then cutting down quick. Some executives rushed to frame that tumult as intrinsic to corporate life: In 1996, Robert Eaton, chief executive of Chrysler Corporation, said that downsizing and layoffs are part of the price of becoming more competitive. Now 85 percent of workers rank job loss as a top concern, according to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer.
Last year ended with job cuts across tech behemoths: Meta laid off more than 11,000 workers, or about 13 percent of its work force, and Lyft laid off 13 percent of its workers. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said last week it plans to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its global work force; Microsoft plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its employees; and Spotify this week said it would cut 6 percent of its work force. For many of these companies, these cuts followed years of free-flowing perks and flexible work arrangements that were part of what was called a "war for talent."
"That is one of the great contradictions of corporate life," Ms. Sucher said. "All corporations say 'People are our most important asset,' but they don't really seem to believe that."
"Calling someone 'talent' is quite different from calling them a person," she added. "People aren't a resource that can be depleted over time."
Trip Barnes, 39, who works in Atlanta, has been laid off three times in the past three years, each experience bringing pangs of grief in a different form. In spring 2020, for example, he got an 8 a.m. call from his longtime boss and was quickly told that he was being laid off from his hospitality staffing role and would be hearing from human resources about the details later that morning.
"Everybody in the moment is trying to get out of the conversation -- get it done quickly," Mr. Barnes said. "It was all about ripping the Band-Aid off."
Two weeks ago, he rewatched his favorite movie, "Up in the Air," a 2009 film that follows a character played by George Clooney whose job is to ax people from corporations. Mr. Barnes resonated, painfully, with the treatment of workers as interchangeable and expendable.
And in some industries, especially media, many workers voiced a sense of resignation with the layoffs that swept their workplaces this month.
Phoebe Gavin, 37, who ran talent and development for Vox.com, said she wasn't surprised when she found out on Friday that she had lost her job. Ever since her role was cut at the storytelling website Upworthy in 2015, Ms. Gavin has been preparing for bouts of unemployment. She has put 10 percent of every paycheck into her savings account, building a nest egg. In 2019, she started a coaching business, which she devoted her Saturdays and early mornings to building, because she wanted to have a backup plan in case she had to deal with losing a job again.
"I don't have any expectation for any company I work for to prioritize my interests," Ms. Gavin said.
But management experts stress that businesses don't have to navigate periods of economic turbulence so haphazardly.
Ms. Sucher noted that Nokia, when it was restructuring in 2011, gave the roughly 18,000 people who would be affected about a year of advance notice and offered them several pathways forward: The company would help them find new roles internally, get new jobs externally, start their own businesses or begin an educational program, among other options.
Nokia's success metrics were whether people had a job lined up when they left the firm, and whether they were leaving with a positive enough impression that they would be open to returning in the future. Nearly two-thirds of people who left knew what their next steps would be.
"This is going to be the lasting impression that sticks with your previous employees, your current employees and all future employees," said Tanner Hackett, chief executive of Counterpart, an insurance technology company that helps small businesses.
Mr. Hackett said companies frequently take a rushed approach to layoffs, as their shareholders watch other industry layoffs happening and expect the same, which contributes to a climate of alarm and also leaves employers open to being sued for wrongful termination or violations of the WARN Act, a 1998 labor law that requires large businesses to give advance notice of mass layoffs. In recent weeks, Mr. Hackett has watched some companies move reactively instead of purposefully in responding to the economic downturn.
Briana Boehmer, 44, drove to her office in Boulder last Wednesday for what she thought was a normal executive meeting at the fitness technology company where she was the chief operating officer and had spent nearly six years working long hours and weekends to support customers. When the meeting started, the founders seemed nervous.
After a few unclear minutes, the chief technology officer jumped in: "So are you saying we're terminated?"
It was a peculiar moment for Ms. Boehmer, who had spent recent months following the news about chaotic layoffs at other tech companies.
"I've been hearing it on these podcasts and being like, 'Oh that's a shame, that's a terrible way to do it,"' she said. "And then I'm like, 'Oh, that just happened to me."'

He Was a Superfan in a Wolf Costume. Now He's Charged in a Bank Robbery.: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Kansas City fans worried when one of their team's most recognizable supporters didn't show up for a game. When he turned up in a Tulsa jail, they wondered if they'd known him at all.
Before he landed in a Tulsa, Okla., jail cell, Chiefsaholic seemed to have an enviable life as a sports fan.
An exuberant, 28-year-old Kansas City Chiefs superfan in a wolf mask, Chiefsaholic attended nearly every game, home and away. N.F.L. broadcasts regularly featured him celebrating in the stands. He shared his adventures with more than 50,000 followers on social media, boasting about bets that would earn him tens of thousands of dollars if he won.
He had a good seat to see his team win the Super Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla., in 2020, and took a selfie with the club's general manager on the confetti-strewn field. He attended quarterback Patrick Mahomes's annual fund-raising gala last month in Kansas City, and apparently won the painting that was featured onstage throughout the event.
The price tag must have been steep. A Super Bowl ticket like his would have fetched about $ 8,500, and an individual ticket to the Mahomes benefit goes for $ 1,250, to say nothing of travel costs.
"That was the only thing I questioned, how is he doing this," said Lynn Schmidt, a superfan known as Weirdwolf.
Chiefsaholic had a simple explanation: hard work.
"After graduating KSU in 2016 I was working a warehouse job making $ 12 an hour," he wrote on Twitter. "Today I manage multiple warehouses throughout the Midwest region and make an excellent living, and I'm only 28 years old. Hard work pays off and don't let ANYONE tell you otherwise!"
Police, court and educational records largely tell a different story, and the source of his money remains a mystery. This much is clear, according to the police: On Dec. 16 in Tulsa, he stopped at a bank.
A Story Made for Hollywood?
How did Kansas City's most ferocious fan become known for his arrest photo instead of just his wolf mask?
Fans started to worry about Chiefsaholic the day after Kansas City defeated the Houston Texans in December. He did not make it to the stadium in Houston. Even more concerning, he did not post about the overtime victory on social media.
"If anyone has seen him or is able to help then please do your thing Chiefs Kingdom," a concerned fan posted on Reddit. One user replied that there were "literally thousands of people concerned for his safety" and that Chiefsaholic lived a clean lifestyle, making it "unlikely (but not impossible) he ran into trouble with authorities."
After a few hours of online sleuthing, fans discovered the answer: Xaviar Babudar, as the authorities know Chiefsaholic, was sitting in a jail cell in Tulsa. He was charged with robbery with a firearm after police say he stuck a "C02 pistol" in a teller's face at a Tulsa credit union. He had been arrested just minutes after the police said they got the call.
There Babudar remains, unable to post his $ 200,000 bond, and it seems it is where he will be when his beloved team plays the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday for a chance to go to the Super Bowl.
The story of a fan in a wolf costume who posted memes, recorded profane hype videos ("Let's go, baby! You already know what it is! Chiefs Kingdom!") and is alleged to have robbed a bank, possibly on his way to the game in Houston, sounds like a made-for-Hollywood romp.
But the truth about Babudar's private life, pieced together from a trail of records left in courthouses and police stations across the country, is more sobering. His father abandoned the family when Babudar was 10, according to court records, and Babudar was arrested repeatedly in his teens and 20s. He appears to have been homeless for many of those years.
As Chiefsaholic, Babudar reinvented himself in the public eye, in the parking lots and stadiums where it's easy to be a character instead of a person and outlandishness isn't just tolerated, but celebrated.
"I thought this was a guy that can carry on the Wolfpack tradition after I'm gone," said Schmidt, referring to the nickname of boisterous Kansas City fans. "As we can see, that's not going to happen."
In custody last month, Babudar signed an affidavit upon penalty of perjury that provides a stark contrast to what he said publicly about his financial condition.
Persons in household: Homeless. Cash on hand: $ 0. Bank account: No. Other possession of value: No. Current employment: No. Last employment: Warehouse, 2020.
From jail, he declined a request for an interview unless he was paid.
"I'm currently in the process of selling my story rights," he wrote. "If The New York Times is interested in making an offer, then please feel free to let me know. Thanks for reaching out!"
A History With the Police
Babudar was first mentioned in court records in 2006, when he was 12. His father, Michael, had filed for bankruptcy in Southern California in 2004, and two years later his mother, Carla, made a filing in the case, asserting that Michael abandoned the family without a word, and that the family's home had been sold by a bankruptcy trustee. Michael Babudar did not respond to messages seeking comment, and Carla Babudar could not be reached.
Babudar, his mother and his brother appear to have traveled a difficult road.
In 2012, the three were arrested and charged with trying to use fake gift certificates to pay for food at a buffet chain in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. Babudar's records in the case aren't available because he was under 18, but his mother and brother pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace. Over the next decade, Babudar was arrested at least a half-dozen times.
In Utah, the police said, Babudar stole spoon holders and snack bags from Target, and another time switched price tags on curtain rods and then attempted to return them for full price. There are still active warrants for his arrest in both cases. He also pleaded guilty to small offenses in Kansas and Missouri. In Champlin, Minn., he was fined $ 300 for driving without a license.
His license plates said "KCC4EVR."
Babudar had more than a dozen interactions with police that did not result in arrest.
At least eight times in 2016 and 2017, the police in Overland Park, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City, had contact with Babudar. In most cases he was in a parked car with his mother and brother late at night, and a business owner found their presence suspicious. Other times they were using a hotel lobby or pool even though they were not staying at the hotel.
In police records obtained by The Times, Xaviar is described as a "jumper" who "floats from hotel to hotel." The Babudars are "known homeless subjects" and "known to do auto burglaries at night," though none of the Babudars has been convicted in Kansas of auto burglary.
In dozens of court documents and police reports over a decade, the Babudars listed just one address, a drop box in a Mail & Copy Plus office in Overland Park.
Many of Babudar's encounters with the police happened when he said online that he was attending Kansas State University, a two-hour drive from Kansas City in Manhattan, Kan. The university said it had no record of Babudar's ever attending.
Sometime in late 2017 and into 2018, Babudar's fortunes seem to have changed. He worked for nine months at an Amazon warehouse, the company confirmed, and his contact with the police and arrests drastically diminished. Soon, his identity as Chiefsaholic emerged. He first appeared on Instagram in August 2018, posting a meme about the team involving SpongeBob SquarePants. The next month, for the first time, he posted a photograph in the wolf costume.
'Shaking the Hand of a Legend'
After Babudar's arrest, Kansas City fans realized he was mostly a stranger to them.
"Nobody really knew the guy behind the mask other than the fact he would show up on game day, act crazy and take lots of pictures with people," said Matt Black, a superfan known as Almost Andy Reid.
One of the few fans who did seem to know Babudar was John Perkovich, who puts on rubber duck races in his backyard and gives away team gear to other fans. On Twitter, Babudar posted photos playing tennis with Perkovich and a voice mail message Perkovich left him after he won a big bet. But in an email, Perkovich said he socialized with Babudar only a few times and "didn't even know his last name until it got released with news of the arrest."
He added, "I was not close to him personally in any aspect."
While Babudar was not necessarily embraced by the team, he was a familiar presence. Besides being on the field at the Super Bowl and attending Mahomes's charity gala, he regularly showed up to team events and posed for photographs with players, including offensive tackle Mitchell Schwartz and the star tight end Travis Kelce.
"I might've shaken his hand in passing, but didn't even know I was shaking the hand of a legend," Kelce told the former N.F.L. player Pat McAfee on Tuesday.
Ted Crews, a team spokesman, and Marques Fitch, the director of Mahomes's foundation, did not respond to requests for comment.
A Big Bet on His Team
Now that Chiefsaholic has been unmasked as Xaviar Babudar, behaviors that were seen as quirky are beginning to make sense. Chiefsaholic frequently posted about driving, not flying, to the team's away games. And he was well known for never parking in the Arrowhead Stadium parking lot, instead walking to his car miles away. Both make a lot more sense if he was living in his car.
The question remains: How did he afford his life as Chiefsaholic? It seems unlikely he could have funded it with long-shot bets, and it's not clear where he would have gotten the money to place them.
Soon after Babudar's arrest, a photo began circulating online of a man wearing a wolf mask while robbing a bank. The thief wasn't Babudar -- the mask is different, the photo was from an Illinois bank robbery in 2016, and the police say Babudar entered the Tulsa credit union wearing a paintball mask -- but the image planted an explanation in the minds of many fans to the nagging question of how Babudar afforded his fandom: He robbed banks.
So far, though, there is no evidence that is true. Babudar has been charged with robbing only the single bank in Oklahoma, and Kevin Keller, the head of the criminal division in the Tulsa County District Attorney's office, said, "We believe this is a one-off in Oklahoma."
The F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office in Northern Oklahoma declined to comment on whether Babudar would face federal charges or if they are investigating him for other crimes. If the Tulsa case goes to trial, it is not likely to dwell on Babudar's motive. Prosecutors need only prove that he committed the crime, not why he committed it.
If funding his life as a high-rolling Kansas City fan is what got Babudar jailed in Oklahoma in the first place, then it is his life as a high-rolling fan that might eventually get him out.
Babudar apparently placed an early $ 5,000 bet on Mahomes to win the Most Valuable Player Award, for which Mahomes is a finalist, and $ 5,000 on Kansas City winning the Super Bowl. If both bets pay off -- and if Babudar is somehow able to collect while in jail -- he will win $ 100,000, and will easily be able to make his bail.
That is, if the betting slips Babudar posted on social media are real.

You Don't Get to Call Me by My Real Name: [Style Desk]

Full text: As a sex worker, I had to set boundaries with clients that I sometimes couldn't abide by myself.
Clients love to ask sex workers, "What's your real name?" It's a power move. "I know you contain multitudes" is what they mean, "and I have the right to see." They paid, after all.
The clients who asked this question of me were usually the type who had tricked themselves into believing that we had a personal relationship -- a romantic one, or a sexual one they wouldn't have to pay for had we met under different circumstances.
When clients pried, I liked turning the question back on them.
"John is my real name!" he might say, laughing at the idea that he, unlike me, would have anything to hide.
"John is my real name too," I might say with a wink.
For the better part of a decade, I was Mistress Natalie, a professional dominatrix. A teasing sense of humor was an asset on the job.
I didn't always act coy in that situation. Occasionally a client would ask for my real name, and I would answer honestly, telling them that my friends call me Chris. It was a powerless move. "I contain multitudes" is what I meant, "and don't want you to think this is all I am."
I told myself that these clients were different -- young, like me, or graduate students, like me, or queer women, like me. I needed to believe they could see the me beneath the corsets, fake eyelashes and thigh-high boots.
This was always a bad reason to tell a client my real name. There was rarely a good reason. A fake name is a boundary, and some clients have no problem pushing a sex worker's boundaries.
I still receive emails from a female client who began pursuing me obsessively after she learned my first name.
"Dear Chris: I'm going to build a house someday, and I hope you'll live in it with me."
"Dear Chris: You're the love of my life."
"Dear Mistress Natalie: When I first came to you, I was nervous and you made me feel comfortable. As I've had time to reflect, I realize that I overstepped my boundaries with you."
I try to ignore these messages, but it's hard. I'm afraid of her. My girlfriend was afraid of her, too. The client sent gifts from my Amazon Wish List, which piled up on our doorstep while I was away.
"Don't worry, baby," I said to my girlfriend. "She doesn't know my last name. She doesn't know how to find us." But I didn't know for sure.
After that girlfriend and I broke up, I was alone in my fear, which came as a relief.
Nearly a decade ago, in a hotel room in a southern city, I met a client who was another graduate student. His name really was John, and John's Ph.D. would be in computer science. Mine would be in the humanities. This explains why he had money to hire a dominatrix and I had so little that I needed to play one on the side.
When John walked into my room, I thought he was cute. When he told me all he wanted to do was kiss my leather boots, I thought, "Easy money." When he told me he had a girlfriend, I wondered why he couldn't kiss her boots for free. (Our culture really does a number on men who are interested in sexual submission.)
"What's your real name?" John asked after the session.
I didn't give him the name my friends call me, Chris, but the name my parents gave me, Christina. I told him I was a Ph.D. student like him, studying English. I contain multitudes!
With a little research, he was then able to find my last name.
When I was back home, he texted: "So, Doctor, what happens if I start developing feelings for you and want to see you on a different level?"
I ignored him.
A week later, using my full name, he made it known that he had read my academic articles, something I couldn't even convince my then girlfriend to do.
My cheeks burned as I read the text, knowing it was my own ego that had lured me into dangerous territory. I told John to call me "Mistress Natalie" but didn't block his number.
That Christmas, he texted to say that he was in Orange County visiting his parents. When I saw his number flash on my phone, I remembered that he knew my real name and didn't answer. He left angry voice mails, ranting about how I had stoked his obsession and left him hanging.
"Christina," he pleaded, "don't ruin my Christmas."
I had been working for a few years by the time I met the woman who still sends me the inappropriate emails, but I could have counted the number of female clients I had seen on one hand. I was fine with that. Female clients were more complicated. I had a harder time separating professional from personal. I had a harder time saying "no" when they asked for my real name.
In B.D.S.M. practice, "after care" is important, so I offered hugs to every client at the end of a session. It seemed like the least I could do. With that woman, I let the hugs linger. She could count on four, five cycles of breath before I would pull away. She would take more if I let her.
After our sessions, she would text me to say that the hug was her favorite part.
The last time I saw her, she had shown up to meet me in a hotel lobby -- shoeless and strung out, with no money for the session she had booked -- in a city where the police were rumored to be doing prostitution stings in high-end hotels.
Professional B.D.S.M. exists in a gray area of the law: It's not prostitution, the acceptance of money for sex, but only because sex is hard to define. I didn't think cops running a sting operation were likely to delve into the ambiguities, and I didn't need an erratic client getting me arrested. I had just defended my dissertation and was about to enter the academic job market. So I gave her cash to get her car out of the hotel parking lot where she had slept and vowed to never see her again.
At the time, I belonged to a sex worker self-defense collective. We spent hours each week drilling strategies to deflect touch. We practiced maneuvers meant to forcibly remove hands from the small of our backs, to break grips on our wrists. We talked about boundaries and how to set them.
It took the collective an hour to persuade me to stop engaging with this woman. After that morning in the hotel lobby, she had threatened to hurt herself if I didn't see her again, but I had sworn that I wouldn't.
"I can no longer have contact with you," I wrote as my support system looked on. "I wish you the best, but you have persisted in contacting me against my wishes."
I made a friend press "send." I turned off my phone for 12 hours, afraid of her response. All I could think was: She knows my real name.
Either way, I still hold my breath when I open my old work inbox, bracing myself for love declarations or worse -- that she could find out where I live, show up at my door and ask for another chance at a love she never had.
Fear is a weapon wielded by those who want to keep others silent, and the stigma against sex work makes it easy to scare or blackmail us. So finally, a few years ago, I came out as a sex worker. My name is no longer a secret to anyone. I didn't come out because I am fearless. I came out because I am sometimes still afraid, and I know I'm not alone.
In general, though, I was rarely afraid of my clients, the fumbling fathers who showed me iPhone photographs of their children and dogs, the sweet-if-clueless guys who asked for my advice on their dating profiles. Even John -- the Ph.D. student who used my real name -- called a year later when he was again home for the holidays to apologize. "I'm a fool when it comes to feelings," he wrote. "That's why I acted the way I did."
He said he was in therapy, and I agreed to see him again. He sounded sorry, I needed the money, and it was Christmas, after all.

Peruvians Take Fight To Leaders In Capital: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: They marched through the streets of Peru's capital, carrying signs that said "I'm not a terrorist" and waved rainbow-colored flags associated with Indigenous communities in the Andes. Many chant "murderer" at the country's leader and sing hymns about not being afraid anymore. On Thursday, more continued to arrive, with many vowing to stay for the long fight.
In the past week, thousands of rural Peruvians have descended on Lima to join local protests calling on President Dina Boluarte to resign following the ouster in December of the country's former leader after he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
The growing demonstrations in the capital follow seven weeks of protests around the country that show little sign of abating. Instead, Peru has found itself at an ugly impasse with the government doubling down on portraying demonstrators as pawns for drug-traffickers, illegal miners and terrorist groups who are trying to sow chaos, according to Ms. Boluarte.
Day by day, the protests seem to grow more chaotic.
The ongoing showdown has ratcheted up the polarization of the country, which has been convulsed by what is already its deadliest conflict this century.
Since Ms. Boluarte took office on Dec. 7, violent protests against her government have paralyzed large swaths of southern Peru, shutting down copper and tin mines and choking off highways leading to Lima and towns in the Amazon.
There have been at least 57 deaths related to the unrest, all outside of Lima. Forty-six civilians were killed in clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers, including 17 during a day of violent demonstrations in one southern city in Puno, a heavily Indigenous and rural region bordering Bolivia.
Daily marches in Lima, where roughly a third of the country's population of 33 million lives, have been relatively small but have grown as protesters from outside the city have arrived, many carrying sacks of grains and potatoes.
"Over there, we're killed," said Jose Hilaquita, an Indigenous Aymara farmer from Puno, explaining why he had traveled for more than two days to march in Lima. "Over there, no one listens to us. We have to come here to be seen."
The protests have been led largely by Indigenous, rural and poorer Peruvians fed up with what they portray the country's dysfunctional political system and entrenched discrimination. Many support the former leftist president, Pedro Castillo, a onetime union activist from a poor Andean town who was arrested and accused of trying to illegally seize control of Congress and the justice system on Dec. 7.
But demonstrators have also found support in Lima from some residents, while others have welcomed them with insults. Many have been invited to camp out on the grassy lawns and the squeaky gym floors of public universities. Others sleep in the offices of leftist groups or in the homes of local residents.
In Lima's working-class district of Santa Anita, Rosa Zambrano, a 74-year old retired psychologist, opened her half-finished home to 40 protesters.
After she heard they were heading to Lima, Ms. Zambrano got in touch with friends in Moquegua, the Andean region she migrated from 40 years ago, and asked how she could help.
"I couldn't bear the thought of them sleeping outside," she said as she prepared a giant pot of carapulcra, pork stewed with chiles, peanuts and potatoes, to serve the group for lunch before a demonstration. "I'm proud of the struggle of my compatriots. There is too much injustice in this country."
Food donations from residents of Lima, large and small, have helped feed protesters sheltering in large houses and at two public universities. The rector of one university opened its doors to provide refuge, while the other, San Marcos, the oldest university in the Americas, was occupied by students.
Yet, the protests have fiercely divided public opinion in Peru -- while 60 percent of rural Peruvians support them, that figure drops to less than 40 percent among Lima residents, according to a recent poll.
Some believe Ms. Boluarte has abused her executive power to quell the demonstrations, and that Peru's entrenched corruption and inequality can only be addressed with new elections and a new constitution.
But others say her resignation would only usher in more chaos and erode the already weak rule of law. "Castillo tried to do a coup and failed. Now his people are upset and want to use violence to remove the person the constitution says should replace him," said Eduardo Rivera, a business administrator in Lima. "That's not how it works."
While most protesters march peacefully, many demonstrations in southern Peru have ended in clashes with security forces and crowds vandalizing government offices. Road blockades have disrupted deliveries of food, fuel and medical oxygen.
Machu Picchu, one of the most popular destinations in Peru, has closed its doors, dealing a heavy blow to the tourism industry. The conflict has led to more than $ 500 million in losses so far, according to the government, with small businesses and some of the poorest regions hit hardest.
The authorities said that in recent days, protesters have staged simultaneous attacks on airports in southern Peru and set fire to two dozen police stations and courthouses. In the southern region of Arequipa last weekend, a crowd captured a police officer, doused him with gasoline and threatened to burn him alive unless authorities released prisoners.
In some regions, large groups of men carrying sticks dressed as civilians have appeared to help the police force protesters off roads, sparking fears of clashes between groups of civilians.
As she has struggled to gain control, Ms. Boluarte has staked out an increasingly hawkish stance, treating the crisis not as a political challenge, but mainly as a security threat.
On several occasions, she has compared the protests to one of the country's darkest chapters, a two-decade period when leftist insurgents terrorized the country and military death squads massacred civilians.
She has suggested that protesters are paid to promote the agendas of drug traffickers, illegal miners, smugglers and Bolivian leftists, and this week she claimed that protesters, not police officers, had killed other civilians during clashes. As proof, the president cited a video that she claimed showed a protester with a gun.
The government has yet to provide clear evidence to back up that claim, or claims of high-level coordination by a terrorist organization or illicit funding behind the violent attacks.
Ms. Boluarte said that violent radicals in Puno had "practically paralyzed" the entire region.
"What should we do in the face of these threats?" Ms. Boluarte said during a news conference. "Let them burn us alive? We have to protect the lives and tranquillity of 33 millions of Peruvians. Puno isn't Peru."
Within minutes, video clips of Ms. Boluarte saying "Puno isn't Peru" circulated on social media. Ms. Boluarte tweeted an apology.
On Saturday, in an extraordinary show of force, the police used a tank to tear down a gate at San Marcos University and then lined up Indigenous protesters and students face down on the concrete. Nearly 200 people were detained, and all but one were released the next day because of a lack of evidence of any wrongdoing.
"They're trying to deactivate our movement," said Brich Huanca, a university student from the city of Cusco. "She's trying to install the idea that Peru is fighting against a common enemy, against a menace to society."
Ms. Boluarte insists she will not resign but has proposed to move up elections to April 2024, a date that must be ratified by Congress with a supermajority, which many analysts say looks unlikely.
She has the support of centrist and right-wing lawmakers and most Lima-based media outlets, as well as Peruvians who blame protesters for the violence.
"Supposedly we have a democracy to avoid all of this," said Rosa Trelles, a newspaper vendor in the capital. She said relatives in a southern coastal region had been unable to work for weeks because of road blockades, and she's been struggling to afford rising food prices.
"This has gotten out of control," she said. "They want to affect businessmen, but this is affecting the people, too. They want more deaths to keep their movement alive."
Peruvians sympathetic with the now-defunct Shining Path insurgency have been spotted at protests, as they often are at demonstrations for leftist causes.
Peru is also home to large drug trafficking and illegal mining trades that employ hundreds of thousands of laborers, many of whom were sympathetic to Mr. Castillo, the ousted president, and have joined protests.
"Things aren't black and white. Peru is a country very burdened by gray areas," said Eduardo Dargent, a Peruvian political analyst.
"It's true that there are groups that want to push the situation to the limits," he added. "But none of that negates the fact that first there was discontent. That discontent is what's driving the protests, and it has a lot to do with how the government behaves."

Sundance, Once a Hotbed for Film Deals, Tries to Find Its Footing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The kind of independent movies that the festival showcases have struggled at the box office, spurring worries about what the market would be like this year.
The past two years have been a time of major upheaval in the film business -- and at the Sundance Film Festival.
Between the diminishing audiences in movie theaters, the consolidation of studios and the shrinking amount being spent on content after the streaming giants had their wrists slapped by Wall Street, few were certain about what kind of market there would be for new films at the current Sundance -- typically a hotbed of acquisitions for the brightest lights in the independent film world.
Even the festival's opening-night gala last Thursday, its first in person since 2020, felt tempered by the reality facing movies.
"These last few years have brought extraordinary challenges for our industry, along with opportunities to respond to the needs of artists and reach audiences in new ways," Sundance's chief executive, Joana Vicente, told those assembled. "And as many of this year's films illustrate, this is a moment when so much is at risk -- the health of our planet, human rights, women's rights, freedom of expression and democracy itself."
Not exactly a celebratory introduction.
So on Monday, a collective sigh of relief rose through Utah's Wasatch mountain range, where, within two hours, two high-profile films that had premiered at the festival found eager buyers. Netflix plunked down $ 20 million to take the worldwide rights to the thriller "Fair Play," while Searchlight Pictures spent just under $ 8 million for the musical-theater-geek mockumentary "Theater Camp," starring Ben Platt.
A day later, Apple TV+ nabbed the musical drama "Flora & Son" for $ 20 million, and the indie distributor A24 bought the Australian horror film "Talk to Me" for a wide theatrical release this summer.
Despite the deals, the state of movies and how audiences will watch them remained an underlying worry.
"Everybody is wringing their hands about the industry," said Vinay Singh, the chief executive of Archer Gray, a production company whose film "The Persian Version" was shown in competition at Sundance. "A lot of people have lost their jobs. There are cost-cutting measures happening on spending content. People are worried."
Indeed, no one seems to know any longer what kind of movie is worthy of theatrical release and what should be sent straight to a streaming service. Distribution and marketing executives have to figure out not only how to sell a movie to an increasingly fickle audience but also how to navigate the needs of corporate parents, often giant conglomerates whose business priorities are constantly in flux.
Plus, there is always the fear of succumbing to "Sundance Fever"-- making lightheaded decisions because of the high-altitude fervor of the audience. Over the decades, both streaming services and theatrical distributors have overpaid for films at the festival. Harvey Weinstein spent $ 10 million for "Happy, Texas" in 1999 only to see it flop at the box office. Focus Features paid $ 10 million for "Hamlet 2" in 2008, and in 2019, Amazon scooped up three movies for a combined $ 41 million while New Line paid $ 15 million for "Blinded by the Light," only to have it gross $ 12 million. And that was when the industry was healthier.
Now, with so much riding on every decision, a positive response to a film at Sundance is no longer enough to guarantee that it will attract a theatrical distribution deal.
"I'd like to believe this movie could have done well in theaters," said Ram Bergman, a producer of "Fair Play," one of the festival's most acclaimed and sought-after films. But despite the enthusiasm from the traditional studios, he said, there was little faith that the $ 5 million R-rated thriller, starring Phoebe Dynevor ("Bridgerton") and Alden Ehrenreich ("Solo: A Star Wars Story"), could succeed opposite the superhero spectacles without a prohibitively expensive marketing budget.
"You are dealing with a lot of the studios that have convinced themselves that these movies cannot really do well in theaters," Mr. Bergman said. "It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. And if a streamer, let's say Netflix, really wants to get behind it and treat it as one of, like, their high-priority movies, it's hard to compete."
Therein lies the challenge. Most filmmakers come to Sundance with the expectation that their film will be shown on big screens across the country. The reality is that their movies are exactly the kinds that are performing poorly at the box office: small, inexpensive, complex and lacking movie stars.
Add the fact that independent chains like ArcLight Cinemas and Landmark Theatres, which were the traditional supporters of indie fare, have closed locations and the calculus required to make these films successful becomes even more challenging.
Searchlight is counting on fans of Mr. Platt ("Dear Evan Hansen") and live theater in general to power "Theater Camp," which celebrates all those who dream of hitting it big on Broadway. The thinking goes that if Mr. Platt can sell out Madison Square Garden, as he has with his one-man show, he can draw audiences to a movie theater. (However, Mr. Platt's last film endeavor, the adaptation of "Dear Evan Hansen," grossed only $ 15 million at the domestic box office.)
"This is a crowd-pleasing movie, and it was designed with an audience in mind from inception," said Erik Feig, chief executive of PictureStart, one of the producers of "Theater Camp." "Yet we didn't mitigate our risk with presales. We took a flier. We did our research into the market, but comparisons change like every 90 seconds, so you kind of build something for a business model that two weeks later is extinct."
Other buzzy projects did not generate the kind of sales that Sundance, which ends on Sunday, is normally known for. "Cat Person" pleased crowds at the festival, but the critics excoriated it, particularly for veering away from the viral New Yorker short story it was based on. "Magazine Dreams" features an Oscar-caliber performance by Jonathan Majors ("Lovecraft Country"), but he plays a character who spirals into madness and begins carrying a loaded gun -- a particularly difficult film to buy in the wake of the two recent mass shootings in California.
And the documentary "Justice," which turns an investigative eye toward Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh's Supreme Court appointment and was added to the festival's lineup at the last minute with much fanfare, disappointed critics, too.
The "Justice" filmmakers say they have received new tips, since their film was announced, that they plan to follow up on. It's just not clear that the film, which was self-funded by the director, Doug Liman, who is best known for glossy action movies, will find a distributor ready to back an incomplete project.
Despite the challenges, people were thrilled to be back in person at Sundance.
"I feel a deep sense of gratitude to be in this room watching a movie," Davis Guggenheim said at the premiere of his documentary "Still," about Michael J. Fox and his protracted battle with Parkinson's disease.
"Theater Camp" brought its actors onstage to perform. The documentary "Going Varsity in Mariachi" was supplemented by a live performance by Mariachi Juvenil de Utah, and the cast of "Flora & Son" rapped one of its songs. The screenings were often sold out, and a film's reception could be judged on the spot by the number of standing ovations it received. Still, buyers were being much more selective.
"I think it's natural that we're seeing things not happen overnight," Mr. Singh of Archer Gray said. "I think that's fine. I actually think it might be a sign of health, because there's so much stuff in play."
Mr. Feig echoed that sentiment.
"It's definitely a challenging market," he said. "For each of these movies that has landed buyers, there probably weren't 25 different offers for each one of these. There may be more of a handful. You just have to kind of build them sensibly knowing what your potential options are."
He also noted the festival's combination of established names and rising talent, adding with more than a dash of optimism: "This is why Sundance is so amazing -- it's a discovery of fresh new voices. You saw that with 'Fair Play.' You see it with 'Talk to Me.' You saw that with 'Theater Camp.' All brand-new filmmakers, with their very first movie, and they broke through, they made noise, and they found studio partners."

LIMA, Peru — They marched through the streets of Peru’s capital, carrying signs that said “I’m not a terrorist” and waved rainbow-colored flags associated with Indigenous communities in the Andes. Many chant “murderer” at the country’s leader and sing hymns about not being afraid anymore. On Thursday, more continued to arrive, with many vowing to stay for the long fight.
In the past week, thousands of rural Peruvians have descended on Lima to join local protests calling on President Dina Boluarte to resign following the ouster in December of the country’s former leader after he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
The growing demonstrations in the capital follow seven weeks of protests around the country that show little sign of abating.

Day by day, the protests seem to grow more chaotic.
The ongoing showdown has ratcheted up the polarization of the country, which has been convulsed by what is already its deadliest conflict this century.
Since Boluarte took office Dec. 7, violent protests against her government have paralyzed large swaths of southern Peru, shutting down copper and tin mines and choking off highways leading to Lima and towns in the Amazon.
There have been at least 57 deaths related to the unrest, all outside of Lima. Forty-six civilians were killed in clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers, including 17 during a day of violent demonstrations in one southern city in Puno, a heavily Indigenous and rural region bordering Bolivia.

Many have been invited to camp out on the grassy lawns and the squeaky gym floors of public universities. Others sleep in the offices of leftist groups or in the homes of local residents.
In Lima’s working-class district of Santa Anita, Rosa Zambrano, 74, a retired psychologist, opened her half-finished home to 40 protesters.
After she heard they were heading to Lima, Zambrano got in touch with friends in Moquegua, the Andean region she migrated from 40 years ago, and asked how she could help.
“I couldn’t bear the thought of them sleeping outside,” she said as she prepared a giant pot of carapulcra, pork stewed with chiles, peanuts and potatoes, to serve the group for lunch before a demonstration. “I’m proud of the struggle of my compatriots. There is too much injustice in this country.”
Food donations from residents of Lima, large and small, have helped feed protesters sheltering in large houses and at two public universities. The rector of one university opened its doors to provide refuge, while the other, San Marcos, the oldest university in the Americas, was occupied by students.
Yet, the protests have fiercely divided public opinion in Peru; while 60% of rural Peruvians support them, that figure drops to less than 40% among Lima residents, according to a recent poll.
Some believe Boluarte has abused her executive power to quell the demonstrations and that Peru’s entrenched corruption and inequality can only be addressed with new elections and a new constitution.
But others say her resignation would only usher in more chaos and erode the already weak rule of law. “Castillo tried to do a coup and failed. Now his people are upset and want to use violence to remove the person the constitution says should replace him,” said Eduardo Rivera, a business administrator in Lima. “That’s not how it works.”
While most protesters march peacefully, many demonstrations in southern Peru have ended in clashes with security forces and crowds vandalizing government offices. Road blockades have disrupted deliveries of food, fuel and medical oxygen.
Machu Picchu, one of the most popular destinations in Peru, has closed its doors, dealing a heavy blow to the tourism industry. The conflict has led to more than $500 million in losses so far, according to the government, with small businesses and some of the poorest regions hit hardest.
Authorities said that in recent days, protesters have staged simultaneous attacks on airports in southern Peru and set fire to two dozen police stations and courthouses. In the southern region of Arequipa last weekend, a crowd captured a police officer, doused him with gasoline and threatened to burn him alive unless authorities released prisoners.
In some regions, large groups of men carrying sticks dressed as civilians have appeared to help the police force protesters off roads, sparking fears of clashes between groups of civilians.
As she has struggled to gain control, Boluarte has staked out an increasingly hawkish stance, treating the crisis not as a political challenge but mainly as a security threat.
On several occasions, she has compared the protests to one of the country’s darkest chapters, a two-decade period when leftist insurgents terrorized the country and military death squads massacred civilians.
She has suggested that protesters are paid to promote the agendas of drug traffickers, illegal miners, smugglers and Bolivian leftists, and this week she claimed that protesters, not police officers, had killed other civilians during clashes. As proof, the president cited a video that she said showed a protester with a gun.
The government has yet to provide clear evidence to back up that claim, or claims of high-level coordination by a terrorist organization or illicit funding behind the violent attacks.
Boluarte said that violent radicals in Puno had “practically paralyzed” the entire region.
“What should we do in the face of these threats?” Boluarte said during a news conference. “Let them burn us alive? We have to protect the lives and tranquility of 33 millions of Peruvians. Puno isn’t Peru.”
Within minutes, video clips of Boluarte saying, “Puno isn’t Peru,” circulated on social media. Boluarte tweeted an apology.
On Saturday, in an extraordinary show of force, the police used a tank to tear down a gate at San Marcos University and then lined up Indigenous protesters and students facedown on the concrete. Nearly 200 people were detained, and all but one were released the next day because of a lack of evidence of any wrongdoing.
“They’re trying to deactivate our movement,” said Brich Huanca, a university student from the city of Cusco. “She’s trying to install the idea that Peru is fighting against a common enemy, against a menace to society.”
Boluarte insists she will not resign but has proposed to move up elections to April 2024, a date that must be ratified by Congress with a supermajority, which many analysts say looks unlikely.
She has the support of centrist and right-wing lawmakers and most Lima-based media outlets, as well as Peruvians who blame protesters for the violence.
“Supposedly we have a democracy to avoid all of this,” said Rosa Trelles, a newspaper vendor in the capital. She said relatives in a southern coastal region had been unable to work for weeks because of road blockades, and she’s been struggling to afford rising food prices.
“This has gotten out of control,” she said. “They want to affect businessmen, but this is affecting the people, too. They want more deaths to keep their movement alive.”
Peruvians sympathetic with the now-defunct Shining Path insurgency have been spotted at protests, as they often are at demonstrations for leftist causes.
Peru is also home to large drug trafficking and illegal mining trades that employ hundreds of thousands of laborers, many of whom were sympathetic to Castillo, the ousted president, and have joined protests.
“Things aren’t black and white. Peru is a country very burdened by gray areas,” said Eduardo Dargent, a Peruvian political analyst.
“It’s true that there are groups that want to push the situation to the limits,” he added. “But none of that negates the fact that first there was discontent. That discontent is what’s driving the protests, and it has a lot to do with how the government behaves.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Cutting Jobs, Retail Braces For a Slump: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Companies that ramped up hiring in areas like technology over the past few years are cutting back as customers slow their spending.
The retail industry is trying to figure out its correct size.
Retailers, faced with sky-high demand from shoppers during the pandemic, spent the past three years ramping up their operations in areas like human resources, finance and technology. Now, times have changed.
A public that rushed to buy all sorts of goods in the earlier parts of the pandemic is now spending less on merchandise like furniture and clothing. E-commerce, which boomed during lockdowns, has fallen from those heights. And with consumers worried about inflation in the prices of day-to-day necessities like food, companies are playing defense.
Saks Off 5th, the off-price retailer owned by Hudson Bay, laid off an unspecified number of workers on Tuesday. Saks.com is laying off about 100 employees, or 3.5 percent of its workers. Stitch Fix laid off 20 percent of its salaried workers this month and closed a distribution center in Salt Lake City. Last week, Wayfair said it would lay off 1,750 people, or 10 percent of its work force, and Amazon started laying off 18,000 workers, many of them in its retail division. Bed Bath & Beyond cut its work force this month as it tries to shore up its finances and prepares for a possible bankruptcy filing.
While it's not unusual for major retailers to announce store closings and some job cuts after the blitz of the holiday season, the recent spate of layoffs is more about structural changes as the industry recalibrates itself after the rapid growth from pandemic-fueled shopping. And it accompanies broader worries about the state of the U.S. economy and layoffs by prominent tech companies.
"Retailers are really being cognizant of capital preservation," said Catherine Lepard, who leads the global retail market for the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles. "They don't know how long this cooler economy is going to last, and they want to make sure they have the right cash to get through that. For retailers that are struggling, it really means tightening the belt with some cost cutting."
Sales during the all-important holiday shopping season were weaker than in years past, when growth hit record levels. December retail sales increased 6 percent from the same period last year, but that number was not adjusted for inflation, which was at 6.5 percent.
Department stores posted sizable sales declines. At Nordstrom, sales in the last nine weeks of 2022 decreased 3.5 percent from a year earlier, with the company noting that they "were softer than prepandemic levels." Macy's said its holiday sales had been on the lower end of its expectations.
The layoffs at certain retail companies are a sign that the industry is bracing for a slowdown and another change in how people shop.
"To mitigate macroeconomic headwinds and best position our business for success, we have made changes to streamline our organizational structure," Meghan Biango, a spokesperson for Saks Off 5th, said in a statement. "As part of this, we made the difficult decision to part ways with associates across various areas of the business." The layoffs affected divisions such as talent acquisition and supply chain.
Not all retailers are in a defensive crouch. For instance, Walmart announced this week that it was raising the minimum wage for its store employees in a bid to attract and retain workers in a tight labor market.
Still, some retailers are becoming focused less on bringing in new customers -- an expensive undertaking -- and more on retaining those they gained during the pandemic.
"There's a sense of conservatism," said Brian Walker, chief strategy officer at Bloomreach, which works with retailers on their e-commerce and digital marketing businesses. "They're still adjusting in many ways to this omnichannel retail environment and are probably seeing this as an important time to calibrate their organizations and make sure they have the right people, and not too many of them to be pragmatic and weather a potential storm."
That means fewer projects that require lots of money and time and more investments where a company can start seeing results quickly, Mr. Walker said.
Ms. Lepard agreed. "This isn't the economy to really get creative and take on high risk," she said. "There might be a pulling back of some of that innovation in future investment to make sure they're pacing themselves."
It's also a moment for retailers to assess what e-commerce abilities they need. In the early months of the pandemic, online sales exploded as many brick-and-mortar stores went dark. That growth has slowed. E-commerce traffic in North America declined 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2022 compared with a year earlier, according to Bloomreach's Commerce Pulse data. Conversion rates -- the measure of someone's buying an item after seeing it advertised -- dropped 12 percent during the same period.
"This is where people overshot the runway," said Craig Johnson, president of the retail advisory firm Customer Growth Partners, who has tracked the industry for 25 years. "This works like a ratchet. It might go up to 27 percent, but that's going to normalize," he added, referring to the share of total e-commerce spending for the first year of the pandemic, when many stores were grappling with Covid restrictions and closures.
When online spending was rising, many companies pushed to fill roles that could help them meet the demand. Now they have to adjust to a new reality.
"Unfortunately, along the way, we overcomplicated things, lost sight of some of our fundamentals and simply grew too big," Niraj Shah, Wayfair's chief executive, said in a note to employees last Friday. His company, which reported in November that its net revenue was down 9 percent from a year earlier, is looking to save $ 1.4 billion.
In the luxury sector, the shopper demand is still there, but a restructuring is needed to continue to innovate. As part of its layoffs, Saks.com also separated its technology and operations teams.
"We are at a point in our trajectory as a digital luxury pure-play where we need to optimize our business to ensure we are best positioned for the future," Nicole Schoenberg, a Saks spokeswoman, said in a statement. "These changes are never easy, but they are necessary for our go-forward success."
While reducing head count might help save costs in the short term, retailers will have trouble in the future if they do not also address how to improve the customer experience online, said Liza Amlani, founder of Retail Strategy Group, which works with brands on their merchandising and planning strategies.
"With Wayfair, and as with many digital players, what we've seen in the last three years is that they scaled and grew too quickly," Ms. Amlani said. "They banked on an influx of spending across digital. They didn't invest where they needed to invest."
The retail layoffs are an about-face from 2021, when companies couldn't hire frontline workers fast enough. After the initial jolt of the pandemic, which led many retailers to furlough or outright fire workers, many people received stimulus checks from the government. They wanted to spend that money, and when companies needed to ramp up in-store services again, they often struggled to find enough workers.
Recalling that difficulty might give some retailers pause before they lay off workers this time, Mr. Walker said. If a steep downturn never comes, or if there's a sudden rebound in demand, companies don't want to be stuck without enough employees.
But the next few months could be rough for retailers, as profit margins shrink and revenue growth slows from what it was the past couple of years. In that kind of environment, investors generally like to see large companies take steps to cut costs. And once layoffs begin, a kind of industry groupthink can set in.
"Once a couple of companies start to do it," said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who researches management and human resources, "then it creates some momentum where then you've got to explain why you're not doing what everybody else is doing."

Laid Off in Your Living Room: The Chaos of Remote Job Cuts

Kerensa Cadenas opened Slack on Friday morning to an expletive-laden message from a colleague that said essentially: “I got let go.” Cadenas, steeling herself, checked her email. Then she typed out her own expletive. She’d been laid off, too. Alone in her New York City apartment.
Cadenas, with more than 100 of her Vox Media colleagues as well as thousands of other workers this week and last, was submerged in a lonely, surreal wave of remote layoffs. People got the news through emails, Slack messages or video calls, then sent their goodbye notes and powered down their computers, with no teammates around to commiserate over beer.
“Normally you’re like, ‘OK, I can go get drunk,’” said Cadenas, 37, noting that atop the isolation comes frustration with the instability that so many media workers have now come to accept as a fact of their working lives. “It’s scary because I’m like: ‘Will I ever have a savings account? Am I ever going to own something? Probably not.’”
This month, angst has rippled across laptop screens, with dozens of companies announcing mass layoffs and even the most large and well-established workplaces finding distinct ways to breed extra chaos in the process. More than 1,000 tech companies laid off nearly 160,000 workers last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, which is tracking job cuts across the industry, and another 185 companies have cut some 57,000 tech workers since the start of this year.
Layoffs are among the most challenging life experiences, causing more psychological stress than even divorce, according to one study. Losing a job can upend workers’ finances and their sense of self, and layoffs in the world of remote work have in many cases been especially destabilizing, with employer missteps fueling uncertainty and unnecessary unknowns.
At Twitter, employees were notified in the middle of the night that they had been laid off, and at least one worker found out during a team call when that person lost access to company accounts. At the mortgage lending company Better.com, Rena Starr, 33, missed a short and unexpected Zoom meeting in 2021, then texted her boss to learn she and more than 900 of her colleagues had been fired during it. In a later round of job cuts at Better.com, last year, some employees there learned they had been laid off when severance pay hit their payroll accounts; this was months after the chief executive had apologized for summarily firing nearly 10% of the company’s employees in a roughly three-minute call just before the holidays.
“They’re immediately cutting you off from your technological connection,” said Sandra Sucher, a professor of management at Harvard who has studied layoffs for more than a decade. “I’ve been hearing of a number of companies where people were in the middle of things and couldn’t continue and didn’t know who to address.”
Many laid off workers are left with a long list of questions and an utter lack of clarity about who can help them. A recruiter at Amazon was told within four months of starting her job that it would almost certainly be cut, and she was encouraged to accept a severance package. She had to mail back her company computer and doesn’t have a personal one, making it challenging to search for a new job.
At some companies, people noted that their teammates were far more helpful than their employers after a layoff. Shortly after losing her job at an e-commerce marketing company in November, Erika Kwee, 32, heard from a colleague who had crowdsourced a list of opportunities and recruiter contacts to help Kwee navigate her search process.
But many remote workers don’t even have their colleagues’ phone numbers, and they don’t know who to go to for comfort or information. Beth Anstandig, a psychotherapist in the Bay Area, is seeing her clients bear the mental toll of this period.
“I hear that people are not sleeping, or sleeping two hours at a time on their couches,” said Anstandig, who is currently working with both clients conducting layoffs and those experiencing them, many of whom are distressed and overworked. “They’re in tears during our meetings together.”
Millions of American workers have never known a world without the specter of mass layoffs. That kind of instability has characterized the economy since the late 1970s and ’80s, when the notion of prioritizing shareholders above all else took root and companies embraced the strategy of growing fast and then cutting down quick. Some executives rushed to frame that tumult as intrinsic to corporate life: In 1996, Robert Eaton, chief executive of Chrysler Corp., said that downsizing and layoffs are part of the price of becoming more competitive.”. Now 85% of workers rank job loss as a top concern, according to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer.
Last year ended with job cuts across tech behemoths: Meta laid off more than 11,000 workers, or about 13% of its workforce, and Lyft laid off 13% of its workers. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said last week it plans to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global workforce; Microsoft plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or 5% of its employees; and Spotify this week said it would cut 6% of its workforce. For many of these companies, these cuts followed years of free-flowing perks and flexible work arrangements that were part of what was called a “war for talent.”
“That is one of the great contradictions of corporate life,” Sucher said. “All corporations say ‘People are our most important asset,’ but they don’t really seem to believe that.”
“Calling someone ‘talent’ is quite different from calling them a person,” she added. “People aren’t a resource that can be depleted over time.”
Trip Barnes, 39, who works in Atlanta, has been laid off three times in the past three years, each experience bringing pangs of grief in a different form. In spring 2020, for example, he got an 8 a.m. call from his longtime boss and was quickly told that he was being laid off from his hospitality staffing role and would be hearing from human resources about the details later that morning.
“Everybody in the moment is trying to get out of the conversation — get it done quickly,” Barnes said. “It was all about ripping the Band-Aid off.”
Two weeks ago, he rewatched his favorite movie, “Up in the Air,” a 2009 film that follows a character played by George Clooney whose job is to ax people from corporations. Barnes resonated, painfully, with the treatment of workers as interchangeable and expendable.
And in some industries, especially media, many workers voiced a sense of resignation with the layoffs that swept their workplaces this month.
Phoebe Gavin, 37, who ran talent and development for Vox.com, said she wasn’t surprised when she found out Friday that she had lost her job. Ever since her role was cut at the storytelling website Upworthy in 2015, Gavin has been preparing for bouts of unemployment. She has put 10% of every paycheck into her savings account, building a nest egg. In 2019, she started a coaching business, which she devoted her Saturdays and early mornings to building, because she wanted to have a backup plan in case she had to deal with losing a job again.
“I don’t have any expectation for any company I work for to prioritize my interests,” Gavin said.
But management experts stress that businesses don’t have to navigate periods of economic turbulence so haphazardly.
Sucher noted that Nokia, when it was restructuring in 2011, gave the roughly 18,000 people who would be affected about a year of advance notice and offered them several pathways forward: The company would help them find new roles internally, get new jobs externally, start their own businesses or begin an educational program, among other options.
Nokia’s success metrics were whether people had a job lined up when they left the firm, and whether they were leaving with a positive enough impression that they would be open to returning in the future. Nearly two-thirds of people who left knew what their next steps would be.
“This is going to be the lasting impression that sticks with your previous employees, your current employees and all future employees,” said Tanner Hackett, chief executive of Counterpart, an insurance technology company that helps small businesses.
Hackett said companies frequently take a rushed approach to layoffs, as their shareholders watch other industry layoffs happening and expect the same, which contributes to a climate of alarm and also leaves employers open to being sued for wrongful termination or violations of the WARN Act, a 1998 labor law that requires large businesses to give advance notice of mass layoffs. In recent weeks, Hackett has watched some companies move reactively instead of purposefully in responding to the economic downturn.
Briana Boehmer, 44, drove to her office in Boulder, Colorado, on Jan. 18 for what she thought was a normal executive meeting at the fitness technology company where she was the chief operating officer and had spent nearly six years working long hours and weekends to support customers. When the meeting started, the founders seemed nervous.
After a few unclear minutes, the chief technology officer jumped in: “So are you saying we’re terminated?”
It was a peculiar moment for Boehmer, who had spent recent months following the news about chaotic layoffs at other tech companies.
“I’ve been hearing it on these podcasts and being like, ‘Oh that’s a shame, that’s a terrible way to do it,’” she said. “And then I’m like, ‘Oh, that just happened to me.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

U.S. Accuses Google of Abusing Its Monopoly: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit, which a group of states joined, was the fifth by U.S. officials against the company since 2020.
The Justice Department and a group of eight states sued Google on Tuesday, accusing it of illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology that powers online advertising, in the agency's first antitrust lawsuit against a tech giant under President Biden and an escalation in legal pressure on one of the world's biggest internet companies.
The lawsuit said Google had "corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers and brokers to facilitate digital advertising."
The lawsuit asked U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to force Google to sell much of its suite of ad technology products, which include software for buying and selling ads, a marketplace to complete the transactions and a service for showcasing the ads across the internet. The lawsuit also asked the court to stop the company from engaging in allegedly anticompetitive practices.
It is the fifth antitrust lawsuit filed by U.S. officials against Google since 2020, as lawmakers and regulators around the world try to rein in the power that big tech companies exert over information and commerce online. In Europe, Amazon, Google, Apple and others have faced antitrust investigations and charges, while regulators have passed new laws to limit social media's harms and some practices such as data collection.
In the United States, Google has faced particular scrutiny. In 2020, a group of states led by Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit against it involving advertising technology, while the Justice Department and another group of states separately sued Google over claims that it abused its dominance over online search. In 2021, some states also sued over the company's app store practices.
The new lawsuit "adds another important complication to Google's efforts to deal with regulators worldwide," said William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. "There's a chance one or more of these challenges is going to make its way through and hit the target."
Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesman, said the lawsuit "attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector." It echoes the "unfounded" lawsuit led by Texas in 2020, he said, adding that the Justice Department's latest suit makes a flawed argument that would slow innovation and harm publishers.
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said monopolies "threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based." He added, "We will aggressively protect consumers, safeguard competition and work to ensure economic fairness and opportunity for all."
The Biden administration is trying to use uncommon legal theories to clip the wings of some of America's largest businesses. The F.T.C. recently asked a judge to block Meta from buying a virtual-reality start-up, a rare case that argues a deal could harm potential competition in a nascent market. The agency has also challenged Microsoft's $ 69 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, a notable action because the two companies are not primarily seen as direct competitors.
These efforts are expected to meet fierce resistance in federal courts. Judges have for decades subscribed to a view that antitrust violations should mostly be determined by whether they increase prices for consumers. But Jonathan Kanter, the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, have said they are willing to lose cases that allow them to stretch the boundaries of the law and that put corporate America on notice.
The lawsuit on Tuesday describes a campaign by Google to monopolize advertising technology and then abuse that dominance, to the detriment of publishers, advertisers and ultimately consumers.
The Justice Department and the states, which include New York and California, said Google had built its monopoly by buying up crucial tools that delivered ads to publishers. As a result, advertisers paid more for space on the internet and publishers made less money, as Google took its cut, they said.
"Each time a threat has emerged, Google has used its market power in one or more of these ad tech tools to quash the threat," the lawsuit said. "The result: Google's plan for durable, industrywide dominance has succeeded."
The Justice Department described internal Google documents and other evidence that it believes could help prove its case. In the lawsuit, the agency said one Google advertising executive had questioned the company's market power, asking if there was "a deeper issue with us owning the platform, the exchange and a huge network" and adding that "the analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the" New York Stock Exchange.
The lawsuit echoes claims made in the 2020 lawsuit backed by Texas and 14 other states and territories over Google's ad technology. That lawsuit has had a mixed reception in court. In September, a federal judge in New York ruled that some of the case could go forward, but dismissed a claim involving a deal between Google and Facebook that the states said was anticompetitive.
Google's search engine has long been its profit center, but its ad tech division has helped cement its place as a one-stop shop for advertisers. The two businesses together have given the company a powerful advantage in setting the price of online ads. Because Google's various ad tools and platforms are closely integrated, a forced divestiture could be a painful and difficult process for the company.
Alphabet, Google's parent company, is scheduled to report financial results for the fourth quarter on Feb. 2, amid a downturn in the online advertising market.
Google has added to its online advertising tools for years. Its $ 3.1 billion purchase in 2007 of DoubleClick, a maker of ad tools, amplified the reach of its already powerful digital advertising machine. DoubleClick gave Google a crucial role on the internet, providing a marketplace for publishers and letting Google host more ads on sites across the web.
At the time, Google had $ 16.6 billion in annual revenue, primarily from its search engine business. By 2021, the company's advertising technology division generated $ 31.7 billion in revenue, making it the second-largest business unit after the flagship search engine. Through the first three quarters of 2022, the unit posted $ 24.3 billion in sales.
Google has long faced accusations from online publishers that its control over the digital ads ecosystem unfairly sapped profits from the sites where the ads are displayed.
One group representing publishers, including The New York Times Company, has pushed Congress to allow the sites to negotiate the terms of ad deals collectively with Google and other online platforms. Normally, that kind of coordination would be illegal under antitrust laws. The publishers' efforts have been unsuccessful so far.
The Justice Department said that besides harming publishers and advertisers, Google's tight control of the ad tech market hurt internet users, arguing that publishers have fewer resources to create content for visitors of their websites.
On Friday, Google announced that it would lay off 12,000 employees, or 6 percent of its work force, in response to a slowdown in the digital advertising market. The company said the cuts would allow it to prioritize projects involving artificial intelligence, an area that has picked up steam in Silicon Valley in recent months.

Oscar-Picking Strategy: Everything All at Once: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a year when moviegoers returned en masse to big-budget spectacles -- and skipped nearly everything else -- Oscar voters on Tuesday spread nominations remarkably far and wide. Three blockbusters made the best picture cut, eight films received at least five nominations and first-time nominees filled 16 of the 20 acting slots.
"It's a broad group, which is thrilling and evidence of a changing academy," said Gail Berman, a producer of "Elvis," which received eight nominations, including one for best picture. "I'm particularly thrilled that there are populist movies like ours in there. They're big and they're fun -- Baz Luhrmann is the very DNA of 'Elvis' -- and they remind people what they love about going to the movies."
The universe-hopping "Everything Everywhere All at Once" had the most nominations, with 11, including ones for best picture, actress (Michelle Yeoh), supporting actress (Stephanie Hsu), supporting actor (Ke Huy Quan) and director (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert). "The Banshees of Inisherin," a dark comedy about a frayed friendship, and the German-language "All Quiet on the Western Front" each had nine; they were also recognized for best picture.
The blockbuster sequels "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Avatar: The Way of Water," with $ 3.5 billion in combined ticket sales worldwide, were included in the best picture category. An ultrasophisticated drama ("Tár"), a memory piece from Steven Spielberg ("The Fabelmans"), a sexual assault drama set in an isolated religious community ("Women Talking") and a satire of the wealthy from a Swedish filmmaker ("Triangle of Sadness") filled out the category.
In some ways, the widely spread nominations reflected the jumbled state of Hollywood. No one in the movie capital seems to know which end is up, with streaming services like Netflix hot then not, and studios unsure about how many films to release in theaters and whether anything but superheroes, sequels and horror stories can succeed.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has about 10,000 members, has also worked to diversify its ranks by gender, race and nationality. The inclusion of multiple blockbusters could signal that voting members of have finally decided to help the Oscars show by widening the best picture aperture. In 2009, academy leaders expanded the nominee pool to 10 from five. The audience for the ceremony was in decline, and more slots would make room for a broader range of films, perhaps even populist movies -- or so academy officials hoped. Voters had mostly just doubled down on little-seen art films.
The 2022 show drew 16.6 million viewers, the second-worst turnout on record after the pandemic-affected 2021 telecast. If the Nielsen ratings do not improve, the academy faces a financial precipice: Most of its revenue comes from the sale of broadcasting rights to the show. Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake.
ABC will broadcast the 95th ceremony live on March 12.
Seven actors of color receive nominations
The #OscarsSoWhite outcries from 2015 and 2016, prompted by all-white slates of acting nominees, continue to reverberate at the academy, which has been trying to diversify its membership by race, gender and nationality. In 2021, nine of the 20 acting nominations went to people of color. Last year, it was four.
This time around seven actors of color were nominated. Yeoh was chosen for the best actress lineup for playing a Chinese immigrant who discovers that she can jump between universes in "Everything Everywhere All at Once." Ana de Armas nabbed a nomination for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in the polarizing "Blonde."
In a surprise, Danielle Deadwyler ("Till") and Viola Davis ("The Woman King") were both omitted from the best actress category.
Yeoh's co-star Quan ("Everything Everywhere") received a supporting actor nomination. The former child actor is a favorite in the field, which also includes Brian Tyree Henry, for his role as a mechanic suffering trauma after an auto accident in "Causeway."
Angela Bassett became the first actress in a Marvel movie to receive a nomination, for her regal "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" performance. She was joined by Stephanie Hsu, for her role as Yeoh's daughter in "Everything Everywhere," and Hong Chau, who played a stern caregiver in "The Whale." Left out were Dolly de Leon, for her scene-stealing role as a cleaner on a luxury cruise ship in "Triangle of Sadness," and Janelle Monáe, for her two roles in "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery."
The only person of color in the directing category was Daniel Kwan ("Everything Everywhere"), who was recognized along with his partner, Daniel Scheinert. All of the other nominees were white men. For decades, women and people of color were almost entirely excluded from the directing race. In 2021, for the first time, two women were nominated: Chloé Zhao ("Nomadland") and Emerald Fennell ("Promising Young Woman"), with Zhao winning. Last year, Jane Campion ("The Power of the Dog") won the Oscar for directing.
This year, Sarah Polley ("Women Talking") was left out even though her film was nominated for best picture. (Polley received a nomination for best adapted screenplay.) "The Woman King," directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and starring Davis, was snubbed completely by the academy, as was "Till," which was directed by Chinonye Chukwu, a Nigerian American.
Mandy Walker became the third woman ever nominated for best cinematographer, for her work on "Elvis," following Rachel Morrison ("Mudbound") and Ari Wegner ("The Power of the Dog"). No woman has ever won.
Netflix takes a back seat
For the last three years, Netflix has received more Oscar nominations than any other company, underscoring the rise of streaming services in Hollywood, especially as a platform for sophisticated films. This year, however, Netflix lost the most-nominated crown to the Walt Disney Company, in part because two high-profile Netflix movies -- "White Noise" and "Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths" -- failed to gain much traction with critics and film festival audiences.
Disney-owned studios are behind "Avatar: The Way of Water" (20th Century), "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" (Marvel) and "The Banshees of Inisherin" (Searchlight). Those three films collected a combined 18 nominations. In total, Disney racked up 22 nominations, including one for Pixar's "Turning Red," recognized for best animated film, and the volcano exploration film "Fire of Love" (National Geographic), which will compete in the best documentary race.
Netflix scored 16 (down from 27 last year), with the brutal "All Quiet on the Western Front" leading the way. In addition to de Armas's best actress nod for Netflix's controversy-stirring "Blonde," Guillermo del Toro's lavishly campaigned "Pinocchio" and "The Sea Beast" were nominated for best animated film. And "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery" got a nod for Rian Johnson's adapted screenplay. ("Bardo" did receive one nomination, for best cinematography.)
Among the other big streaming services, Amazon's Prime Video received one nomination, for "Argentina, 1985" as best international film. Apple TV+ had two, including the surprise nomination of Brian Tyree Henry, for his supporting role in "Causeway," about the psychological toll of war.
Don't expect to see Will Smith
Will Smith, the reigning best actor winner, remains eligible to win Oscars (in absentia), and his team had hoped that academy voters would be so blown away by his volcanic performance in "Emancipation" that they would at least nominate him. Set during the Civil War and directed by Antoine Fuqua, "Emancipation" stars Smith as a man who escapes slavery and joins the Union Army to fight against his former captors. It arrived on Apple TV+ in December.
But it appears that Smith remains too toxic following his behavior at last year's ceremony, when he marched onstage and slapped Chris Rock. "Emancipation" has been largely ignored by awards organizations, including Hollywood guilds, and the Oscars followed suit on Tuesday. None of the other artists involved in "Emancipation," including Fuqua, fared any better.
As a result, Apple TV+ is only a minor player at the 2023 Oscars -- a wild swing from last year, when Apple triumphed with "CODA," which became the first film from a streaming service to be named best picture.
The ceremony is sorely in need of help
Almost everyone in Hollywood agrees that the Oscar ceremony is broken, including the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has -- belatedly, given years of stops and starts -- made fixing the telecast a six-alarm priority. The academy, which is under new management, had little choice after last year's debacle involving Smith.
Specific plans for this year's show are still secret. So far, the academy has said that there will be a host (Jimmy Kimmel, who has done the job twice before) and that all 23 categories will be presented live. (Eight were sidelined to commercial breaks last year, in a futile effort to save time.) Unlike in previous years, the academy hired producers for the telecast who are actually experienced in making live television.
Fewer stars have attended the Oscars over the past decade, in part because they don't want to sit through the marathon event. (Celebrities: They're just like us!) Academy officials have said they plan to make a renewed push for A-list attendees.

U.S. Accuses Google of Abusing Monopoly in Ad Technology

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department and a group of eight states sued Google on Tuesday, accusing it of illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology that powers online advertising, in the agency’s first antitrust lawsuit against a tech giant under President Joe Biden and an escalation in legal pressure on one of the world’s biggest internet companies.
The lawsuit said Google had “corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers and brokers to facilitate digital advertising.”
The lawsuit asked U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to force Google to sell much of its suite of ad technology products, which include software for buying and selling ads, a marketplace to complete the transactions and a service for showcasing the ads across the internet. The lawsuit also asked the court to stop the company from engaging in allegedly anti-competitive practices.
It is the fifth antitrust lawsuit filed by U.S. officials against Google since 2020 as lawmakers and regulators around the world try to rein in the power that big tech companies exert over information and commerce online. In Europe, Amazon, Google, Apple and others have faced antitrust investigations and charges, while regulators have passed new laws to limit social media’s harms and some practices such as data collection.
In the United States, Google has faced particular scrutiny. In 2020, a group of states led by Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit against it involving advertising technology, while the Justice Department and another group of states separately sued Google over claims that it abused its dominance over online search. In 2021, some states also sued over the company’s app store practices.
The new lawsuit “adds another important complication to Google’s efforts to deal with regulators worldwide,” said William Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. “There’s a chance one or more of these challenges is going to make its way through and hit the target.”
Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesperson, said the lawsuit “attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector.” It echoes the “unfounded” lawsuit led by Texas in 2020, he said, adding that the Justice Department’s latest suit makes a flawed argument that would slow innovation and harm publishers.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said monopolies “threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based.” He added, “We will aggressively protect consumers, safeguard competition and work to ensure economic fairness and opportunity for all.”
The Biden administration is trying to use uncommon legal theories to clip the wings of some of America’s largest businesses. The FTC recently asked a judge to block Meta from buying a virtual reality startup, a rare case that argues a deal could harm potential competition in a nascent market. The agency has also challenged Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, a notable action because the two companies are not primarily seen as direct competitors.

A New Way to Hand-Me-Down

In a San Antonio garage, two millennial mothers blast Avril Lavigne over speakers. They spend hours with the garage door open, soaking up the Texas air and sorting through small mountains of children’s clothes.
This is how Kara Livingston, 36, and Nicole Boynton, 35, describe a typical scene in their lives as the founders of Hand Me Up, a small business aimed at helping parents shop more responsibly to cut down on children’s clothing waste. Their online shop sells bags of secondhand clothing for babies and children up to age 6. The two women, longtime best friends who had been blogging and podcasting together, started the business in 2021.
Many parents, they knew, had scarce free time, tight budgets and growing children. It was tempting for parents to throw away outgrown clothes and shop fast fashion.
“Millennial moms, they’re the Amazon mom,” Livingston said. “The swipe-up-and-buy-type mom.”
Livingston and Boynton already had an interest in streamlining life for fellow parents — their blog Simply Whole Moms featured recipes for quick weeknight meals — and Boynton had an interest in ethical shopping, spurred by watching “The True Cost,” a 2015 documentary examining the impact of fast fashion.
Though the business is still small (the founders are the only employees), it is an effort to tackle the waste produced by children’s clothing, which is part of a bigger issue. The United States generated about 13 million tons of clothing and footwear waste in 2018, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Of that, the EPA estimates that only about 13% is recycled, while the remainder ends up incinerated or in landfills.
There is little data available about how much children’s clothing is discarded, said Amanda Forster, a materials research engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and an author of a 2022 report that looked at how to extend the life of textiles. The report said that a circular approach focused on reuse and repair is key, and Forster said that the principle applies to childrenswear as well.
“You want to try and keep things circulating back through the economy in their original form as much as possible,” Forster said.
The Hand Me Up platform is designed to be simple and inexpensive. Customers select their children’s sizes and needs, and for $40 plus shipping, the company sends a bag of secondhand clothing that includes three tops, three bottoms and one bonus item.
Most of the platform’s offerings are traditionally gendered clothes, but parents can use the company’s style quiz to request items free of certain colors or gendered phrases. The shop also offers a yearly subscription, in which customers receive a package each quarter. Shoppers who send in gently worn clothes receive a discount on their next order.
“We very intentionally make sure they don’t end up in the trash,” Boynton said. When they receive clothes that they can’t sell, they send them to a recycler.
More childrenswear brands have embraced responsible fashion in recent years, said Sandra Capponi, one of the founders of Good on You, a website and app that rates fashion brands for their impact on people, animals and the planet.
“Kidswear raises quite a unique, yet alarming, design challenge because that status quo of the linear take-make-waste model is amplified. As kids grow out of their clothes, parents ultimately, in many cases, dispose of them,” Capponi said. “So the kids’ clothes life cycle is much shorter compared to adult garments.”
Some major brands have their own reuse or resale initiatives, like Patagonia’s Worn Wear, and North Face’s Clothes the Loop. In 2021, Carter’s teamed with TerraCycle to start a program that allows parents to send unwearable clothes to be recycled into raw materials.
A company called the Swoondle Society offers a $20 per month membership to trade gently worn children’s clothes. Resale platforms such as Depop, Poshmark, ThredUp and Mercari also carry children’s clothes. Rental sites including Rent-a-Romper and the Little Loop are geared toward babies and small children.
“In 2022, kids’ shoes were among the top-selling categories, which makes sense knowing how quickly children grow,” said Tiffany Olson, a trend specialist at Mercari.
Many parents sell and shop at roving consignment sales such as Just Between Friends and Rhea Lana, as well as Kid to Kid and Once Upon a Child, both nationwide chains of secondhand children’s stores.
Founded in 1985, Once Upon a Child has more than 400 stores in the United States and Canada. The stores buy children’s toys, furniture and equipment, but Renae Gaudette, the chief operating officer of Winmark Corp., which owns Once Upon a Child, said about 75% of the inventory is apparel and footwear.
“The biggest threat we have as a brand is the garbage can,” she said. “It’s too easy for anyone to take their clothing and throw it in a garbage can.”
There are smaller, independent shops in the children’s resale world as well. In 2019, Carly Boonparn and Ambra Markos opened Parachute Brooklyn, a secondhand children’s clothing store in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. “None of my family is in New York. So when I had a child, I didn’t really know a lot of people with kids at that time,” Boonparn said. “I didn’t really have a lot of hand-me-downs.”
The store is now popular with mom groups, she said, who will sometimes meet and shop together, but paying rent for a storefront in New York City is a challenge. Competing with the myriad online secondhand resources is “tricky,” Boonparn said. “But I think it’s cool to have a space where customers can come in and see the items, and feel them, and try them on.”
Parents say that although there are more resale shopping options online, the shopping experience is not always straightforward. Addie Fisher, a 34-year-old digital content creator in Dallas and a mother of two, said she tries to primarily shop secondhand for her children, but on websites such as Poshmark, it can take time to sort through search results and the fees can add up.
“You see that the thing is $7 but then it’s $20 by the time you’ve checked out,” she said.
Other parents had similar experiences.
Whitney Kammer, 34, lives in San Antonio and is a stay-at-home mother with a 3-year-old daughter. She learned about Hand Me Up while in line for a Rhea Lana consignment sale, which she said she attends “religiously.”
“This sale only comes up twice a year, so if your kid goes through a growth spurt or something, you’re just out of luck,” Kammer said.
“At that point, you’re back to digging through racks at Goodwill or trying to shop secondhand online via Instagram or Etsy, and it’s a lot, a lot of work. Just the sheer amount of work and time it takes to do the responsible thing with purchasing children’s clothes especially is a huge commitment.”
Kammer signed up for a quarterly subscription to Hand Me Up, which she said has saved her time, effort and money. She also has a “friend trust of hand-me-downs,” in which she and her friends pass on children’s clothing.
For her, the decision to shop at secondhand sources is part of teaching her daughter more sustainable practices, even at a young age.
She said, “I want to pass on to my daughter that clothing is not disposable.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Layoffs in Tech Reveal a Divide Of Generations: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The industry's recent job cuts have been an awakening for a generation of workers who have never experienced a cyclical crash.
When Lyft laid off 13 percent of its workers in November, Kelly Chang was shocked to find herself among the 700 people who lost their jobs at the San Francisco company.
"It seemed like tech companies had so much opportunity," said Ms. Chang, 26. "If you got a job, you made it. It was a sustainable path."
Brian Pulliam, on the other hand, brushed off the news that the crypto exchange Coinbase was eliminating his job. Ever since the 48-year-old engineer was laid off from his first job at the video game company Atari in 2003, he said, he has asked himself once a year: "If I were laid off, what would I do?"
The contrast between Ms. Chang's and Mr. Pulliam's reactions to their professional letdowns speaks to a generational divide that is becoming more clear as the tech industry, which expanded rapidly through the pandemic, swings toward mass layoffs.
Microsoft said this week that it planned to cut 10,000 jobs, or roughly 5 percent of its work force. And on Friday morning, Google's parent company, Alphabet, said it planned to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its total. Their cuts followed big layoffs at other tech companies like Meta, Amazon and Salesforce.
Millennials and Generation Z, born between 1981 and 2012, started tech careers during a decade-long expansion when jobs multiplied as fast as iPhone sales. The companies they joined were conquering the world and defying economic rules. And when they went to work at outfits that offered bus rides to the office and amenities like free food and laundry, they weren't just taking on a new job -- they were taking on a lifestyle. Few of them had experienced widespread layoffs.
Baby boomers and members of Generation X, born between 1946 and 1980, on the other hand, lived through the biggest contraction the industry has ever seen. The dot-com crash of the early 2000s eliminated more than one million jobs, emptying Silicon Valley's Highway 101 of commuters as many companies folded overnight.
"It was a blood bath, and it went on for years," said Jason DeMorrow, a software engineer who was laid off twice in 18 months and was out of work for more than six months. "As concerning as the current downturn is, and as much as I empathize with the people impacted, there's no comparison."
Tech's generational divide is representative of a broader phenomenon. The year someone is born has a big influence on views about work and money. Early personal experiences strongly determine a person's appetite for financial risk, according to a 2011 study by the economists Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the University of Chicago.
The study, which analyzed the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances from 1960 to 2007, found that people who came of age in the 1970s, when the stock market stagnated, were reluctant to invest in the early 1980s, when it roared. That trend reversed in the 1990s.
"Once you experience your first crash, things change," Professor Nagel said. "You realize bad stuff happens and maybe you should be a bit more cautious."
For Gen X, the dot-com collapse hit early in careers. From 2001 to 2005, the tech sector shed a quarter of its workers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.
The layoffs that swept the industry were worse than the recession of the early 1990s, when total jobs in the tech sector fell by 5 percent, and the global financial crisis in 2008, when the work force contracted by 6 percent.
In 2011, the tech sector began a hiring boom that would last a decade. It added an average of more than 100,000 jobs annually, and by 2021, it had recouped all the jobs it lost when the dot-com bubble burst.
The job figures account for software, hardware, tech services and telecommunications companies, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Salesforce. But they may exclude some tech-related companies, such as Airbnb, Lyft and Uber, because of ambiguity in government labor market reporting that classifies some businesses as consumer services, said Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.
The biggest job increases in tech came after the pandemic started, as companies rushed to fulfill surging demand. In 2022, the sector added nearly 260,000 jobs, according to CompTIA, the most it had added in a single year since 2000.
Tech's job increases continued last year even as big layoffs started, though it is unclear if that trend has stretched into this year. New job opportunities were a factor as nearly 80 percent of laid-off tech workers said they had found a new job within three months, according to a survey by ZipRecruiter.
"We're seeing the hiring mania of the pandemic being corrected for -- not the popping of a bubble," said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of the career transition firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Last fall, David Hayden, a program manager with a doctorate in physics, learned from his manager that he would be let go from nLight, a semiconductor company. Worried about how he would pay his eldest daughter's college tuition, he immediately reached out to recruiters to line up interviews. In December, a month after being let go, he started a position at Lattice Semiconductor.
In each interview, Mr. Hayden, 56, volunteered that he had been laid off, he said. His experience during the dot-com crash, when he avoided layoffs even as talented colleagues were let go, taught him that cuts aren't always rational.
"The shame of being laid off is gone," Mr. Hayden said. "Companies know that a lot of good people are being let go right now."
For Mr. Pulliam, losing his job at Coinbase was an opportunity. He funneled his severance money into his own business, Refactor Coaching, a career coaching service for software engineers.
"This is a gift," Mr. Pulliam said. "I don't think that story is told. It's always doom and gloom."
But for tech workers experiencing their first economic downturn, the cuts have been eye opening. Ms. Chang studied product design in college with an eye toward joining a tech industry that seemed recession proof. Being laid off from Lyft shook that faith.
Erin Sumner, a software recruiter at Facebook's parent company, Meta, used to brag to potential hires that the company had been the fastest ever to be valued at $ 1 trillion. She said she would promote the company's strengths, even last year as its stock price tumbled and its core business, digital advertising, struggled.
When rumors of layoffs began to circulate last year, she assured colleagues that their jobs were safe, pointing to the more than $ 40 billion in cash the company had in the bank. But in November, she was among 11,000 workers laid off.
"It was gut-wrenching," Ms. Sumner, 32, said. She has found a new job as the head recruiter for DeleteMe, a start-up that aims to remove a customer's information from search results. But she said she cringed each time she read about more tech layoffs.
"I fear it's going to get worse before it gets better," Ms. Sumner said. "There's no guarantee. I got laid off by the most secure company in the world."
A similar reversal of fortune has challenged businesses selling software services. Shares of Salesforce, an industry leader, fell nearly 50 percent last year as its sales growth slowed. The company had splurged during the pandemic, spending $ 28 billion to buy Slack Technologies. It swelled to 80,000 employees from 49,000 in two years.
During an all-hands meeting last week to discuss the company's decision to lay off 10 percent of its workers, Marc Benioff, the chief executive, tried to sympathize with his unhappy staff by putting the cuts in context.
"I've been through a lot of difficult times in this company. Every loss reawakens another loss for me," he said, according to a recording of the call heard by The New York Times. "Obviously, we're talking about a layoff. I think about employees who have died. I think about people we've lost that we never wanted to lose."
Asked what advice he had for employees who were anxious about the state of the company and further layoffs, Mr. Benioff suggested "gratitude."
Austin Bedford learned that he was one of about 8,000 people being let go from Salesforce when he tried to log on to his computer and had no access to Slack, the tool that he worked on as a conversation designer. A native of East Palo Alto, Calif., he studied computer design because he hoped to join one of profitable companies in his backyard. The job he landed at the company in 2021 fulfilled a dream. He never imagined he would lose it so soon.
"I was shocked," said Mr. Bedford, 41.
Though disappointed that he was laid off, he said he was trying to view being out of work as a "blessing in disguise" and intended to be selective about his next job.
"There's something bright around the corner," Mr. Bedford said. "I just need to have faith."

In Love With a Love Story in India, for 27 Years: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Well past the film's intermission, the crowd keeps trickling in. Some pay at the ticketing window with a couple of taps on their phone; others dump fistfuls of coins. They are students and office clerks, prostitutes from the waning red-light district nearby, day laborers still chasing dreams in India's "maximum city," and the homeless with dreams long deferred.
India's film industry puts about 1,500 stories on the screen annually. But the audience that files every morning into the Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai is here for a movie that premiered 27 years ago -- and has resonated so intensely that this once-grand 1,100-seat theater has played it every day since, save for a pandemic hiatus.
The film, "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" -- which translates as "The Big-Hearted Will Take the Bride" and is known as "D.D.L.J." -- is a boy-meets-girl story set against the backdrop of a moment of immense change and unbridled possibility in India.
The Indian economy had just opened up, bringing new opportunities, new technologies and new exposure to a rising middle class. But it also brought new strains, as the choices afforded by economic opportunity -- to decide your own love and your own life -- ran up against the protective traditions of old.
In many ways, the India of today looks like the India reflected in the movie. The economy is still on the rise, and it is now about 10 times the size it was in the mid-1990s. A technological revolution, this one digital, has opened new worlds. Women are seeking more freedom in a male-dominated society. And the forces of modernity and conservatism remain in tension as an ascendant political right wing appoints itself the enforcer of conventional values.
The sense of unlimited possibility, however, has receded. As the early rewards of liberalization peaked and economic inequities deepened, aspirations of mobility have diminished. For those left behind, the world of "D.D.L.J." -- its story and stars, its music and dialogue -- is an escape. For those still striving, it is an inspiration. And for those who have made it, it is a time capsule, the starting point of India's transformation.
"It grew and grew and grew and went on to, you know, become an heirloom," said the actress Kajol, 48, who played the female lead, Simran, in the film. "I have had so many people who told me that, you know, we have made our children sit down and watch 'D.D.L.J.,' we have made our grandchildren sit down and watch -- and I was like, there are grandchildren now?"
She burst out laughing. "Children I am fine with. But grandchildren?"
When the pandemic closed theaters for a year, many speculated that "D.D.L.J.'s" record run would end. But the film is back on for its 11:30 a.m. slot at Maratha Mandir, often drawing crowds larger than those at afternoon screenings of the latest releases.
Some of those who show up have watched it here so many times that they have lost count -- 50, 100, hundreds.
A taxi driver who was in the line outside the theater one morning this fall had seen it six times, a welder about a dozen. A gray-bearded merchant of secondhand goods claimed about 50 viewings, the same for a 33-year-old delivery worker.
Then there were the regular regulars, those who trek here nearly every day. Madhu Sudan Varma, a 68-year-old homeless man who has a part-time job feeding neighborhood cats, comes about 20 mornings a month.
The woman with her head wrapped in a plastic bag?
"I come every day," she said. "I like it every day."
No one knows her real name -- it may be Jaspim, but even she is unsure. It doesn't matter, because everyone calls her by the name she prefers: Simran, just like the star on the screen.
Lying at night in the room she keeps as a prostitute in Kamathipura, Mumbai's red-light district, she sometimes dreams of the film's scenes, she says. In the morning, she makes sure she doesn't miss the show -- not even on this day when the henna she used to dye her graying hair hadn't yet dried. She would rather come wearing a plastic bag than not make it.
"I don't see any other films, just this one," she said. "I feel great when I come here. I get lost in the songs and dance."
'Live Your Life'
"D.D.L.J." is a love story. But it is also about compromise.
Kajol's character, Simran Singh, is brought up in London, though her father uses the income from the family's corner store to raise his children in the traditions of India.
On a European trip with friends, Simran meets Raj Malhotra, played by Shah Rukh Khan, a wealthy young man raised by a single father. The rest of the film's three hours are spent on the couple's efforts to persuade Simran's conservative father to let go of the arranged marriage he had planned for his daughter and bless their union.
"Go, Simran, go," the father declares at the end, after the film barrels through tears, bloody fistfights and many songs of longing. "Live your life."
Kajol said that the movie's middle path had broken new ground. Before "D.D.L.J.," she said, "we only had films that talked about either this way or that -- either we had films that celebrated marriages and everybody was involved from uncles to aunties, or it was 'us against the world, we will fight it out, we will live together, die together.' I think 'D.D.L.J.' came up with a very simple thought -- to say that maybe we can walk a line."
When the movie was released in 1995, Kajol and Mr. Khan were both relative newcomers. Kajol went on to become one of the most successful actresses in Hindi cinema. Mr. Khan, 57, found even greater fame, becoming one of India's most recognizable faces.
Both actors benefited from an Indian entertainment industry that was itself in transition, as money flooded in with the country's economic liberalization.
Now, the country has over 200 million households with televisions, up from 50 million then. Many more people can afford cinema tickets. And India, which recently became the world's fifth-largest economy, is expected to have one billion smartphone users by 2026.
Film stars have become permanent fixtures on billboards and on television commercials. India is a huge market -- it is projected to soon pass China as the world's most populous country -- and a star's simple post of sponsored content on platforms like Instagram can be lucrative. Actors who would once perform in different films in the same change of clothes now find themselves with unfathomable wealth.
Every day, fans throng outside Mr. Khan's seaside home in Mumbai, the heart of India's film industry, hoping for a sighting. Buses passing the road in front of his house slow down so passengers can take selfies.
On his birthday, thousands gather, waiting and chanting for Mr. Khan -- and he does not disappoint. He climbs up a caged platform, throwing kisses at the fans, before breaking into what has become his signature move: a leaned-back spread of the arms.
Bollywood has long favored those with legacy and family ties. Mr. Khan resonates as an outsider, a child of middle-class struggle in Delhi who lost both of his parents when he was young.
The towering residence he now occupies with his family "is a middle-class monument to a man who didn't own property," said the Indian economist Shrayana Bhattacharya. "He became this prism and this concept. He represents this idea of mobility."
Ms. Bhattacharya wrote a book, "Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh," about how Mr. Khan symbolizes the possibilities that only India's liberalized economy could produce, and what he has meant to young working women as he has challenged perceptions of masculinity in Indian cinema.
Taking advantage of new channels of information, he has built an image of an empathetic partner who listens, helps with household chores and shares the spotlight with female co-stars.
The power of this image, he said in one interview, has become such that he has become "an employee of the myth of Shah Rukh Khan." It is so potent that young women, Ms. Bhattacharya said, "want to be him" rather than want to "marry him," the emotion usually associated with older matinee idols.
To some women, Mr. Khan -- or at least his persona -- is a reminder of the ways Indian men have not changed. Surbhi Bhatia, a data and development researcher in Mumbai, said she often binge-watched his talks as an antidote to the restrictive male energy around her. If she is feeling low or uncertain, she strolls down to linger outside his seaside residence.
"You know when he spreads those arms," she said about Mr. Khan's signature move, "there is space to just go in."
In many ways, women have yet to achieve the economic promise of the new India. Only about a quarter of women participate in the work force, less than half the rate of all other major economies.
For women who have found economic opportunity, society has been slow to accept their independence. Having their own incomes -- or even just a smartphone -- has translated into some new freedom. But when a husband comes into the picture, Ms. Bhatia said, it brings another layer of permission and the forfeiture of leisure hours to household chores.
"The phone has done so much to give access, but not solved the larger problem," she said. "It's making us more lonely."
India is still trying to decide where to set the line that "D.D.L.J." suggested it walk between conservatism and modernity. Added to the tension is a Hindu-first fervor under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with Muslims in particular becoming a target. Mr. Khan, despite his crosscutting appeal, has not been spared.
This month, right-wing groups vandalized cinemas promoting Mr. Khan's latest film after a trailer showed its female star, Deepika Padukone, wearing a saffron bikini. The groups called the choice of saffron an offense to Hinduism, which is closely associated with the color.
Mr. Khan is a product of a secular India -- a Muslim who attended a Christian school and married a Hindu. Faced with attacks like these, he has largely stopped commenting on the country's political direction.
"I am a Muslim, my wife is a Hindu and my kids are Hindustan," Mr. Khan said on a television show in 2020, using another word for India. "When they went to school, they had to write their religion. My daughter came to me once and asked, 'What is our religion?' I simply wrote in her form that we are Indian."
'Love Doesn't End'
At the Maratha Mandir cinema, the logic of keeping one film running for nearly three decades is simple economics: New films could be hit or miss, but the crowd for "D.D.L.J." is steady.
"This picture is evergreen," said Manoj Desai, the cinema's 72-year-old executive director, "because it tells the story of true love. Because love doesn't end."
The theater's position near two transportation hubs ensures constant traffic. And it helps that the tickets are cheap: 30 rupees for downstairs seats and 40 for those in the balcony, or about 40 to 50 cents, a quarter of the price for admission to new releases.
"Three hours in air-conditioning, 40 rupees. Who will refuse that?" Mr. Desai said.
The interview with Mr. Desai was interrupted by frequent phone calls, including one from his wife. "Home minister," he said as he picked up her call.
He and his wife, who are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, went through a caste-based love struggle of their own, though with a different ending from the one in "D.D.L.J."
When her wealthy Jain parents refused Mr. Desai, a Gujarati Brahmin, they eloped and made their marriage official in a faraway temple. Her family kept looking for them for two years, trying to register her as a minor to charge Mr. Desai with kidnapping.
"Love has changed in the sense that breakups are easy," Mr. Desai lamented.
As he spoke, reporters called to inquire about a recent storm Mr. Desai had kicked up. In a scathing video interview, he had called a rising star "arrogant" for talking about taking his films directly to streaming services. The star was sent by his father on a private jet to Mr. Desai's office to touch his feet and apologize.
With Hindi cinema struggling to regain momentum after its pandemic lull, many producers and stars have opted to take their films directly to streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon.
To purists like Mr. Desai, the growing trend is blasphemy. "There is the money, but sirrrrr," he said, stretching and rolling his "r." "What about theater? What about the big screen?"
For the entire time that "D.D.L.J." has been showing on Mr. Desai's big screen, Jagjivan Maru has been the projectionist. He will soon retire after 50 years.
When he sets up the day's show, staff downstairs change into their uniforms, prepare the popcorn and samosas in the dimly lit corner concession stand and mop the marble floor between the rows of worn-out seats.
"For 10 years, the hall would be full -- there would queues for tickets," he said about the film's release in 1995. "After 10 years, it cooled off a bit -- but the passion hasn't died."
As customers line up to enter the theater, the guards frisking them and checking their bags repeat one reminder: "Don't put your feet on the seats." They know it's futile, because many come precisely for that -- to escape the city's heat, to put up their feet.
Mr. Varma, the 68-year-old homeless man, arrives at the ticket counter with his two bags of belongings, containing a blanket, some changes of clothes and his water bottle.
He sleeps in a parked auto rickshaw near a Buddha statue. Waking before dawn, he feeds about 50 neighborhood cats, for which an NGO pays him 100 rupees -- roughly $ 1.30 -- a day.
He worked in the family's furniture upholstery business before a dispute forced him to the streets. He has lost everyone dear in his life, from his siblings to his parents.
But one person resurfaced about 15 years ago: an unrequited love that had left him a bachelor. Caste differences made their union impossible, just as they prevent many love stories even today. The woman got married in 1984 and went on to have children who are now married.
The rekindling is one of friendship. They speak by phone once a month; he asks about her life, her children, and she asks if he is eating well.
"There were others who would call in the past," Mr. Varma said. "There is no one else now."
Mr. Varma takes his seat on the ground floor of the cinema hall. In the row in front of him is Simran, the prostitute.
When the movie's wildly popular songs come on, Simran shimmies in her seat, singing along and getting up to dance in the aisle. She mimics the dialogue. And when the Simran on the screen waves goodbye to Raj, the Simran in the theater also waves her hand in goodbye.
Every time the light from the screen reflects on Mr. Varma's face, he is lounged in his seat, his soft eyes glued to the film.
"I find peace here," Mr. Varma said. "I get a little calm."

Instead of New Homes, Depot of Idling Trucks Occupies Harlem Site: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A developer wanted to build residential towers, and a city councilwoman feared they would accelerate gentrification. Their fight reflects the challenge of building housing in New York.
The lot on West 145th Street in Manhattan was envisioned as a $ 700 million high-rise complex, with a civil rights museum and hundreds of below-market-rate apartments.
But after a local councilwoman protested, arguing that the project would bring more gentrification, the developer, Bruce Teitelbaum, gave an ultimatum: Unless his proposal was reconsidered, he would build a loud and unsightly truck depot.
On Wednesday, the trucks began to roll in.
"This is not the result we planned or hoped for on 145th Street," said Mr. Teitelbaum, once an aide to former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "But without someone who is willing to find common ground and compromise, we have no other viable alternative or choices."
The councilwoman, Kristin Richardson Jordan, who faces re-election this year, has said she made the right decision. She has argued that the so-called affordable units would still have been too expensive for working-class residents.
She said she would have agreed to the project had Mr. Teitelbaum agreed to include more homes that were affordable to people with lower incomes -- making a fifth of the apartments available to families of four earning $ 40,020 per year, for example, and reserving half of the apartments for families of four earning up to about $ 80,040.
"Let's be clear, that is already an extreme compromise and is still quite awful and would be a total financial windfall for this developer making him and his investors plenty of profit," she said. "And he should have taken it."
At a time when New York City faces a housing shortage, the tug of war over the Harlem project appears to be a case study in how the powerful whims of developers and the morass of local politics can make it difficult to build new homes.
It also provides a unique look into the high-stakes nature of housing in New York City. By choosing to park trucks on the lot, Mr. Teitelbaum has raised the cost to the community of rejecting his vision, raising the question of whether other developers might follow suit and use publicity-driven tactics to influence local politics.
At the same time, the drama of the Harlem case, and perhaps the threat that developers might try similar tactics elsewhere, has helped prompt a new spirit of cooperation among real estate executives and elected officials to find ways to make deals. Left-leaning City Council members recently backed two new affordable housing projects in Queens after negotiating with developers for more benefits for the community.
The 51-seat City Council has an unspoken tradition, known as member deference, that allows a council member to effectively veto land-use proposals in their district -- a process that gave Ms. Jordan a decisive voice in the Harlem project. Her opposition signaled it would face steep hurdles. It never came to a vote.
The yearslong fight over the Harlem housing project, known as One45, has been acrimonious, culminating in the arrival of the trucks on Wednesday at the new "Park Your Fleet" facility. Mr. Teitelbaum stood nearby, theatrically waving toward the more than 10 trucks idling around him.
"This is my dream," Mr. Teitelbaum said, his voice laced with sarcasm.
Iesha Sekou, a local activist with office space across the street from the depot, shouted at Mr. Teitelbaum from the sidewalk behind the chain-link fence, insisting that the depot would harm local children who suffered from asthma.
"He's doing this as revenge," said Ms. Sekou, founder of Street Corner Resources.
A man seated in the driver's seat in one of the trucks said his boss had told him to come to the depot and sit for a couple hours.
On Wednesday, Ms. Jordan asked state officials to shut down the depot over environmental concerns.
Mr. Teitelbaum said he was not being vindictive and that he could not let the lot sit empty. He said he was considering building a smaller luxury apartment building, a self-storage facility or parking on the block, which would not require City Council approval. He also said that the original proposal needed to contain some market-rate units to make it profitable.
"What is the point in restarting a totally unpredictable process that is doomed from the get-go?" Mr. Teitelbaum said.
The developer's most recent proposal, in May, which would have been contingent on a city subsidy, called for about 10 percent of the 915 apartments to be affordable to seniors and people at risk of homelessness, including those with a family of four who earn up to $ 40,020 per year. Some 13 percent of the apartments considered "affordable" would have targeted families earning closer to $ 160,000.
Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, has supported Mr. Teitelbaum's proposal, and the mayor's office said on Wednesday that he wanted to see housing on the site, not a truck depot. Charles Kretchmer Lutvak, a spokesman for the mayor, said that the Adams administration would "continue working with all of our partners on a comprehensive effort to bring much-needed affordable housing to Harlem and every neighborhood in New York City."
Don Curtis, president of the United Black Caucus, a civil rights group that organized people living in the neighborhood to fight the development, said he thought Mr. Teitelbaum was "bluffing" because he wanted to soften any potential opposition to a future development on the site.
Mr. Curtis said he would have supported a project that provided jobs to people in the neighborhood and lower-cost homes.
"It would have been the tallest structure in all of Harlem," he said. "It wouldn't have benefited the community."
Ms. Jordan, whose Twitter account had disappeared on Wednesday, identifies as a Black socialist, though groups like the Democratic Socialists of America and the left-wing Working Families Party did not endorse her in the 2021 primary, which she won by around 100 votes.
Earlier this month, she held a "Harlem Not For Sale" rally to oppose the truck depot. She said the community should not have to choose between a "high-rise luxury apartment complex that will displace our people in the last Black community in Manhattan and a truck stop that will add to the already dire levels of asthma in our community."
Before the pandemic, major proposals like a rezoning of Industry City in Brooklyn and a proposed new headquarters for Amazon in Queens were halted over concerns that they would not benefit the neighborhoods surrounding them. But with growing concerns over affordability in the city, elected officials have been more eager to work with developers.
The City Council speaker, Adrienne E. Adams, has signaled that she is open to ending member deference, saying that she values community input, but not "irrational opposition that rejects desperately needed housing." Ms. Adams helped negotiate the recent approval of a $ 2 billion development known as Innovation Queens that includes five towers and will add more than 3,000 homes in Astoria.
Mandela Jones, a spokesman for Ms. Adams, said on Wednesday that it was "unfortunate" that the Harlem housing proposal "fell short of the community investment, partnership and trust necessary to advance with support."
"We need to develop more housing at deeper affordability in every corner of the city to address this housing crisis, and the Council continues to consider all projects that seek to accomplish this goal for communities in good faith," he said.
The Manhattan borough president, Mark Levine, said this week that the city should make another attempt at rezoning the Harlem site to build affordable housing. He said that the earlier proposal was "not perfect" but it had met the goal of offering half affordable units.
"I'm optimistic that this is doable," he said. "It's going to take work and it's going to take compromise."
Anita Laremont, a former chair of the City Planning Commission and executive director of the city planning department under Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that even if the neighborhood and the city prefer housing, land use rules may give Mr. Teitelbaum the right to go forward with the truck depot. She said that "letting what somebody's conception of perfect is be the enemy of the good can result in consequences that are worse for the community."
But, she added, "I'm not sure if one is looking to build relationships with the community, that the sort of histrionics of this approach is the best way to do it."

The Meltdown Wasn't BAD For Crypto. It Was GOOD.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Despite trillions of dollars of losses, a batch of bankruptcies and one very high profile arrest, blockchain's devotees remain devoted.
On the wall in Ruar Street Food, a burger joint in the Sant Antoni neighborhood of Barcelona, there is a framed drawing of a male hand holding up a middle finger, high and proud, The image captures the defiant mood at a gathering of a couple dozen men and women in their 20s and 30s, all employed in various corners of the cryptocurrency world.
This industry has plenty of naysayers. But as far as everyone here tonight is concerned, those people can talk to the hand.
Which, given the onslaught of terrible news, goes beyond defiance and tip toes into the ZIP code of magical thinking. With spectacular losses ( $ 2 trillion in crypto assets, poof!), gruesome bankruptcies (Terra, Luna, Celsius) and fraud charges against the sector's highest-profile entrepreneur (Sam Bankman-Fried, of the now-kaput FTX exchange), few industries were more brutalized in 2022.
The carnage was not merely financial; the reputation and promise of crypto has been badly tarnished. Once touted as the future of money, a challenge to the world's central banks, not to mention a clever investment, crypto now carries the odor of disaster. The notion that it could serve as a hedge against inflation took a beating when Bitcoin fell more than 60 percent. Thousands of other tokens sank even lower or effectively vanished.
Despite this, attendees at the Ruar Street meet-up, organized by a crypto community called Web3 Family, are buoyant and ready for whatever 2023 has to offer. Beer flows, crypto-themed T-shirts are raffled off, fries with creamy cheddar and bacon are consumed. There are no hints of anxiety.
It's clear before the second round lands that the crypto faithful are keeping the faith.
The flock includes Maria Rebelo, a 27-year-old who works for a Canadian company called Ureeqa that helps artists monetize NFTs, a.k.a. nonfungible tokens. These are digital assets -- photos, music, sports memorabilia, whatever -- that are recorded and tracked by blockchain, the virtual ledger that enables all things crypto. She rhapsodized about how blockchain could lead to "a worldwide community, instead of one government per country."
"When we open up the decentralized world, we offer ways for humans to collaborate in ways they never have before," she said. "That's human development."
Interviews in Barcelona and with executives around the world suggest that a year's worth of fiascos has done little to diminish the enthusiasm of true believers. Many liken this moment to the dot-com crash of 2001, a calamity that wiped out even more wealth -- an estimated $ 5 trillion -- and ultimately yielded some blue-chip companies. ("Amazon was down 90 percent at one point" is a line uttered time and again.)
A variation of that sentiment was offered by Joe Hernandez, who handles fraud detection for a company called Gitcoin, a platform that promises on its website to "build and fund open web together." He was taking a smoke break on the sidewalk outside of Ruar, wearing a purple-and-white varsity jacket, its back emblazoned with the image of an astronaut playing an arcade game.
He is an American, who happened to be visiting Barcelona. Other digital nomads have settled here, drawn by the city's beauty and relative affordability and hailing from China, Argentina, Portugal, France, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Many say that crypto is shouldering the blame for the bad actors that it attracts. Swindlers are going to swindle.
"Every cycle, a bunch of fraudsters come along and a bunch of tokens go to zero," Mr. Hernandez said. "Galling is a pretty good word for it. Because it scares a lot of people away."
Some of the crypto faithful see an upside to the wipeout of 2022. To them it was like a four-keg frat party that the cops busted. Those still standing are proud to say that they weren't distracted by the revelry.
"Now more than ever we're encouraged that we are doing the right thing by just believing in the fundamentals of crypto," said Elion Chin, the co-creator of Nimiq, an open-source payment system that allows users to hold and spend crypto right from their web browsers. Like thousands of ventures, Nimiq has also issued a coin, which is down 92 percent from its high in 2021.
Yet none of its 27 "full-time contributors" have left.
"Money is very important, but that's not necessarily the full and only reward our contributors are getting here," Mr. Chin said on a phone call from Costa Rica. "They're working with people they enjoy working with, on something they believe can make a difference."
This is a common refrain. While crypto has been associated with quick riches, good luck finding people who will say they are sticking it out for a payday. Instead, there's a lot of earnest talk about the ways that blockchain will transform the world -- helping to solve climate change, streamlining supply chains, even reshaping work in a way that lets more people find jobs they enjoy. (Because the blockchain can handle all sorts of drudgery.)
There is also lot of talk about agitating to free incarcerated heroes of the cyber world. The crypto catechism has an anti-government, libertarian streak that quickly surfaces over cocktails. Among the giveaways tonight is a T-shirt reading "Free Alex Pertsev," who is in jail in the Netherlands, facing charges of money laundering. He is the developer of Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
In this crowd only banks are held in greater suspicion than governments. If you think of your bank as nothing more than a dull place to stash money, you have probably never spent much time with crypto evangelists. These institutions stand accused of profiteering, money laundering and keeping tabs on how people spend, which is just the kind of information the government is already collecting -- in order to track your carbon footprint.
That, at least, is the hunch of a young Italian at the Ruar meet-up, a guy in a smart blue sweater who could pass for a first-year management consultant. He did not want his name in this story, part of a broader ethos of remaining as invisible as possible. He described a future in which governments fine citizens for contributing to climate change, and said there's no better way to keep tabs on that than through what those citizens spend, something only banks know.
For years, there's been talk about the separation of church and state, he explained. Crypto will hasten the separation of money and state.
While crypto's supporters focus on wildly ambitious goals in an imagined future, critics point to debacles that happen all the time. Like the theft of $ 3 billion worth of crypto last year, as estimated by Chainanalysis. Then there is the discomfiting reality that crypto streamlines life for criminals -- human traffickers, drug dealers, ransomware extractors, mobsters and the government of North Korea, which employs hackers who steal crypto all day, every day.
"Terrible things happen in crypto pretty regularly and yet the crypto faithful are very good at separating them from their perceived ideal of crypto," said Molly White, who runs Web3 Is Going Just Great, a website that chronicles crypto's tribulations. "If something goes poorly, it's always some other factor, like poor implementation. Which makes it easy to hold on to your ideological position."
As Ms. White notes, crypto has been around since 2009 and has yet to produce a single product or service that ordinary people use in their daily lives. Just wait, counter the crypto faithful, who contend an epochal breakthrough is around the corner. It's like a cult leader who has predicted the end of the world on a certain day. When the apocalypse fails to materialize, core tenets are not abandoned. Instead, a new date is named.
That said, crypto's highly public battering has forced companies to re-evaluate their strategies. There was a time when businesses that weren't even in the tech sphere reached for crypto magic by adding "blockchain" to their name, which often goosed their stock price. Most famously, the Long Island Iced Tea Corporation became the Long Blockchain Corporation, and its stock rose nearly 300 percent in a day.
Now, the opposite is happening -- companies squarely in the crypto sphere are shedding the "b" word. In early January, a Bitcoin mining company, Riot Blockchain, became Riot Platforms. In October, Applied Blockchain became Applied Digital. ("We're broadening our scope," an executive said in an interview with the Street.) A lot of venture capital firms that once chased crypto projects now will not return calls.
Reinventions are underway. Ziliqa, which long pitched itself as a blockchain platform, is barreling into the world of online games. In October, it launched Web3War, a first-person shooter, and another eight or nine titles are in the works. Game-related commerce will be handled on the blockchain. But ideally, said Matt Ryan, the chief executive, gamers will not notice.
"They don't need to see the blockchain; they just need to know that it works," he said in a video interview from his home in London.
Calling this venture quixotic doesn't capture it. Gaming is a mature and crowded market, led by blue-chip corporations, like Sony and Microsoft, and dominated by titans like PUBG: Battlegrounds, which has been downloaded more than one billion times.
And Web3War? To date, about 5,500 people have signed up. Mr. Ryan is undaunted.
"I think if we get to 10,000, watch this space," he said. "It proves we've got a product that people want."
Mr. Ryan is a born optimist, he acknowledges, and that is true for most of the crypto faithful. This entails not just predicting a great future for blockchain, but ignoring its failures.
In November, the Australian Securities Exchange canceled plans for a blockchain-based system for clearing trades, incurring a $ 168 million charge. In November, the Danish shipping company Maersk unplugged its blockchain platform. In a statement, it said, "the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved."
These failures do not surprise Lee Reiners, policy director at the Duke Financial Economics Center. Blockchain is essentially a database software, he notes, and not a very popular one. It would never have achieved its devoted following, or attracted billions in venture capital funding, without its connection to crypto. And that, he says, is a tragedy no one has fully reckoned with.
"Imagine if all the money and talent flooding into crypto over the last ten years had gone into combating climate change or cancer research," Professor Reiners said. "It's a tremendous misuse of societal resources, and it's all because people wanted to make money fast. Despite what they're saying, what attracted most folks was the perceived opportunity to get rich quick."
The talent that Professor Reiners thinks has been misallocated begs to differ. The meet-up at Ruar ended late, with a small group discussing how the pandemic proved that governments could easily control their populations, and the ways that banks chipped in. One attendee mentioned that the account of a customer had been closed for refusing to wear a mask during a visit to a bank. If all goes as planned, that customer will someday have other options.
"From where I'm standing, there's an opportunity to tell the world that there's a paradigm-changing positive future that blockchain enables," said Mr. Hernandez of Gitcoin. "But that's not the story right now."

BARCELONA — On the wall in Ruar Street Food, a burger joint in the Sant Antoni neighborhood of Barcelona, there is a framed drawing of a male hand holding up a middle finger, high and proud. The image captures the defiant mood at a gathering of a couple of dozen men and women in their 20s and 30s, all employed in various corners of the cryptocurrency world.
This industry has plenty of naysayers. But as far as everyone here tonight is concerned, those people can talk to the hand.
Which, given the onslaught of terrible news, goes beyond defiance and tiptoes into the ZIP code of magical thinking. With spectacular losses ($2 trillion in crypto assets, poof!), gruesome bankruptcies (Terra, Luna, Celsius) and fraud charges against the sector’s highest-profile entrepreneur (Sam Bankman-Fried, of the now-kaput FTX exchange), few industries were more brutalized in 2022.
The carnage was not merely financial; the reputation and promise of crypto has been badly tarnished. Once touted as the future of money, a challenge to the world’s central banks, not to mention a clever investment, crypto now carries the odor of disaster. The notion that it could serve as a hedge against inflation took a beating when bitcoin fell more than 60%. Thousands of other tokens sank even lower or effectively vanished.
Despite this, attendees at the Ruar Street meet-up, organized by a crypto community called Web3 Family, are buoyant and ready for whatever 2023 has to offer. Beer flows, crypto-themed T-shirts are raffled off, fries with creamy cheddar and bacon are consumed. There are no hints of anxiety.
It’s clear before the second round lands that the crypto faithful are keeping the faith.
The flock includes Maria Rebelo, a 27-year-old who works for a Canadian company called Ureeqa that helps artists monetize NFTs, aka nonfungible tokens. These are digital assets — photos, music, sports memorabilia, whatever — that are recorded and tracked by blockchain, the virtual ledger that enables all things crypto. She rhapsodized about how blockchain could lead to “a worldwide community, instead of one government per country.”
“When we open up the decentralized world, we offer ways for humans to collaborate in ways they never have before,” she said. “That’s human development.”
Interviews in Barcelona and with executives around the world suggest that a year’s worth of fiascos has done little to diminish the enthusiasm of true believers. Many liken this moment to the dot-com crash of 2001, a calamity that wiped out even more wealth — an estimated $5 trillion — and ultimately yielded some blue-chip companies. (“Amazon was down 90% at one point” is a line uttered time and again.)
A variation of that sentiment was offered by Joe Hernandez, who handles fraud detection for a company called Gitcoin, a platform that promises on its website to “build and fund open web together.” He was taking a smoke break on the sidewalk outside of Ruar, wearing a purple-and-white varsity jacket, its back emblazoned with the image of an astronaut playing an arcade game.
He is an American, who happened to be visiting Barcelona. Other digital nomads have settled here, drawn by the city’s beauty and relative affordability and hailing from China, Argentina, Portugal, France, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Many say that crypto is shouldering the blame for the bad actors that it attracts. Swindlers are going to swindle.
“Every cycle, a bunch of fraudsters come along and a bunch of tokens go to zero,” Hernandez said. “Galling is a pretty good word for it. Because it scares a lot of people away.”
Some of the crypto faithful see an upside to the wipeout of 2022. To them it was like a four-keg frat party that the cops busted. Those still standing are proud to say that they weren’t distracted by the revelry.
“Now more than ever we’re encouraged that we are doing the right thing by just believing in the fundamentals of crypto,” said Elion Chin, co-creator of Nimiq, an open-source payment system that allows users to hold and spend crypto right from their web browsers. Like thousands of ventures, Nimiq has also issued a coin, which is down 92% from its high in 2021.
Yet none of its 27 “full-time contributors” have left.
“Money is very important, but that’s not necessarily the full and only reward our contributors are getting here,” Chin said on a phone call from Costa Rica. “They’re working with people they enjoy working with, on something they believe can make a difference.”
This is a common refrain. While crypto has been associated with quick riches, good luck finding people who will say they are sticking it out for a payday. Instead, there’s a lot of earnest talk about the ways that blockchain will transform the world — helping to solve climate change, streamlining supply chains, even reshaping work in a way that lets more people find jobs they enjoy. (Because the blockchain can handle all sorts of drudgery.)
There is also lot of talk about agitating to free incarcerated heroes of the cyber world. The crypto catechism has an anti-government, libertarian streak that quickly surfaces over cocktails. Among the giveaways tonight is a T-shirt reading “Free Alex Pertsev,” who is in jail in the Netherlands, facing charges of money laundering. He is the developer of Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
In this crowd only banks are held in greater suspicion than governments. If you think of your bank as nothing more than a dull place to stash money, you have probably never spent much time with crypto evangelists. These institutions stand accused of profiteering, money laundering and keeping tabs on how people spend, which is just the kind of information the government is collecting — in order to track your carbon footprint.
That, at least, is the hunch of a young Italian at the Ruar meet-up, a guy in a smart blue sweater who could pass for a first-year management consultant. He did not want his name in this story, part of a broader ethos of remaining as invisible as possible. He described a future in which governments fine citizens for contributing to climate change, and said there’s no better way to keep tabs on that than through what those citizens spend, something only banks know.
For years, there’s been talk about the separation of church and state, he explained. Crypto will hasten the separation of money and state.
While crypto’s supporters focus on wildly ambitious goals in an imagined future, critics point to debacles that happen all the time. Like the theft of $3 billion worth of crypto last year, as estimated by Chainanalysis. Then there is the discomfiting reality that crypto streamlines life for criminals — human traffickers, drug dealers, ransomware extractors, mobsters and the government of North Korea, which employs hackers who steal crypto all day, every day.
“Terrible things happen in crypto pretty regularly and yet the crypto faithful are very good at separating them from their perceived ideal of crypto,” said Molly White, who runs Web3 Is Going Just Great, a website that chronicles crypto’s tribulations. “If something goes poorly, it’s always some other factor, like poor implementation. Which makes it easy to hold on to your ideological position.”
As White notes, crypto has been around since 2009 and has yet to produce a single product or service that ordinary people use in their daily lives. Just wait, counter the crypto faithful, who contend an epochal breakthrough is around the corner. It’s like a cult leader who has predicted the end of the world on a certain day. When the apocalypse fails to materialize, core tenets are not abandoned. Instead, a new date is named.
That said, crypto’s highly public battering has forced companies to reevaluate their strategies. There was a time when businesses that weren’t even in the tech sphere reached for crypto magic by adding “blockchain” to their name, which often goosed their stock price. Most famously, the Long Island Iced Tea Corp. became the Long Blockchain Corp., and its stock rose nearly 300% in a day.
Now, the opposite is happening — companies squarely in the crypto sphere are shedding the “b” word. In early January, a bitcoin mining company, Riot Blockchain, became Riot Platforms. In October, Applied Blockchain became Applied Digital. (“We’re broadening our scope,” an executive said in an interview with the Street.) A lot of venture capital firms that once chased crypto projects now will not return calls.
Reinventions are underway. Ziliqa, which long pitched itself as a blockchain platform, is barreling into the world of online games. In October, it launched Web3War, a first-person shooter, and another eight or nine titles are in the works. Game-related commerce will be handled on the blockchain. But ideally, said Matt Ryan, the CEO, gamers will not notice.
“They don’t need to see the blockchain; they just need to know that it works,” he said in a video interview from his home in London.
Calling this venture quixotic doesn’t capture it. Gaming is a mature and crowded market, led by blue-chip corporations such as Sony and Microsoft and dominated by titans including PUBG: Battlegrounds, which has been downloaded more than 1 billion times.
And Web3War? To date, about 5,500 people have signed up. Ryan is undaunted.
“I think if we get to 10,000, watch this space,” he said. “It proves we’ve got a product that people want.”
Ryan is a born optimist, he acknowledges, and that is true for most of the crypto faithful. This entails not just predicting a great future for blockchain, but ignoring its failures.
In November, the Australian Securities Exchange canceled plans for a blockchain-based system for clearing trades, incurring a $168 million charge. In November, Danish shipping company Maersk unplugged its blockchain platform. In a statement, it said, “the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved.”
These failures do not surprise Lee Reiners, policy director at the Duke Financial Economics Center. Blockchain is essentially a database software, he notes, and not a very popular one.

And that, he says, is a tragedy no one has fully reckoned with.

Ruggero Deodato, 83, Director Of Grisly 'Cannibal Holocaust': [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He directed a variety of movies in a variety of genres. But it was a gruesome found-footage film that brought him both fame and infamy.
When you make the most infamous movie ever to come out of a genre sometimes called the cannibal vomitorium, you've achieved true cinematic notoriety.
That distinction belongs to the Italian director Ruggero Deodato, whose "Cannibal Holocaust" is said to have gotten him briefly accused of murder because of death scenes that seemed a little too real, as well as generating complaints for obscenity and animal cruelty.
The film, released in 1980 in Italy and later (sometimes after overcoming bans) in other countries, drew scalding comments from critics and some film scholars. In 1985 the "Phantom of the Movies" column in The Daily News of New York called it "the kind of brain-damaged, stomach-churning cinematic offal that gives junk movies a bad name."
And yet the movie also developed a cult following and is widely credited with influencing later films, especially "The Blair Witch Project" (1999), which, like "Cannibal Holocaust," used a found-footage conceit intended to leave viewers asking, "Was it real?"
Mr. Deodato died on Dec. 29 in Rome. He was 83.
Eugenio Ercolani, a filmmaker and film historian who had interviewed Mr. Deodato extensively, confirmed the death. He said Mr. Deodato had pneumonia and had been experiencing kidney and liver failure.
Mr. Deodato made a variety of movies in a career that began in the 1960s, as well as directing commercials and episodes of Italian television series. There was, for instance, "Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man" (1976), a crime thriller that Mr. Deodato said was one of his personal favorites. "Last Feelings" (1978), a romantic drama about a competitive swimmer who learns he has a terminal illness, drew comparisons (usually unfavorable) to "Love Story," the 1970 American blockbuster.
But his horror films of the late 1970s and '80s overshadowed everything else. He directed in a subgenre that, generally speaking, featured encounters between modern Westerners and jungle dwellers, with the Westerners not faring well. Before "Cannibal Holocaust," he worked the territory with "The Last Survivor" (1977, also released under assorted other titles), in which oil prospectors whose plane is damaged in a rough landing in the Philippines are greeted by cannibals.
"Director Ruggero Deodato's unselective barrage of torture and bloodletting includes termites eating human flesh, a python eating an iguana and a girl giving birth and tossing her infant to a hungry crocodile," Linda Gross wrote in a 1978 review in The Los Angeles Times.
"Promotion material claims 'The Last Survivor' was made among authentic tribes and that one crew member who disappeared during filmmaking is presumed to be a victim of cannibalistic rites," she added. "Pity the cannibals didn't eat the film instead."
And then came "Cannibal Holocaust." Filmed in Leticia, in the rain forest of southern Colombia near the country's borders with Peru and Brazil, it tells the story of an American professor who travels to the Amazon to investigate the disappearance of four journalists who had gone there to make a documentary on cannibal tribes. He finds their film, which recorded atrocities the journalists themselves committed as well as their brutal deaths.
Though Mr. Deodato used local villagers for much of the cast, he brought in some young actors to play the Westerners and, he said, had them sign agreements to not appear in anything else for a year, to keep up the illusion that parts of the movie were real.
That came back to haunt him. He said he was accused of actually murdering the actors -- of, essentially, making a snuff film -- and had to seek them out and produce them in public to get those charges dropped. Other charges, though, stuck, including ones stemming from the real deaths of several animals during the filming.
"To confiscate the film the authorities applied a public health law banning the importing of Spanish bullfighting in Italy, and on the basis of this law they seized the film," he told Starburst magazine years later. "I was fined millions of lira and given a four months suspended sentence."
Mr. Ercolani, who included an interview with Mr. Deodato in his book "Darkening the Italian Screen: Interviews With Genre and Exploitation Directors Who Debuted in the 1950s and 1960s" (2019) and produced the special features included in a recent rerelease of "Cannibal Holocaust," said that Mr. Deodato "in many ways composed, rather than directed, 'Cannibal Holocaust,' as if in a long improvisational jazz session."
"Ruggero Deodato was a director who put himself at the service of the market's needs," Mr. Ercolani said by email. "He wasn't an intellectual, but he was an acutely instinctive man and director. He loved the process of storytelling, may it be in films, TV series or commercials. He had a great sense of rhythm and could recognize a good story."
"This is not to say he wouldn't put any thought into what he did," he added, "but he was a man who gave priority to what he felt rather than what he thought. In many ways you could say he followed his gut right into film history with 'Cannibal Holocaust."'
Mr. Deodato was born on May 7, 1939, in Potenza, in southern Italy. His family moved to the Parioli neighborhood of Rome when he was a child, and he got a taste of acting.
"I participated in the early to mid-'50s in a handful of films," he said in his interview for Mr. Ercolani's book, "and I was even called by Federico Fellini to audition for a role -- I don't remember for which film -- but in the meantime I had gone through puberty and I had lost my boyish charm. I wore glasses, had bad skin, and was discarded immediately."
As a teenager he befriended Renzo Rossellini, son of the director Roberto Rossellini, which provided him with more connections in the film world. In the 1960s he worked with a number of Italian directors on a variety of movies, including Antonio Margheriti's horror and fantasy titles ("Horror Castle," "Anthar l'Invincibile") and Sergio Corbucci's westerns ("Django").
"I was lucky enough to have been exposed to many different directors," he said, "and each one of them has been essential to my growth. Margheriti taught me a lot about special effects, while from Sergio Corbucci I inherited a certain taste for violence and brutality."
Mr. Deodato was married to the actress Silvia Dionisio in the 1970s and since the 1990s had been in a relationship with the actress Valentina Lainati. He is also survived by a son, Saverio, and a daughter, Beatrice.
Mr. Deodato's movies after "Cannibal Holocaust" included "Cut and Run" (1985), which involved a cable news crew, drug smuggling and lots of corpses. "You can wait years for a movie as bad as 'Cut and Run,"' Bill Cosford wrote in a review in The Miami Herald. He also acted occasionally, in his own movies and those of others; his credits included an appearance in "Hostel: Part II" (2007) by the director Eli Roth, a fan of "Cannibal Holocaust."
Mr. Deodato was still racking up minor directing credits until a few years ago. Throughout his career, he was constantly asked about his most famous creation.
"He would at times embellish and build upon the numerous legends and myths that surround the complicated making of the film, often contradicting himself in the process," Mr. Ercolani said. "What is evident is that 'Cannibal Holocaust' ended up being a gilded cage for its director.
"I feel a large portion of Deodato's life has been passed battling his own creature, trying to reason with it, or maybe simply trying to fully understand it, and fending off perceptions the film generated about him over the years while embracing the fame it brought him. Deodato was a fun-loving, womanizing, outrageous, egocentric man, larger than life in so many ways, who found himself living for decades with this dark, fascinatingly twisted creature that he tried to educate and direct but that would not listen."

Israel Moves Right at 'Dizzying Speed': [briefing]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Israel's new right-wing government is moving quickly to transform the country.
Israel's government, the most right-wing in its history, is barely three weeks old and already leaving its mark, quickly pressing ahead with legislation that critics fear will erode Israeli democracy. Benjamin Netanyahu has returned as prime minister, this time leading a coalition of conservative, far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties.
I spoke with Isabel Kershner, a correspondent in The Times's Jerusalem bureau, about the right's push to transform Israel.
Ian: What is the new government trying to accomplish?
Isabel: The right-wing parties in the coalition are all extremely ideological, and Netanyahu has made a lot of concessions to them. The new minister of national security is an ultranationalist who has been convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism. He got more authority over the police. The new hard-right finance minister is claiming more authority over Jewish settlements and civilian affairs in the occupied West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers want more autonomy and more funding for religious students and schools.
The government is also moving to radically overhaul the judiciary. There's a perception on the right that the Supreme Court is overly activist and sides with liberals on issues like settlements. Now the coalition wants to give parliament more power to select judges and override Supreme Court rulings. Critics say the coalition's proposed changes would completely change the nature of Israel's liberal democracy, which is dynamic but also fragile. Israel doesn't have a formal constitution; it has basic laws that can be changed with 61 out of 120 votes in the parliament. Netanyahu's coalition has 64.
Netanyahu is on trial for corruption. Has that made him more reliant on the far right?
Israel's whole political morass -- the deadlock that's produced five elections in four years -- is basically because Netanyahu has been indicted on corruption charges but won't step aside. In the past, Netanyahu preferred to form governments with more centrist or even center-left parties. This time, the centrists refused to align with a prime minister on trial, so Netanyahu was at the mercy of far-right parties after the election. They were the only partners he could form a government with, and they knew that.
How has the country reacted?
What's taken many Israelis by surprise is the dizzying speed and determination with which the new government has moved ahead. That's really galvanized the opposition. Before the election, the liberal and centrist parties in parliament basically failed to cooperate with each other. Suddenly you're seeing them sitting together, planning the next demonstration and making radical statements of their own. Yair Lapid, the centrist opposition leader, said the judicial overhaul constituted "extreme regime change" and could eliminate Israeli democracy.
It reminds me of the mood in the U.S. after Donald Trump got elected.
There was a pro-L.G.B.T.Q. protest on the day the new government was sworn in, because Netanyahu's coalition includes some extremely anti-gay lawmakers. There have since been protests, including a big one last night, in Tel Aviv, a more secular, liberal city about an hour from Jerusalem.
Israel has seen big protests before. In recent years anti-Netanyahu demonstrators protested outside the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem. But that was a much more grass-roots, bottom-up movement. What we're seeing now is the leaders of the opposition parties calling on people to come out into the streets.
What does the new government mean for relations with the Palestinians?
The levels of confidence are below zero. One of the main concerns for the Palestinian Arabs who make up one-fifth of Israel's citizens is a surge in crime, murders and criminal gang warfare. The previous Israeli government, which for the first time included a small Islamic Arab party in the governing coalition, prioritized fighting crime in conjunction with Arab local authorities. Now the minister overseeing the police has a history of being an anti-Arab activist and provocateur. Meanwhile, the situation regarding the Palestinians in the occupied territories was already tense, and things have quickly become confrontational.
How has all this left Israelis feeling about the state of their politics?
Things here feel more polarized than ever, and there's a lot at stake. The country is split over what kind of democracy Israel should be and how it's going to relate to Palestinians. Even among the half of the country that did vote for a right-wing party, not all of them are happy. It's gone a bit further than some of them wanted. Some are throwing their hands up or switching off the news. Anecdotally, I'm hearing about more people applying for foreign passports. Among those who oppose the government, there's a kind of doomsday feel.
More about Isabel: She grew up in the United Kingdom, speaks Hebrew and studied Arabic at Oxford University. She spent a gap year in Israel, then another year in Egypt. An early obsession with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict led her to journalism.

Microsoft Bets Big on the Creator of ChatGPT in Race to Dominate A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When a chatbot called ChatGPT hit the internet late last year, executives at a number of Silicon Valley companies worried they were suddenly dealing with new artificial intelligence technology that could disrupt their businesses.
But at Microsoft, it was a cause for celebration. For several years, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, had been putting the pieces in place for this moment.
In 2019, Microsoft invested $ 1 billion in OpenAI, the tiny San Francisco company that designed ChatGPT. And in the years since, it has quietly invested another $ 2 billion, according to two people familiar with the investment who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.
The $ 3 billion paid for the huge amounts of computing power that OpenAI needed to build the chatbot. And it meant that Microsoft could rapidly build and deploy new products based on the technology.
Microsoft is now poised to challenge Big Tech competitors like Google, Amazon and Apple with a technological advantage the company has not possessed for more than two decades. Microsoft is in talks to invest another $ 10 billion in OpenAI as it seeks to push its technology even further, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The potential $ 10 billion deal -- which would mainly provide OpenAI with even larger amounts of computing power -- has not been finalized and the funding amount could change. But the talks are indicative of the tech giant's determination to be on the leading edge of what has become the hottest technology in the tech industry.
Mr. Nadella worked with A.I. technologies when he ran Microsoft's Bing search engine more than a decade ago, and for several years he has convened a biweekly internal meeting of A.I. leaders.
"The expectation from Satya is that we're pushing the envelope in A.I., and we're going to do that across our products," Eric Boyd, the executive responsible for Microsoft's A.I. platform team, said in an interview.
Microsoft's new talks with OpenAI were reported earlier by Semafor. Its additional $ 2 billion investment in the company was earlier reported by The Information and Fortune.
ChatGPT answers questions, writes poetry and riffs on almost any topic tossed its way. Based on earlier technologies called GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, it is the most conspicuous example of technology called generative artificial intelligence, the term for a system that can generate text, images, sounds and other media in response to short prompts.
"It has already been a home run partly because Satya was prescient enough to make the bet three years ago, and because all applications will be generative in the future," said Matt McIlwain, a managing partner at Seattle's Madrona Venture Group.
The new generative A.I. technologies could reinvent everything from online search engines like Google to digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. Microsoft sees these technologies as a way of expanding and improving its already wide range of products for businesses, computer programmers and consumers, while boosting revenues across its Azure cloud computing services.
"It is just fascinating to see how these generative models are capturing the imagination," Mr. Nadella told developers in India last week, adding, "I think it is a golden age."
OpenAI is working on an even more powerful system called GPT-4, which could be released as soon as this quarter, according to Mr. McIlwain and four other people with knowledge of the effort. Microsoft declined to comment on its future product plans.
Built using Microsoft's huge network for computer data centers, the new chatbot could be a system much like ChatGPT that solely generates text. Or it could juggle images as well as text. Some venture capitalists and Microsoft employees have already seen the service in action. But OpenAI has not yet determined whether the new system will be released with capabilities involving images.
OpenAI is led by Sam Altman, who became well known in Silicon Valley as the head the start-up builder Y Combinator. Mr. Altman, 37, and his co-founders created OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit. But he soon remade the venture as a for-profit company that could more aggressively pursue financing.
A year later, Microsoft invested $ 1 billion in the company and committed to building the supercomputer technologies OpenAI's enormous models would demand while becoming its "preferred partner for commercializing" its technologies. OpenAI later officially licensed its technologies to Microsoft, allowing the company to directly add them to Microsoft products and services.
With backing from Microsoft, OpenAI went on to build a milestone technology called GPT-3. Known as a "large language model," it could generate text on its own, including tweets, blog posts, news articles and even computer code.
Clunky to use, it was mostly a tool for businesses and engineers. But a year later, OpenAI began work on DALL-E, which allowed anyone to generate realistic images simply by describing what they want to see. Microsoft incorporated GPT-3, DALL-E and similar technologies into its own products.
GitHub, a popular online service for programmers owned by Microsoft, began offering a programming tool called Copilot. As programmers built smartphone apps and other software, Copilot suggested the next line of code as they typed, much the way autocomplete tools suggest the next word as you type texts or emails.
For many, it was a "jaw dropping moment" that showed what's possible, Mr. Boyd, of Microsoft, said.
Then, at the end of last year, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT. More than a million people tested the chatbot during its first few days online. It answered trivia questions, explained ideas and generated everything from school papers to pop song lyrics.
Microsoft last year began incorporating DALL-E image creations into its Bing search engine, and is working with OpenAI on a new version of the search engine that would include technology along the lines of ChatGPT, according to The Information.
Google, Meta and other companies have spent years building models similar to ChatGPT. The A.I. systems develop their skills by analyzing enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, computer programs and chat logs.
"Building these systems really requires a supercomputer -- and there are not many of them on the planet," said Aiden Gomez, a former Google researcher who founded Cohere, an start-up that has built technology to ChatGPT.
In 2019, Mr. Altman told The New York Times that most of Microsoft's $ 1 billion investment came in the form of the computing power OpenAI needs -- and that Microsoft would eventually become the lab's sole source of computing power.
Microsoft and OpenAI have built a new kind of supercomputer specifically for ChatGPT and other generative A.I. technologies. That means Microsoft can readily offer these systems to its own customers.
Microsoft and OpenAI hope they can improve these systems by training them on larger amounts of data and most experts agree their skills will improve. Right now, Microsoft acknowledges, they can "hallucinate" answers by mixing fact and fiction.
Speaking in India last week, Mr. Nadella presented data that indicated as much as 10 percent of all data could be A.I.-generated in just three years, which could lead to as much as $ 7 billion in revenue for Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing product, said Gil Luria who researches Microsoft for the investment bank D.A. Davidson.
These technologies still come with a long list of flaws and question marks. They often produce toxic content, including misinformation, hate speech and images that are biased against women and people of color.
Microsoft, Google, Meta and other companies have been reluctant to release many of these technologies because of the potential damage to their established brands. Five years ago, Microsoft quickly backtracked after releasing a chatbot called Tay that generated racist, xenophobic and otherwise filthy language.
Mike Volpi, a partner with the venture capital firm Index Ventures, who was among the early investors in generative A.I., said the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership is one of the many contenders hoping to control where the technology is headed.
"There is an argument to be made that they all end up smelling the same," he said. "There is another argument that what OpenAI is doing is truly special and that all the money goes to them."

'A Wild Card': [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: General Muhoozi Kainerugaba has been positioning himself as Uganda's next leader. But his provocative tweets have unnerved Ugandans and put his father in a bind.
KAMPALA, Uganda -- He has boasted that he could capture the capital of neighboring Kenya in two weeks. He has offered a dowry of 100 cows to marry Italy's new female prime minister. And he has claimed that the majority of "non-white" people around the world supported Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
With a barrage of provocative, late-night Twitter posts in the last year, Muhoozi Kainerugaba -- the 48-year-old son of the president of Uganda, and a military general -- has unnerved Ugandans and regional allies, and become an embarrassment for President Yoweri Museveni, who has chided his eldest child publicly, apologized on his behalf and promised that his son would leave Twitter altogether.
But Gen. Kainerugaba is still tweeting, raising his public profile as he tries to position himself to succeed his father, a close Western military ally whose landlocked nation receives almost a billion dollars in development assistance each year from the United States. Gen. Kainerugaba has vowed not to "stop until we are in complete control" of Uganda.
His father has held an increasingly authoritarian grip on the country for 37 years, a six-term president who at 78 has already begun receiving endorsements to run in the 2026 elections. Ugandan political experts say he is unlikely ever to relinquish power.
But as President Museveni's vigor wanes, experts say he is looking to preserve his family's dominance and trying to line up his son as a successor. Yet he is coy about fully backing him, in part because of his exasperation with the stream of erratic tweets his son has shared with his over 650,000 followers, according to several Uganda analysts and Western officials.
"Even as he encourages him to become a public figure, Museveni now realizes that he is not in full control of his son," said a senior Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. "He is not in the same caliber politically as his father and he is quite self-absorbed and that informs people's assessment of whether he is suitable for the presidency."
The question of succession has taken center stage in Uganda, one of many African countries ruled by aging strongmen. Some African leaders have set up their children, wives or other relatives as successors. Other leaders have tried to lay the groundwork for successors, but failed -- as in Zimbabwe, Egypt and Angola, where the ruling dos Santos family lost control when its patriarch stepped down.
The Ugandan president has been testing his son's prospects with the public, political analysts say, as succession tensions build among ruling party cadres and the army. He has dispatched his son on diplomatic visits across Africa, promoted him to a full general and thrown him a lavish state dinner for his birthday last year.
"Due to Museveni's advancing age, there's a lot of pressure building on the question of succession and Muhoozi is an insurance policy," said Michael Mutyaba, a Ugandan researcher and political analyst. "He is meant to act as a shock absorber."
Gen. Kainerugaba declined multiple requests for an interview through a spokesman, and President Museveni's spokesman did not respond.
Since coming to power in 1986, Mr. Museveni has changed laws to stay in office, suspended dozens of nongovernmental organizations, and subjected activists and opposition members to arbitrary detention, disappearances and torture. Two years ago, the president declared victory after a bloody election replete with accusations of vote tampering.
The flood of tweets from Gen. Kainerugaba has revived questions about an alleged scheme, known as the "Muhoozi Project," to groom the president's son for power.
The government has denied that there ever was any such plan. But with the recent tweets, there is renewed apprehension about dynastic rule.
Mr. Museveni's family is deeply entrenched in power. His wife, Janet, is the minister of education and sports. His brother Salim Saleh is an influential businessman and serves as a military adviser. His son-in-law, Odrek Rwabwogo, is a presidential adviser who harbors political ambitions.
Gen. Kainerugaba has held several strategic positions in the military and is a special adviser to his father.
Last March, the general tweeted his intention to retire from the army, a precondition to running for office in Uganda. The decision caught military officials by surprise. He later retracted it, saying he will retire in eight years.
His offhand tweets about the war in Ukraine have especially discomfited his father, according to two people familiar with those discussions. Mr. Museveni has said he wished to remain neutral about the war in Ukraine. When Gen. Kainerugaba voiced support for President Vladimir V. Putin, the president stated that his son was "speaking for himself."
In October, when Gen. Kainerugaba threatened to capture the Kenyan capital, the president asked Kenyans for forgiveness. He then fired Gen. Kainerugaba as commander of the country's land forces -- although he promoted him from lieutenant general to a full general -- and said he directed him to stay off Twitter and cease commenting on other nations' internal affairs.
But his son said on Twitter that no one could "ban me from anything." He has said he will "definitely" become president.
His supporters have plastered his picture on billboards and posted fawning messages on social media. To expand his sphere of influence, experts say, he has privately supported the political candidacies of several friends and the appointment of others to critical government posts.
David Kabanda, a lawmaker with the ruling National Resistance Movement party and a staunch supporter of Gen. Kainerugaba, said in an interview, "It is high time for President Museveni to hand over power to the next generation."
Over the years, Mr. Museveni has amended the constitution, to remove presidential term and age limits, allowing him to retain power. He could similarly lay the groundwork for his son's eventual accession to power, Mr. Mutyaba, the analyst, said.
Last year, some members of the ruling party suggested the president should be elected by lawmakers and district officials instead of the general population, which would make it easier for his son to attain the high office.
"They will keep changing the rules and amending to get what they want," Mr. Mutyaba said.
Gen. Kainerugaba was born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, while his father fought the government of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. His name, Muhoozi, means "the avenger," the president has said. He has three younger sisters: Natasha, Patience and Diana.
He was shy at school, according to three friends, but showed interest in the debate club. He spent hours reading about military strategy and revolutionary leaders like Mao Zedong, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, they said. His friends described him as a good listener and generous to a fault.
But by his early 20s, Gen. Kainerugaba was predisposed to bombastic declarations, telling a conference in 1995 that Uganda will "never have lasting peace" unless wealthy Ugandans rule the nation.
He has said he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, in Britain, but the school declined to comment for privacy reasons. He finished a 10-month course in 2008 at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. He published a book on the history of modern Ugandan resistance battles.
His pugilistic approach to politics was evident after 2012, when he became the head of the restructured Special Forces Command, an elite private unit tasked with protecting Mr. Museveni and his interests. The outfit has been accused of carrying out human rights violations, particularly around the 2021 elections.
Gen. Kainerugaba has also personally faced accusations. He was named in a complaint alleging a wave of abductions and abuse, filed in the International Criminal Court by Bobi Wine, a musician turned politician who ran for president against Mr. Museveni in 2021.
And Kakwenza Rukirabashaija -- author of the books "The Greedy Barbarian" and "Banana Republic: Where Writing is Treasonous," -- said in an interview that after he wrote tweets criticizing the general and his father, security officers took him from his house after breaking in, whipped him, plucked his thighs with pliers and ordered him to dance almost all day.
He said Gen. Kainerugaba visited him in prison three times, and promised to give him "anything I wanted" as long as he didn't reveal his scars to anyone or speak to the press, and promised to remove "Banana Republic" from Amazon.
Gen. Kainerugaba's spokesman has denied the two met. After Mr. Rukirabashaija was released on bail last January, he fled to Germany.
"He only understands one language: violence," Mr. Rukirabashaija said.
Helen Epstein, the author of "Another Fine Mess: America, Uganda and the War on Terror," said Gen. Kainerugaba's intemperate tweets remind her of the bombastic rhetoric of Mr. Amin, the brutal former ruler of Uganda who killed tens of thousands of people and had threatened to annex parts of Kenya.
"Muhoozi has ambitions to run Uganda one day," Ms. Epstein said. For now, she added, "he is a wild card."

He then fired Kainerugaba as commander of the country’s land forces — although he promoted him from lieutenant general to a full general — and said he directed him to stay off Twitter and cease commenting on other nations’ internal affairs.
But his son said on Twitter that no one could “ban me from anything.” He has said he will “definitely” become president.
His supporters have plastered his picture on billboards and posted fawning messages on social media. To expand his sphere of influence, experts say, he has privately supported the political candidacies of several friends and the appointment of others to critical government posts.
David Kabanda, a lawmaker with the ruling National Resistance Movement party and a staunch supporter of Kainerugaba, said in an interview, “It is high time for President Museveni to hand over power to the next generation.”
Over the years, Museveni has amended the constitution, to remove presidential term and age limits, allowing him to retain power. He could similarly lay the groundwork for his son’s eventual accession to power, Mutyaba, the analyst, said.
Last year, some members of the ruling party suggested the president should be elected by lawmakers and district officials instead of the general population, which would make it easier for his son to attain the high office.
“They will keep changing the rules and amending to get what they want,” Mutyaba said.
Kainerugaba was born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, while his father fought the government of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. His name, Muhoozi, means “the avenger,” the president has said. He has three younger sisters: Natasha, Patience and Diana.
He was shy at school, according to three friends, but showed interest in the debate club. He spent hours reading about military strategy and revolutionary leaders like Mao Zedong, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, they said. His friends described him as a good listener and generous to a fault.
But by his early 20s, Kainerugaba was predisposed to bombastic declarations, telling a conference in 1995 that Uganda will “never have lasting peace” unless wealthy Ugandans rule the nation.
He has said he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, in Britain, but the school declined to comment for privacy reasons. He finished a 10-month course in 2008 at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He published a book on the history of modern Ugandan resistance battles.
His pugilistic approach to politics was evident after 2012, when he became the head of the restructured Special Forces Command, an elite private unit tasked with protecting Museveni and his interests. The outfit has been accused of carrying out human rights violations, particularly around the 2021 elections.
Kainerugaba has also personally faced accusations. He was named in a complaint alleging a wave of abductions and abuse, filed in the International Criminal Court by Bobi Wine, a musician turned politician who ran for president against Museveni in 2021.
And Kakwenza Rukirabashaija — author of the books “The Greedy Barbarian” and “Banana Republic: Where Writing is Treasonous” — said in an interview that after he wrote tweets criticizing the general and his father, security officers took him from his house after breaking in, whipped him, plucked his thighs with pliers and ordered him to dance almost all day.
He said Kainerugaba visited him in prison three times, and promised to give him “anything I wanted” as long as he didn’t reveal his scars to anyone or speak to the press, and promised to remove “Banana Republic” from Amazon.
Kainerugaba’s spokesperson has denied the two met. After Rukirabashaija was released on bail last January, he fled to Germany.
“He only understands one language: violence,” Rukirabashaija said.
Helen Epstein, the author of “Another Fine Mess: America, Uganda and the War on Terror,” said Kainerugaba’s intemperate tweets remind her of the bombastic rhetoric of Amin, the brutal former ruler of Uganda who killed tens of thousands of people and had threatened to annex parts of Kenya.
“Muhoozi has ambitions to run Uganda one day,” Epstein said. For now, she added, “he is a wild card.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: As the economy slows, a handful of prominent C.E.O.s have tried to put an end to remote work. But some economists say that even in a cooler labor market, working from home is likely to remain common.
The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business. If you don't already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here .
During the nearly three years since pandemic precautions pushed remote work into the mainstream, companies have been negotiating a "new normal" in an environment that some say gives workers an upper hand: Hiring has been difficult, quitting has been popular, and employers had been in a good position to accommodate workers' preferences.
That era is over. While the labor market remains tight even as many forecast that the United States will fall into a recession, most economists expect more layoffs and fewer job openings in the coming months as companies rethink how they operate. This week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its corporate work force, and Salesforce said it planned to lay off 10 percent of its employees, or about 8,000 staff members. Goldman Sachs is preparing to lay off as many as 4,000 people.
As the workplace shifts, some prominent chief executives see an opportunity to get their employees back in the office. In May 2021, David Solomon, C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, told workers to get ready to return the next month to encourage more in-person collaboration and shared culture. Elon Musk ended Twitter's "work from anywhere policy" in his first email to employees after acquiring the company last year, saying he would require them to work at least 40 hours a week from the office. Bob Iger stopped short of an office mandate when returning to Disney as chief executive in November, but he reportedly told employees that "I worry long term about the negative impact on people who have decided not to spend as much time at the office."
But is the pandemic-induced remote work experiment about to end? Economists studying the shift to more flexible workplaces say it is not likely despite the push by some of the world's most high-profile C.E.O.s.
Hybrid work is establishing itself as the new normal
Last year, remote work stabilized at well above prepandemic levels, according to data compiled by a group of researchers at Stanford University, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México.
In 2019, around 5 percent of full paid working days in the United States were completed remotely, according to census data. But when the research group started gathering data for the U.S. Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (S.W.A.A.), a monthly poll of workers, that proportion jumped to more than 60 percent in May 2020. For the past year, the percentage has been hovering around 30 percent.
"We are all back to prepandemic trends in online shopping, but permanently up on online work," said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford and a co-author of the monthly survey.
The most common remote work situation, according to the S.W.A.A. and a number of other surveys, is now hybrid work, with employees spending some days in the office and some working remotely. Companies, industries and individual situations vary greatly on preferences and the feasibility of remote work, but on average, both sides have similar ideas about the ideal amount of time to spend in the office.
In the December S.W.A.A. survey, workers able to do their jobs from home said they preferred to operate remotely about 2.8 days per week. Their employers planned to allow them to work from home about 2.3 days per week. That's not a big gap in expectations.
There are obvious reasons employees say they like working remotely: They want to avoid the time and costs of commuting; they focus better without office chatter; they feel it's better for their well-being to be at home. When McKinsey, the consultancy, asked 12,000 job seekers last year about their reasons for looking for a new job, "flexible working" came in just behind "greater pay or hours" and "better career opportunities."
What often gets glossed over -- and one reason some economists believe that a recession would have little impact on the shift in working arrangements -- is that allowing employees to operate outside of the office can also benefit companies.
In a survey conducted by ZipRecruiter, the employment search site, job seekers on average said they would take a 14 percent pay cut in order to work remotely.
While the labor market remains strong, the economy is slowing down, and companies are looking for ways to make their jobs more valuable without raising pay. And many of them say they're using remote work to do it.
"It's not that there won't be some loss of bargaining power by workers," said Steven Davis, a professor at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the S.W.A.A. "It's just that many employers have their own independent reasons to think that the shift, the partial shift, to remote work is beneficial for them as well."
Managers are finding it hard to reverse the changes
For a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Mr. Bloom, Mr. Davis and others asked the hundreds of senior business executives who are surveyed each month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta if they had expanded remote work as a way to "keep employees happy and to moderate wage-growth pressures." Thirty-eight percent said they had done so in the past 12 months, including half of executives working in sectors such as finance, insurance, real estate and professional services. Forty-one percent said they planned to do so in the next year.
The authors used executives' estimates for how much they saved in pay by offering remote work to conclude that it would cut companies' salary bill by 2 percent over two years.
"That's not huge," Mr. Davis said. "But what it suggests is that there are non-trivial benefits to many firms from remote work."
A downturn could even make remote work more, not less, sticky. Recruiting more widely, including in cities where the cost of living is lower than where a company is headquartered, could mean paying lower salaries (though in some industries, such as tech, there is some evidence that salaries in different cities are converging).
Workers with an option to log in remotely may also take fewer sick days or decide to work remotely when they would previously have taken a day off to attend a friend's wedding or extend a holiday.
Of course, there are costs to remote work, too. Managers and workers often disagree about which environment is most productive. And working virtually can involve security considerations, new software purchases and compliance headaches around hiring in multiple states or countries. But, Mr. Davis said, in a lot of cases, companies have already paid for those costs. "We had almost three years of experience doing this," he said.
Perhaps the most practical reason that companies may hold on to remote work in a recession is that it is difficult to revoke. Even Musk, a little more than a week after mandating full-time office work, reportedly clarified that all that was required of employees who wanted to work remotely was an approval from a manager willing to take responsibility for ensuring excellent work (albeit at the risk of being fired).
"Many, many companies in recent months have insisted that people come back to the office five days a week, only to reverse that mandate within about a week after hearing that they'd lose their best and brightest," said Julia Pollak, the chief economist ZipRecruiter.
Remote work, Ms. Pollak added, "is not just used as a sort of perk in a tight labor market that's going to go away in a slacker labor market."

How Do You Like to Watch Television?: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A decade of bingeing has transformed storytelling and viewing habits. But we may be starting to hit that transformation's limits.
This is not a review of "Kaleidoscope." One reason for this is that the Netflix heist series, which arrived on Sunday, is not especially noteworthy, except for one gimmick. The other reason has to do with the nature of that gimmick.
The episodes, set before and after an elaborate robbery attempt, are served to Netflix viewers in random order (except for the episode depicting the actual heist, which runs last). So in a way, I can't review the series as you might see it, because I can't know which of [tries to summon my knowledge of factorials from middle-school math] a lot of possible permutations you could experience.
That's the interesting part of "Kaleidoscope." And let's be honest, at this point, it's not that interesting! A few years ago, sure; the series would have seemed like a bold experiment in the ways new technology might change TV.
Now, for much the same reason, "Kaleidoscope" feels like a throwback. It's one in a series of attempts to use streaming to alter the space-time fabric of television, to make it less linear and in some cases more interactive -- many of which have gotten attention, but none of which have really stuck.
Netflix has been the platform most active in these experiments, maybe because it was the most invested in the idea that it was an alternative not only to cable or broadcast networks but also to the genre and business of television itself.
Its 2013 revival of "Arrested Development" was a kind of deconstructed puzzle, its episodes appearing out of chronological order and from different characters' points of view. Its interactive film/show/game "Black Mirror: Bandersnatch" allowed viewers to choose the path the story followed. So did the "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt" special "Kimmy vs. the Reverend"; the animated "Cat Burglar" added a trivia-game element. Netflix was not alone in this either, with Steven Soderbergh going the choose-your-own-adventure route in the HBO series/app "Mosaic."
After all this, a good decade or so into the streaming revolution, TV today looks -- well, it still looks a lot like TV. Attempts at interactivity have gotten no more traction than Smell-o-Vision, maybe in part because our culture already has a popular and relatively young form of interactive amusement, the video game. (One of those, "The Last of Us," is being adapted by HBO as a conventional TV drama.)
TV's dominant format continues to be the static season, in which episodes are served up in a set progression. Often -- even on streaming -- they arrive once a week. The only choosing viewers do is what to watch, when to watch and whether to fill their couch-side snack bowl with chips or pretzels.
In other ways, streaming has absolutely changed the business and aesthetics of TV. As I wrote in 2015, giving viewers the option to binge when they please has encouraged a form of storytelling more focused on the season and less on the episode. Netflix's philosophy of "the first season is the pilot" -- itself an outgrowth of the serial approach of networks like HBO -- has led to a more long-game form of narrative, and not only on streaming platforms.
Increasingly, TV series of the past decade have aimed less at hooking viewers from the first minutes than at getting them to sink in, as into quicksand. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Tony Gilroy, the showrunner of the "Star Wars" prequel series "Andor" on Disney+, dismissed "the idea that you have to wrap up every episode in a bow" and defended the series's slow-burn start as a necessary "investment." (Granted, it's easier to get audiences to pony up that investment when you're selling one of the world's most famous franchises.)
All this has made a difference for better and for worse. It has added to TV's bag of tricks, giving creators the option of making more unitary long-form works. (Among other things, the streaming era has been the heyday of the multi-hour limited series.) Other times it imposes the expectation of length where it's not needed. One thing "Kaleidoscope" has in common with many streaming series is the feeling of being a two-hour movie pitch that was repackaged and padded into a TV season.
The experience of TV, meanwhile, has become less tied to the cable box and the network schedule. A generation of viewers is now used to watching TV at the time, and in the portion size, of its choosing. FX, a pioneer of the High Cable Era of the early aughts, is now as much a boutique subplatform of Hulu as it is a cable channel. There is still a distinction between HBO (the premium channel) and HBO Max (the streamer), but I'm not sure anyone outside the TV business thinks much about it anymore.
Lately, however, it seems as if we're hitting the limits of how much change TV can handle and how much audiences want. It turns out that TV wants to be linear. Not necessarily in chronology -- since the flashbacks and -forwards of "Lost," TV has become suffused with in media res openings and Vonnegutian unstickings in time. But in almost every case you progress, scene by scene, episode by episode, through a narrative order chosen by a creator, not by you or by the roll of some automated dungeonmaster's eight-sided die.
Critics of build-your-own-TV experiments often use the restaurant analogy: You want the chef to prepare your dinner; you don't want to have to cook the ingredients yourself. But that doesn't mean you want to eat hamburgers every night for the rest of your life. Within that traditional structure -- a creative artist deciding what you get, in what order -- people are willing to change up the number of courses (episodes) or opt for a family-style experience in which the entire meal (season) arrives to the table at once.
This flexibility goes both ways. As more streaming competitors have come online, some have opted for a more, well, TV-like release schedule. Apple is fond of introducing series with a few episodes, then releasing one a week. Disney favors a one-at-a-time, tune-in-next-week pattern for its tent-pole Marvel and Star Wars series. Even Amazon, which once mirrored Netflix in dropping its seasons all at once, went with a weekly schedule for its mithril-plated Tolkien series, "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power."
There's a certain school of TV fan and critic -- call them the episodicists -- who will hail these changes as proof that the old ways are the right ways. TV needs tightly constructed individual episodes, goes the argument, and the audience craves the communal experience of tuning in at the same bat-time to the same bat-channel (or -platform).
I think something more nuanced is going on: Decision by decision, TV is collectively feeling its way toward figuring out which viewing experience works best for which kind of series. As the critic Kathryn VanArendonk wrote in Vulture, a well-crafted TV season is not simply "a ten-hour movie." But neither does every show in 2023 need to be structured and experienced like "Dragnet."
Some shows benefit from the giddy feeling of unwrapping a new present every week. "Game of Thrones," though its episodes only occasionally focused on single stories, might not have become as big a phenomenon without the weekly hype cycle.
On the other hand, FX on Hulu's "The Bear," whose entire season dropped at once last summer, prompted more buzz and discourse than many of FX's weekly series. It may be that this kind of dramedy -- character-based, relatively short, not driven by big plot detonations -- is better taken in one gulp.
Elsewhere in streaming, TV-like practices seem to be returning out of the sheer dollars-and-cents realization that the business is not limitless.
Netflix has gone from saving canceled shows to axing series like "1899" after a single season, like an old-time broadcaster with an itchy trigger finger. As for streaming as an infinite video library -- well, it's looking more finite, with titles like "Westworld" pulled from circulation to cut costs, in a return to the pre-VCR days when a canceled show simply vanished into memory.
For now, at least, streaming and TV seem to be meeting in a still-coalescing middle, with elements of media's future and its past. The talent is still flowing to streaming; the director Rian Johnson ("Knives Out"), for instance, is about to premiere his first series, "Poker Face," on Peacock. But rather than a mind-melting narrative experiment in the mold of his movie "Looper," it is a case-of-the-week detective story, à la NBC in the 1970s.
As for Netflix, amid recent signs that it can't keep growing explosively forever, it has introduced something that used to be anathema to it: a subscription tier with ads. A decade ago, Netflix defined our current conception of streaming. Its next phase may involve turning itself into TV.

For Film Trailers, Not the Same Old Song: [Correction]

Full text: Composers are increasingly in demand for trailerization -- reworking existing tracks by artists including Kate Bush, Nirvana and Kendrick Lamar to maximize their impact in film and TV previews.
David James Rosen's work has been streamed on YouTube hundreds of millions of times. He's played a crucial role in some of pop culture's biggest recent moments. But few people outside of the space where the entertainment and marketing industries overlap know his name.
As a composer, Rosen is at the forefront of the trailerization movement: He's in demand for his ability to rework existing songs to maximize their impact in trailers for films and TV shows.
He married vocals and motifs from Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill" to a thunderous version of the "Stranger Things" theme in the lead-up to the second volume of the show's fourth season. He intertwined the Nigerian singer Tems's cover of "No Woman No Cry" with Kendrick Lamar's "Alright" in the teaser for "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," symbolizing the meeting of the franchise's future and its legacy. He put a sinister singe on Taylor Swift's "It's Nice to Have a Friend" for the diabolical doll thriller "M3GAN." He added cosmic drama to Elton John's classic rock staple "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" for the upcoming "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."
As potential viewers are inundated with an ever-growing number of options, studios have limited chances to build anticipation for their projects. At the same time, technological advances have made it easier than ever for products to stand out. "People want their film to have its own identity," Rosen said in an interview at a Los Angeles coffee shop. "The genie's out of the bottle as far as the limitless ability to customize something for your film. Clients, studios, agencies, whatever, they all know that and like to take advantage of it."
Rosen spent his 20s playing guitar in the New Jersey band the Parlor Mob. After moving to L.A. in 2014, he got a job as the in-house composer at a trailer house -- the specialized production companies behind these promos. Three years later, he co-founded Totem, a music library that creates custom tracks for trailers. Much of Rosen's output is original compositions, but the ones that get the most attention are his overhauls.
"Almost never does a song just drop into a trailer and work," he said. "Maybe it needs to feel more epic or more emotional, or maybe it needs to feel subtler with things pulled away."
Trailerization is a relatively new term and the distinctions within it are malleable. There are reimaginations, which are usually instrumental covers by composers. There are overlays, where elements are added to a song in varying degrees. Then there are remixes, where the source material is distinctly altered, often to shift the context.
Some distinguish between remixes and overlays by what the composer has to play with. If there's a full set of stems -- the separated digital parts that comprise a song -- it's a remix. If stems aren't available, it's an overlay.
Occasionally composers will be asked to create "invisible overlays," where they make adjustments that are imperceptible to most listeners but nudge a song toward a more wide-screen sound.
The trailerization process is now so common that even when a trailer uses the film's original score, it too will be adjusted. "Trailers are a mini version of the movie," said Cato, the one-named composer whose credits include performing a system update on Vangelis for the "Blade Runner 2049" trailer and giving Guns N' Roses an anguished-turned-pulverizing remix for Jason Momoa's Netflix revenge film "Sweet Girl."
"You have to suck people into the theater and tell a story in two-and-a-half minutes," Cato added. "That is so intense and builds so quickly that most music written for the actual movie will be way too long and drawn out."
IN THE PAST, trailers often relied on the scores of previously released films, but that practice has basically become verboten. Starting in the late 1970s, the composer John Beal pioneered original scores for trailers, but that required a recording studio full of musicians, making it a costly, resource-heavy endeavor. Today, with developments in software, it's easier than ever to simulate those sounds.
"I could sit at my computer at home and you wouldn't know that there wasn't a 100-piece orchestra there," Rosen said. "You couldn't do that 10 years ago."

Many point to the trailer for "The Social Network," from 2010 -- which featured a Belgian women's choir singing Radiohead's "Creep" -- as the origin of what became the trailerization trend. Its success incited a deluge of trailers using slow and sad covers of well-known songs, usually featuring female vocalists. Recent examples include Liza Anne's version of "Dreams" by the Cranberries for "Aftersun" and Bellsaint's interpretation of R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion" for the second season of the "Chucky" TV series.
Sanaz Lavaedian, the senior vice president of music for the trailer house Mocean, said that when she entered the industry in 2011, there was still a lot of resistance from artists who didn't want their music used for commercial purposes. Covers provided a workaround. Now, as more musicians are struggling to make a living, they're often more open to trailers not just using their music but modifying it.
"There were so many bands that didn't think licensing was cool, so they never let us do it," Lavaedian said. "Now they're like, 'Oh, we're going to make half a million dollars on this? Nevermind."'
Many high profile trailerizations are applied to songs that are decades old: Remixes and overlays allow the trailers to tap into the nostalgia evoked by the original. "If we were able to remix an Elton John song or a Beatles song, these are iconic artists," Lavaedian said. "The second you hear their voice, you know who it is, and there's a lot of weight in that. More weight than if it were a cover."
The composer Bryce Miller's big breakthrough came in 2019 with the "Godzilla: King of the Monsters" trailer, which featured his custom orchestral rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" atop images of kaiju carnage. His subsequent credits include a modernization of Blondie's "Heart of Glass" for "House of Gucci," an orchestral blend of the Rolling Stones' "Paint It Black" and the "Addams Family Theme" for "Wednesday" and a haunting overlay for Nirvana's "Something in the Way" in "The Batman" trailer.
"As soon as I can get rid of dated-sounding guitars and drums, I can build a more contemporary production that is pulling from more pop music sounds," Miller said. "Older recordings sonically are a little thin and lack the heft that so many contemporary songs have."

Unique remixes began appearing in trailers going back to the mid-2010s, but it wasn't until the one for Jordan Peele's 2019 film "Us" that studios and audiences began to really take notice. In the fresh interpretation, with its piercing strings and moody atmospherics, a celebratory weed rap by the Oakland duo Luniz became deeply unsettling.
"Every once in a while we get one of those game-changer trailers," Lavaedian said. The "Us" trailer "is taking a song and deconstructing it down to its bones and then constructing it again to do what that film needed it to do. It was kind of groundbreaking."
MARK WOOLLEN, THE founder of the trailer house Mark Woollen & Associates, specializes in award-season films and was responsible for that transformative "Social Network" trailer. New York magazine once called him "the uncontested auteur of the trailer era."
In a phone interview, Woollen noted that in contemporary trailers, omniscient narration has largely disappeared (that means no more hackneyed "In a world ..." setups) and there's less dialogue from the film. Trailers "can be more impressionistic and elliptical in their storytelling," he said. "It's more about creating a feeling in a lot of the work."
As a result, the trailer's soundtrack has become increasingly crucial. "Music is sometimes 80 to 90 percent of the process to us," Woollen said. "It's trying to cast that right piece of music that's going to inspire and dictate rhythm and set tone and inform character and story, and hopefully make an impression."
For Amazon's recent love triangle "My Policeman," Woollen used Cat Power's "Sea of Love," which has become a romantic favorite among aging millennials. Though Cat Power's original interpretation was stripped down to just the singer Chan Marshall's voice and strums on an autoharp, Woollen had a composer overlay swelling strings as the drama became more fraught.
Beyond providing the vibes, a song is often selected for a trailer because the lyrics convey the film's narrative themes. Woollen didn't just select "Sea of Love" because it is mysterious and seductive. He was equally guided by the refrain "I want to tell you how much I love you" and the ambiguousness of who that "you" might be.
In Marvel's "The Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" trailer, as the heroes realize the size of the predicament they've gotten themselves into, the sound design emphasizes Elton John singing, "I should have stayed on the farm/I should have listened to my old man."
Deciding which song a trailer uses and how it's employed can involve studio marketing executives, the filmmakers, the team at the trailer house and the composer. A trailer's creation can take years and is often covered by restrictive nondisclosure agreements, preventing the people behind it from discussing the details of making it, even after it has been released.
Because the material is so protected, the musicians rarely see the images that will be included in the trailer. Instead they have to rely on a music supervisor or creative director at a trailer house to guide them through inception and multiple rounds of revisions. "We're literally dealing with billions of dollars in unreleased assets," Lavaedian said of the footage from the films. "There's no way we can send that to a composer."
UNLESS YOU KNOW where to look on the internet, the pieces made by trailer composers are largely uncredited, and sometimes contractually so. Trailerizations are created "to live exclusively in the trailer," Rosen said. "They serve as a piece of marketing."
But that may be changing.
When the agency Trailer Park approached Miller about doing a trailerization for the first volume of the fourth season of "Stranger Things," he was told the general plot and tone of the episodes. He'd long wanted to do something with Journey's "Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)" and it turned out the song was on the agency's shortlist as well.
After spending months on his ominous remix, it made it to the final stages of the approval process where the original musicians had to sign off. Steve Perry, the song's singer, loved it and came to Miller's studio to help construct an extended remix. Then he got Netflix to release both versions on the official soundtrack, with Miller's name attached.
Miller called Perry inspiring and a joy to work with. "He's also like a runaway train. As soon as we finished 'Stranger Things,' he's like, 'What are we doing next?"' The pair collaborated again on a trailerization of Journey's "Any Way You Want It" for the Hulu series "Welcome to Chippendales."
Where will trailerization at large head next? Recently, there's been an interest in 1990s alternative rock hits, with remixes of Spacehog and the Toadies appearing in trailers for "Guardian of the Galaxy Volume 3" and "The Midnight Club." In the promo for "Babylon," the team of composers known as Superhuman created a Jazz Age-influenced interpretation of David Bowie's "Fame" that's almost as nutty as the film itself.
With decades of material to work with, Rosen hopes the trend continues. "There's more opportunity for creativity from me and other people," he said. "I view it as a new life for a lot of these artists' songs."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Composers are increasingly in demand for trailerization -- reworking existing tracks by artists including Kate Bush, Nirvana and Kendrick Lamar to maximize their impact in film and TV previews.
David James Rosen's work has been streamed on YouTube hundreds of millions of times. He's played a crucial role in some of pop culture's biggest recent moments. But few people outside of the space where the entertainment and marketing industries overlap know his name.
As a composer, Rosen is at the forefront of the trailerization movement: He's in demand for his ability to rework existing songs to maximize their impact in trailers for films and TV shows.
He married vocals and motifs from Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill" to a thunderous version of the "Stranger Things" theme in the lead-up to the second volume of the show's fourth season. He intertwined the Nigerian singer Tems's cover of "No Woman No Cry" with Kendrick Lamar's "Alright" in the teaser for "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," symbolizing the meeting of the franchise's future and its legacy. He put a sinister singe on Taylor Swift's "It's Nice to Have a Friend" for the diabolical doll thriller "M3GAN." He added cosmic drama to Elton John's classic rock staple "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" for the upcoming "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."
As potential viewers are inundated with an ever-growing number of options, studios have limited chances to build anticipation for their projects. At the same time, technological advances have made it easier than ever for products to stand out. "People want their film to have its own identity," Rosen said in an interview at a Los Angeles coffee shop. "The genie's out of the bottle as far as the limitless ability to customize something for your film. Clients, studios, agencies, whatever, they all know that and like to take advantage of it."
Rosen spent his 20s playing guitar in the New Jersey band the Parlor Mob. After moving to L.A. in 2014, he got a job as the in-house composer at a trailer house -- the specialized production companies behind these promos. Three years later, he co-founded Totem, a music library that creates custom tracks for trailers. Much of Rosen's output is original compositions, but the ones that get the most attention are his overhauls.
"Almost never does a song just drop into a trailer and work," he said. "Maybe it needs to feel more epic or more emotional, or maybe it needs to feel subtler with things pulled away."
Trailerization is a relatively new term and the distinctions within it are malleable. There are reimaginations, which are usually instrumental covers by composers. There are overlays, where elements are added to a song in varying degrees. Then there are remixes, where the source material is distinctly altered, often to shift the context.
Some distinguish between remixes and overlays by what the composer has to play with. If there's a full set of stems -- the separated digital parts that comprise a song -- it's a remix. If stems aren't available, it's an overlay.
Occasionally composers will be asked to create "invisible overlays," where they make adjustments that are imperceptible to most listeners but nudge a song toward a more wide-screen sound.
The trailerization process is now so common that even when a trailer uses the film's original score, it too will be adjusted. "Trailers are a mini version of the movie," said Cato, the one-named composer whose credits include performing a system update on Vangelis for the "Blade Runner 2049" trailer and giving Guns N' Roses an anguished-turned-pulverizing remix for Jason Momoa's Netflix revenge film "Sweet Girl."
"You have to suck people into the theater and tell a story in two-and-a-half minutes," Cato added. "That is so intense and builds so quickly that most music written for the actual movie will be way too long and drawn out."
IN THE PAST, trailers often relied on the scores of previously released films, but that practice has basically become verboten. Starting in the late 1970s, the composer John Beal pioneered original scores for trailers, but that required a recording studio full of musicians, making it a costly, resource-heavy endeavor. Today, with developments in software, it's easier than ever to simulate those sounds.
"I could sit at my computer at home and you wouldn't know that there wasn't a 100-piece orchestra there," Rosen said. "You couldn't do that 10 years ago."

Many point to the trailer for "The Social Network," from 2010 -- which featured a Belgian women's choir singing Radiohead's "Creep" -- as the origin of what became the trailerization trend. Its success incited a deluge of trailers using slow and sad covers of well-known songs, usually featuring female vocalists. Recent examples include Liza Anne's version of "Dreams" by the Cranberries for "Aftersun" and Bellsaint's interpretation of R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion" for the second season of the "Chucky" TV series.
Sanaz Lavaedian, the senior vice president of music for the trailer house Mocean, said that when she entered the industry in 2011, there was still a lot of resistance from artists who didn't want their music used for commercial purposes. Covers provided a workaround. Now, as more musicians are struggling to make a living, they're often more open to trailers not just using their music but modifying it.

With the Burial of His Predecessor, Francis Is Left Alone, and Unbound: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Liberal supporters of Francis, a pope never shy about exercising power, now anticipate a late-breaking season of change.
VATICAN CITY -- Since the first day of his papacy nearly a decade ago, Pope Francis has had to navigate an unprecedented complication in the Roman Catholic Church: coexisting with his retired predecessor in the same Vatican gardens. Supporters of Francis studiously played down the two-pontiff anomaly, but it generated confusion, especially when conservative acolytes of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI sought to wrap their fervent opposition in their leader's white robes.
Now, with the burial of Benedict on Thursday, Francis, never bashful about exercising his power, is for the first time unbound.
"Now, I'm sure he'll take it over," said Oswald Gracias, the archbishop of Mumbai, as he walked around St. Peter's Square before Benedict's funeral Mass.
Some liberal supporters of Francis, who has often balked in the face of advancing major overhauls, are raising expectations for a late-breaking season of change.
Many bishops and cardinals in the Vatican are convinced "he's thinking ahead," said Gerard O'Connell, the Vatican correspondent for America magazine. "What changes now is that the opposition will not have the rallying figure, manipulating Benedict. Francis has a very clear agenda."
Mr. O'Connell, the author of "The Election of Pope Francis: An Inside Story of the Conclave That Changed History," envisioned an immediate future of swifter personnel decisions and the placing of more lay Catholics in power. He said there was talk about a new document on morality, sexuality and contraception. He also predicted the revisiting of major issues.
Francis has already allowed debate on key, and previously taboo, topics like being more inclusive to gay people and giving women larger roles in the church. In 2021, he seemed poised to allow married men in far-flung areas like the Amazon to become priests. While an unexpected expression of opposition from Benedict, or those writing in his name, perhaps contributed to Francis pulling back, he left the door open.
Already absolute, Francis' leadership in the church is increasingly fortified by a hierarchy in his image. By the end of the year, Francis will almost certainly pack the College of Cardinals with handpicked appointees. His chosen prelates will most likely then make up two-thirds of the body, the threshold necessary for electing the next pope.
That number could click even higher if he remains in power through the end of 2024, when the second of two major meetings of the world's bishops he has convened will end. Those so-called Synods, deeply disparaged by Benedict's wing, are the fulfillment of Francis' vision to foster a consensus for big changes in the church.
While that all remains in the future, what seems certain is that Francis seems eager to put an end to grievances about the past. On Friday, a day after the burial of his predecessor, Francis seemed to try to quell the grumbling by Benedict's loyalists, who had accused him of giving Benedict short shrift in his funeral homily and of having disappointed the pope emeritus repeatedly over the past decade, by quoting Benedict XVI's own words about avoiding the petty and mundane and putting faith above all else.
In a remark that has been widely interpreted in the Vatican as a direct response to the complaints of Benedict's closest collaborator, Archbishop Georg Gänswein -- who has a book coming out -- Francis said during the Mass, "Let us worship God, not ourselves; let us worship God and not the false idols that seduce by the allure of prestige or power, or the allure of false news."
The new era also ended the strange business of church officials denying any awkwardness in the two-pope epoch.
Cardinal Gracias said that there was continuity between Benedict, whom he admired, and who had elevated him to Cardinal, and Francis, of whom he said Benedict was a "big supporter."
"Pope Francis was not being influenced" by Benedict or his coterie, said Cardinal Juan José Omella of Spain on the day of Benedict's funeral.
"There were not two popes," agreed Mario Iceta Gavicagogeascoa, the archbishop of Burgos, Spain. Benedict had withdrawn in his monastery, and so "there was only one pope, Francis."
But after Benedict's death, the calculus in the Vatican has clearly changed.
"It would be difficult to have two emeritus popes," a French bishop, Jean-Yves Riocreux, said on Thursday, adding that the major difference for Francis after Benedict's death was "now he can resign."
While Francis has entertained the prospect of retiring, Vatican analysts say that if his health holds out and he keeps enjoying the job of being pope, it is unlikely he would rush to hand things over to a successor who could undo his legacy, just as he has chipped away at Benedict's.
Indeed, conservative critics of Francis are already fearing the worst.
"Seems that Francis declared Year Zero, goodbye to all that, etc.," Rod Dreher, a hard-right traditionalist who left the church but remains active in its politics, declared Thursday on Twitter after what he considered a paltry homily to Benedict by Francis. "Bad times coming for faithful orthodox Catholics."
But some Vatican analysts hold a countervailing view that Francis will not be the only force with a freer hand now. Frustrated conservatives and traditionalists, they say, will no longer feel chastened by Benedict, who at times provided cover to Francis by telling his own followers to cool it. Instead, with Francis having already brought down the hammer on their beloved Old Latin Masses, some predict they will wage an even more open war against Francis.
Francis does not seem too worried. He has mostly shrugged off their critiques, and in 2019, he responded to a question about a potential breaking off by arch conservatives in the Catholic church by saying, "I pray there are no schisms, but I'm not scared."
More than conservative opposition, what has held Francis back on major issues, Mr. O'Connell said, was the search for a collegial consensus to bring the whole church forward on the major changes. "His aim is to keep the unity of the church," Mr. O'Connell said. "And that is the constraint."
Francis hopes to secure that consensus, or something close to it, over two major meetings of bishops in the coming two years. But in the Vatican, two years is plenty of time for something to go wrong and slow Francis down.
To the chagrin of his critics, Francis has demonstrated a political agility, media savvy and seeming imperviousness to the scandals and crises that so hobbled Benedict during his eight-year papacy.
Benedict frequently stumbled with political missteps. He openly acknowledged he was no administrator and seemed to prefer the books of a theologian to the platform of the globe's most powerful pastor. He surrounded himself with intrigue-prone Italians in the Curia, the Roman bureaucracy that governs the church, and ultimately resigned amid tawdry Vatican scandals, including the theft of his documents by a butler.
By contrast, Francis relies on a few trusted clerics, often Jesuits like him, who operate outside the traditional Vatican power structure. He has shown an ability to bounce back from errors and has managed to keep the usual Vatican intrigue at bay with a mix of good hires and draconian governance.
If with Benedict tongues wagged, with Francis heads have rolled.
When an embarrassing scandal erupted in 2020 about the possible misuse of funds to buy an apartment building in London, Francis publicly humiliated one of his top cardinals and stripped him of his privileges, including voting in the conclave.
And on a more substantive crisis, when Francis wrongly sided with his bishops in Chile over sex abuse victims, whom he accused of "calumny," he reversed himself, ordered an investigation and "wound up firing basically half" of the bishops in Chile, said Joshua J. McElwee, an editor at The National Catholic Reporter and a co-editor of "A Pope Francis Lexicon," a collection of essays about the pope.
"He's shown an incredible ability to change his mind and to adapt to learning that he was wrong," he said.
Or as John L. Allen Jr., the editor of Crux, a news site specializing in coverage of the Vatican and the Catholic Church, put it, in more political terms, Francis and his team "can see a train wreck coming and try to get out ahead of it in a way that Benedict and his team was never able to do."
That crisis-management savvy, clear agenda and now fragmented conservative opposition has put Francis in a position to make the changes his supporters have so hungered for.
Alberto Fernandez, a priest in Madrid who had traveled to Rome to attend Benedict's funeral, said that "with time, it became usual" to see two popes in the Vatican. Now that there is one again, he expects Francis to stay on the same path.
"The pope has been Francis for almost 10 years," he said. "That was the change."

VATICAN CITY — Since the first day of his papacy nearly a decade ago, Pope Francis has had to navigate an unprecedented complication in the Catholic Church: coexisting with his retired predecessor in the same Vatican gardens. Supporters of Francis studiously played down the two-pontiff anomaly, but it generated confusion, especially when conservative acolytes of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI sought to wrap their fervent opposition in their leader’s white robes.
Now, with the burial of Benedict on Thursday, Francis, never bashful about exercising his power, is for the first time unbound.
“Now, I’m sure he’ll take it over,” said Oswald Gracias, archbishop of Mumbai, as he walked around St. Peter’s Square before Benedict’s funeral Mass.
Some liberal supporters of Francis’, who has often balked in the face of advancing major overhauls, are raising expectations for a late-breaking season of change.
Many bishops and cardinals in the Vatican are convinced “he’s thinking ahead,” said Gerard O’Connell, the Vatican correspondent for America magazine. “What changes now is that the opposition will not have the rallying figure, manipulating Benedict. Francis has a very clear agenda.”
O’Connell, the author of “The Election of Pope Francis: An Inside Story of the Conclave That Changed History,” envisioned an immediate future of swifter personnel decisions and the placing of more lay Catholics in power. He said there was talk about a new document on morality, sexuality and contraception. He also predicted the revisiting of major issues.
Francis has already allowed debate on key, and previously taboo, topics such as being more inclusive to gay people and giving women larger roles in the church. In 2021, he seemed poised to allow married men in far-flung areas such as the Amazon to become priests. Although an unexpected expression of opposition from Benedict, or those writing in his name, perhaps contributed to Francis’ pulling back, he left the door open.
Already absolute, Francis’ leadership in the church is increasingly fortified by a hierarchy in his image. By the end of the year, Francis will almost certainly pack the College of Cardinals with hand-picked appointees. His chosen prelates will most likely then make up two-thirds of the body, the threshold necessary for electing the next pope.
That number could click even higher if he remains in power through the end of 2024, when the second of two major meetings of the world’s bishops he has convened will end. Those so-called synods, deeply disparaged by Benedict’s wing, are the fulfillment of Francis’ vision to foster a consensus for big changes in the church.
While that all remains in the future, what seems certain is that Francis seems eager to put an end to grievances about the past. On Friday, the day after the burial of his predecessor, Francis seemed to try to quell the grumbling by Benedict’s loyalists, who had accused him of giving Benedict short shrift in his funeral homily and of having disappointed the pope emeritus repeatedly over the past decade, by quoting Benedict’s own words about avoiding the petty and mundane and putting faith above all else.
In a remark that has been widely interpreted in the Vatican as a direct response to the complaints of Benedict’s closest collaborator, Archbishop Georg Gänswein — who has a book coming out — Francis said during the Mass, “Let us worship God, not ourselves; let us worship God and not the false idols that seduce by the allure of prestige or power, or the allure of false news.”
The new era also ended the strange business of church officials denying any awkwardness in the two-pope era.
Gracias said there was continuity between Benedict, whom he admired, and who had elevated him to cardinal, and Francis, of whom he said Benedict was a “big supporter.”
“Pope Francis was not being influenced” by Benedict or his coterie, said Cardinal Juan José Omella of Spain on the day of Benedict’s funeral.
“There were not two popes,” agreed Mario Iceta Gavicagogeascoa, archbishop of Burgos, Spain. Benedict had withdrawn in his monastery, and so “there was only one pope, Francis.”
But after Benedict’s death, the calculus in the Vatican has clearly changed.
“It would be difficult to have two emeritus popes,” a French bishop, Jean-Yves Riocreux, said Thursday, adding that the major difference for Francis after Benedict’s death was that “now he can resign.”
Although Francis has entertained the prospect of retiring, Vatican analysts say that if his health holds out and he keeps enjoying the job of being pope, it is unlikely he would rush to hand things over to a successor who could undo his legacy, just as he has chipped away at Benedict’s.
Indeed, conservative critics of Francis’ are already fearing the worst.
“Seems that Francis declared Year Zero, goodbye to all that, etc.,” Rod Dreher, a hard-right traditionalist who left the church but remains active in its politics, declared Thursday on Twitter after what he considered a paltry homily to Benedict by Francis. “Bad times coming for faithful orthodox Catholics.”
But some Vatican analysts hold a countervailing view that Francis will not be the only force with a freer hand now. Frustrated conservatives and traditionalists, they say, will no longer feel chastened by Benedict, who at times provided cover to Francis by telling his own followers to cool it. Instead, with Francis having already brought down the hammer on their beloved old Latin Masses, some predict that they will wage an even more open war against Francis.
Francis does not seem too worried. He has mostly shrugged off their critiques, and in 2019, he responded to a question about a potential breaking off by archconservatives in the Catholic Church by saying, “I pray there are no schisms, but I’m not scared.”
More than conservative opposition, what has held Francis back on major issues, O’Connell said, was the search for a collegial consensus to bring the whole church forward on the major changes. “His aim is to keep the unity of the church,” O’Connell said. “And that is the constraint.”
Francis hopes to secure that consensus, or something close to it, over two major meetings of bishops in the coming two years. But in the Vatican, two years is plenty of time for something to go wrong and slow Francis down.
To the chagrin of his critics, Francis has demonstrated a political agility, media savvy and seeming imperviousness to the scandals and crises that so hobbled Benedict during his eight-year papacy.
Benedict frequently stumbled with political missteps. He openly acknowledged he was no administrator and seemed to prefer the books of a theologian to the platform of the globe’s most powerful pastor. He surrounded himself with intrigue-prone Italians in the Curia, which is the Roman bureaucracy that governs the church, and ultimately resigned amid tawdry Vatican scandals, including the theft of his documents by a butler.
By contrast, Francis relies on a few trusted clerics, often Jesuits like him, who operate outside the traditional Vatican power structure. He has shown an ability to bounce back from errors and has managed to keep the usual Vatican intrigue at bay with a mix of good hires and draconian governance.
If with Benedict tongues wagged, with Francis heads have rolled.
When an embarrassing scandal erupted in 2020 about the possible misuse of funds to buy an apartment building in London, Francis publicly humiliated one of his top cardinals and stripped him of his privileges, including voting in the conclave.
And on a more substantive crisis, when Francis wrongly sided with his bishops in Chile over sex abuse victims, whom he accused of “calumny,” he reversed himself, ordered an investigation and “wound up firing basically half” of the bishops in Chile, said Joshua McElwee, editor of the National Catholic Reporter and co-editor of “A Pope Francis Lexicon,” a collection of essays about the pope.
“He’s shown an incredible ability to change his mind and to adapt to learning that he was wrong,” he said.
Or as John Allen Jr., editor of Crux, a news site specializing in coverage of the Vatican and the Catholic Church, put it, in more political terms: Francis and his team “can see a train wreck coming and try to get out ahead of it in a way that Benedict and his team was never able to do.”
That crisis management savvy, clear agenda and now-fragmented conservative opposition has put Francis in a position to make the changes his supporters have so hungered for.
Alberto Fernandez, a priest in Madrid who had traveled to Rome to attend Benedict’s funeral, said that “with time, it became usual” to see two popes in the Vatican. Now that there is one again, he expects Francis to stay on the same path.
“The pope has been Francis for almost 10 years,” he said. “That was the change.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Getting Rid of Remote Work Will Take More Than a Downturn

During the nearly three years since pandemic precautions pushed remote work into the mainstream, companies have been negotiating a “new normal” in an environment that some say gives workers an upper hand: Hiring has been difficult, quitting has been popular and employers had been in a good position to accommodate workers’ preferences.
That era is over. While the labor market remains tight even as many forecast that the United States will fall into a recession, most economists expect more layoffs and fewer job openings in the coming months as companies rethink how they operate. This past week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs, or about 6% of its corporate workforce, and Salesforce said it planned to lay off 10% of its employees, or about 8,000 staff members. Goldman Sachs is preparing to lay off as many as 4,000 people.
As the workplace shifts, some prominent CEOs see an opportunity to get their employees back in the office. In May 2021, David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, told workers to get ready to return the next month to encourage more in-person collaboration and shared culture. Elon Musk ended Twitter’s “work from anywhere policy” in his first email to employees after acquiring the company last year, saying he would require them to work at least 40 hours a week from the office. Bob Iger stopped short of an office mandate when returning to Disney as CEO in November, but he reportedly told employees that “I worry long term about the negative impact on people who have decided not to spend as much time at the office.”
But is the pandemic-induced remote work experiment about to end? Economists studying the shift to more flexible workplaces say it is not likely despite the push by some of the world’s most high-profile CEOs.
Hybrid work is establishing itself as the new normal.
Last year, remote work stabilized at well above pre-pandemic levels, according to data compiled by a group of researchers at Stanford University, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México.
In 2019, around 5% of full paid working days in the United States were completed remotely, according to census data. But when the research group started gathering data for the U.S. Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA), a monthly poll of workers, that proportion jumped to more than 60% in May 2020. For the past year, the percentage has been hovering around 30%.
“We are all back to pre-pandemic trends in online shopping but permanently up on online work,” said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford and a co-author of the monthly survey.
The most common remote work situation, according to the SWAA and a number of other surveys, is now hybrid work, with employees spending some days in the office and some working remotely. Companies, industries and individual situations vary greatly on preferences and the feasibility of remote work, but on average, both sides have similar ideas about the ideal amount of time to spend in the office.
In the December SWAA survey, workers able to do their jobs from home said they preferred to operate remotely about 2.8 days per week. Their employers planned to allow them to work from home about 2.3 days per week. That’s not a big gap in expectations.
There are obvious reasons employees say they like working remotely: They want to avoid the time and costs of commuting; they focus better without office chatter; they feel it’s better for their well-being to be at home. When McKinsey, a consultancy, asked 12,000 job seekers last year about their reasons for looking for a new job, “flexible working” came in just behind “greater pay or hours” and “better career opportunities.”
What often gets glossed over — and one reason some economists believe that a recession would have little impact on the shift in working arrangements — is that allowing employees to operate outside the office can also benefit companies.
In a survey conducted by ZipRecruiter, an employment search site, job seekers on average said they would take a 14% pay cut in order to work remotely.
While the labor market remains strong, the economy is slowing down, and companies are looking for ways to make their jobs more valuable without raising pay. And many of them say they’re using remote work to do it.
“It’s not that there won’t be some loss of bargaining power by workers,” said Steven Davis, a professor at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the SWAA. “It’s just that many employers have their own independent reasons to think that the shift, the partial shift, to remote work is beneficial for them as well.”
Managers are finding it hard to reverse the changes.
For a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Bloom, Davis and others asked the hundreds of senior business executives who are surveyed each month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta if they had expanded remote work as a way to “keep employees happy and to moderate wage-growth pressures.” Thirty-eight percent said they had done so in the past 12 months, including half of executives working in sectors such as finance, insurance, real estate and professional services; and 41% said they planned to do so in the next year.
The authors used executives’ estimates for how much they saved in pay by offering remote work to conclude that it would cut companies’ salary bill by 2% over two years.
“That’s not huge,” Davis said. “But what it suggests is that there are nontrivial benefits to many firms from remote work.”
A downturn could even make remote work more, not less, sticky. Recruiting more widely, including in cities where the cost of living is lower than where a company is headquartered, could mean paying lower salaries (although in some industries, such as tech, there is some evidence that salaries in different cities are converging).
Workers with an option to log in remotely may also take fewer sick days or decide to work remotely when they would previously have taken a day off to attend a friend’s wedding or extend a holiday.
Of course, there are costs to remote work, too. Managers and workers often disagree about which environment is most productive. And working virtually can involve security considerations, new software purchases and compliance headaches around hiring in multiple states or countries. But, Davis said, in a lot of cases, companies have already paid for those costs. “We had almost three years of experience doing this,” he said.
Perhaps the most practical reason that companies may hold on to remote work in a recession is that it is difficult to revoke. Even Musk, a little more than a week after mandating full-time office work, reportedly clarified that all that was required of employees who wanted to work remotely was an approval from a manager willing to take responsibility for ensuring excellent work (albeit at the risk of being fired).
“Many, many companies in recent months have insisted that people come back to the office five days a week, only to reverse that mandate within about a week after hearing that they’d lose their best and brightest,” said Julia Pollak, the chief economist ZipRecruiter.
Remote work, Pollak added, “is not just used as a sort of perk in a tight labor market that’s going to go away in a slacker labor market.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Hiring Is Healthy But Pace Receded During December: [National Desk]

Full text: The Federal Reserve's moves to cool the economy with higher interest rates seem to be taking gentle hold. Wage growth lost momentum.
The U.S. economy produced jobs at a slower but still comfortable rate at the end of 2022, as higher interest rates and changing consumer habits downshifted the labor market without bringing it to a halt.
Employers added 223,000 jobs in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department reported on Friday, in line with economists' expectations although the smallest gain since President Biden took office.
The gradual cooling indicates that the economy may be coming back into balance after years of pandemic-era disruptions -- so far with limited pain for workers. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent, back to its level from early 2020, which matched a low last seen in 1969.
"If the U.S. economy is slipping into recession, nobody told the labor market," said Chris Varvares, co-head of U.S. economics for S&P Global Market Intelligence, noting that the December number is still nearly double the approximately 100,000 jobs needed to keep up with population growth.
Stocks jumped on the news. The S&P 500 gained 2.3 percent, reflecting expectations that a slowdown in job growth and wage gains could reduce the pressure on prices and make the Federal Reserve less aggressive in raising interest rates.
The report brought job creation for the year to 4.5 million, pending revisions, as the economy continued to recover from its plunge in 2020. Still, total employment is still millions short of where it was headed before the pandemic, with job losses predicted in the year ahead.
The Biden administration trumpeted the report, calling it evidence that its economic agenda has been working. "For the last two months, we've seen good job growth, we've seen wage rates go up, and we've seen inflation pressures come down," Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh said in an interview. "I think it's a slow and steady approach to bring down inflation and not worry about going into a recession."
Avoiding a recession, of course, is far from guaranteed. That will depend on the Fed's ability to edge interest rates just high enough to contain inflation but not so much that the economy enters a downward spiral -- a balancing act that the Fed itself isn't sure is possible.
The slowdown in hiring in recent months is a sign that the Fed's strategy may finally be constraining the labor market, which remained a standout even as some drivers of economic activity started to sputter. Wage growth eased to 4.6 percent over a year ago, as the frenzy of people reshuffling into new jobs -- and demanding better pay -- has faded.
So far, layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained extremely low, while the gap between the number of available workers and listed jobs is far larger than its historical average.
Nonetheless, the Fed forecasts that the extremely low unemployment rate will rise to about 4.6 percent by the end of this year, as its interest rate increases force companies to retrench. For the Fed's prediction to come true, employers would have to shed well over a million jobs in 2023.
"We're not expecting to see job losses right now, but how do you get to one million jobs fewer over the next year?" asks Christine Cooper, chief U.S. economist at the real estate data firm CoStar. "We're going to have to see some negative numbers."
December's gains were driven by strong hiring in leisure and hospitality, which added 67,000 jobs, and health care, with 55,000. State government employment would have been significantly higher if not for a strike by 48,000 workers at the University of California. Even sectors that had been wobbling, such as retail, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, eked out small increases.
But certain hard-hit industries like hotels and restaurants still haven't regained their prior strength, and have struggled to attract -- and keep -- enough workers to satisfy surging consumer demand. Others that had explosive growth while catering to Covid-era lifestyles are fading fast.
Interest rate increases have directly affected the labor market by taking the air out of the tech sector; the information services category dropped 5,000 jobs in December. That doesn't include the bulk of 18,000 recently announced layoffs at Amazon, or the 8,000 at Salesforce.
Rising borrowing costs have also hamstrung home sales, resulting in sharp cuts at mortgage brokerages. But in an example of how backlogged demand is still powering even industries sensitive to interest rates, construction employers have continued to add jobs at a solid pace.
That could change soon, as order books stabilize. Erica Goodnight runs a lumber supplier in Harmony, N.C., that serves people building backyard sheds, barns and other outbuildings. The company did brisk business as homeowners added more space during the pandemic, but this year Ms. Goodnight is sitting tight on hiring.
"We've found a sweet spot," Ms. Goodnight said. "I don't necessarily foresee any openings. And honestly I think a lot of companies, if the employee will stay and show up for work, they're not removing positions, because they got burned when they laid off employees in the beginning stages of Covid, and those folks didn't come back."
That steady easing is also evident in the number of hours the average worker puts in each week, a figure that has been falling for months and is now on the lower end of its prepandemic range.
Fed officials watch wage increases closely, concerned that they will continue to propel inflation as spending shifts from goods to services, where salaries largely drive prices. The cooler number in December may provide some reassurance that they can continue the path of stepping down interest rate increases that the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, communicated last month as inflation also subsided.
"That sort of orderly progression suggests that the economy is moving in ways that we will start to see that imbalance disappear," Raphael Bostic, a Fed governor, said at a conference of economists in New Orleans on Friday, while cautioning that he expected rates to remain high throughout 2023.
Over the past year, the darkest shadow over the labor market has been the glacial recovery in the share of people either working or looking for work, which remains about a percentage point lower than its level in February 2020. The rebound may be speeding up, as household savings accumulated during the pandemic have dwindled and fast inflation has pushed Americans to take on extra work.
Marshall Chandler would like to stop working, at 69, but his shrunken 401(k) account won't let him. For the past three years, he has been selling high-end Swiss watches at Breguet on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where he says his age is more of an asset than a handicap.
"I would not object to being retired now, but it's just not realistic for me," Mr. Chandler said. "If the market restrengthens and my health continues to be good, I hope to be able to retire in four to five years."
The labor force participation rate ticked up slightly to 62.3 percent in December, as more than 400,000 people entered the labor force, most of them women.
That's something Rebecca Rogers Tijerino, the president of Spherion Staffing and Recruiting, has noticed. More applicants have come through her company's doors over the past quarter, allowing her to fill open listings more quickly.
Along with rising costs, headlines about a looming recession can also drive people to look for more solid positions. "We've seen people proactively concerned about the 'R' word," Ms. Tijerino said. "If they're not on firm ground with their current employer, they're looking to make a change."
The number of people employed by temporary help services -- which historically dips as employers try to shed labor while keeping their permanent employees in an uncertain economic environment -- dropped by 35,000, and is down 111,000 jobs since July.
Workers are not the only ones worried about a recession. Measures of corporate sentiment, like a recent survey of chief financial officers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, are at a low ebb, boding ill for employment gains in the coming year. The Institute for Supply Management found that manufacturing contracted for the second straight month in December, indicating that more companies see business worsening rather than getting better.
That's why experts, while encouraged by the latest numbers, caution against declaring a premature happy ending to the pandemic recovery story.
"We're reading that book, and it's getting really good, but we're not done," said Kathryn Edwards, an adjunct economist at the RAND Corporation. "I would hate for the interpretation of this jobs report to be, 'We did it."'

Full text: That downturn in streaming content that you've been hearing about? Not here yet.
There is a sea change coming to your TV screens, as shifting economics in the television and streaming video industries lead to a sudden decrease in the number of series competing for your limited attention and dollars. (Hold your applause.)
But not yet! This winter, the flood continues. The volume of notable shows is such that I didn't find room in this preview to list new seasons of series I enjoy like "Servant" (Apple TV+, Jan. 13), "Godfather of Harlem" (MGM+, Jan. 15), "Miracle Workers" (TBS, Jan. 16), "You" (Netflix, Feb. 9), "Star Trek: Picard" (Paramount+, Feb. 16) and "The Mandalorian" (Disney+, March 1). Here are the 24 new and returning shows that caught my eye, in chronological order; as always, dates are subject to change.
'Trigun Stampede'
The 1998 outer-space western "Trigun," which occasionally pops up on all-time-best anime lists, is reimagined by Orange, the studio behind the popular "Beastars" series on Netflix. The frenetic, peace-loving hero Vash of the desert planet No Man's Land returns along with his frenemy Meryl Stryfe, who's now a cub reporter. (Crunchyroll, Saturday. Another highly anticipated anime premiere: Season 2 of "Vinland Saga," Monday on Crunchyroll and Netflix.)
'Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches'
Wasting no time after the October premiere of "Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire," AMC offers a second series based on Rice's supernatural tales. Alexandra Daddario plays a neurosurgeon unaware of her roots in New Orleans magic and debauchery. (AMC, Sunday)
'Detectorists'
Talk about a holiday gift: Five years after it ended its run, we get a bonus episode of Mackenzie Crook's melancholy comedy about friendship, disappointment, stubborn pride and the solace of walking around large empty fields wielding metal detectors. The 75-minute one-off catches up with Andy (Crook), Lance (the great Toby Jones) and the other members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, a small world where the stakes can get very high. (Acorn TV, Monday)
'Velma'
The non-canine protagonists of "Scooby-Doo" are reimagined in a highly self-referential prequel series centered on the brainy Velma Dinkley, voiced by Mindy Kaling. (HBO Max, Thursday)
'The Last of Us'
The conversation around this series from Craig Mazin ("Chernobyl") and the video game developer Neil Druckmann is about proving whether a really good live-action show can be made from a video game. (Apparently "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?" didn't count.) Another question, of course, is how badly we need another series set after a zombie apocalypse. Pedro Pascal of "The Mandalorian" and Bella Ramsey of "Game of Thrones" star. (HBO, Jan. 15)
'Stonehouse'
What is it with British men and their painfully ill-fated attempts to fake their own deaths? Last year gave us "The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe" with Eddie Marsan as an angry prole who chose to paddle away from society. Now we have another estimable British actor, Matthew Macfadyen, as John Stonehouse, a member of Parliament who -- honey-trapped by the Czech secret service and an epic failure as a businessman -- assumed the identity of a dead constituent and absconded to Australia. (BritBox, Jan. 17)
'Zora Neale Hurston: Claiming a Space'
"American Experience" profiles a towering figure in 20th-century American literature and social science, in a documentary by Tracy Heather Strain ("Lorraine Hansberry: Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart"). (PBS, Jan. 17)
'Night Court' and 'That '90s Show'
These revivals will be greeted with much good will, though what they might need is liniment. John Larroquette returns at 75 in "Night Court," with Melissa Rauch as the judge, who is the daughter of Harry Anderson's character from the original. Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith, 71 and 79, return in "That '90s Show" as the grandparents of the lead, a teenager played by Callie Haverda who's the daughter of the characters played by Laura Prepon and Topher Grace in "That '70s Show." (NBC, Jan. 17; Netflix, Jan. 19)
'Fauda'
The fourth season of the Israeli shoot-em-up thriller, which was shown in Israel this past summer, comes to the rest of the world. Wildly popular in some quarters for its orchestration of tension and mayhem, and condemned in others for its portrayal of Palestinians in the occupied territories, the show shifts much of its action in the new season to Brussels's Muslim district. (Netflix, Jan. 20)
'Extraordinary'
In her first series, the Northern Irish writer Emma Moran upends the superhero equation: Everyone has a power except her young heroine, Jen (Máiréad Tyers). Jen's angst is the focus, but the comic backdrop is the radical democratization of special abilities. Flight? A good way to escape an awkward date. Contacting the dead? Useful in probate court. (Hulu, Jan. 25)
'The 1619 Project'
The New York Times Magazine's examination of the centrality of slavery in American history has been adapted into a six-part documentary; Nikole Hannah-Jones, who won a 2020 Pulitzer Prize for the project, is the host. (The Times is a producer of the series.) (Hulu, Jan. 26)
'Poker Face'
Natasha Lyonne plays a roving do-gooder with a possibly supernatural ability to tell when people are lying in this retro crime-caper-drama-comedy-whatsit created by Rian Johnson of the "Knives Out" movies. The show is being compared, in advance, to "Columbo"; "Route 66" may also come to mind, and the first episode includes prominent nods to "Pulp Fiction" and "Burn Notice." (Peacock, Jan. 26)
'Wolf Pack'
Jeff Davis has had a TV career whose output is in inverse proportion to its success: He's been responsible for just two shows, the grisly CBS cash cow "Criminal Minds" and the stylish MTV supernatural drama "Teen Wolf." Both had intensely devoted followings, which probably barely overlapped. For his third series, he returns to teenage werewolves in California, in a young-skewing drama with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rodrigo Santoro as the responsible adults. "Wolf Pack" is not connected to "Teen Wolf," which is likely to cause endless confusion, especially because Paramount+ is debuting the new series and Davis's "Teen Wolf: The Movie" on the same night. (Paramount+, Jan. 26.)
'The Upshaws'
In the wide Sargasso Sea of traditional family sitcoms, "The Upshaws," returning for its third season, is one of the funnier and more touching landfalls. Wanda Sykes, Mike Epps and Kim Fields play the putative authority figures in a fractious Indianapolis clan with an understated polish that doesn't slide over into the usual slickness. (Netflix, Feb. 16)
'Hello Tomorrow!'
Billy Crudup, Hank Azaria, Haneefah Wood and Dewshane Williams star as a crew selling timeshares on the moon -- "Glengarry Glen Ross" through a Ray Bradbury lens. This satirical sci-fi fantasy created by Amit Bhalla and Lucas Jansen ("Bloodline") is set in a retro-styled suburban future maintained by ungainly, hovering robots. (Apple TV+, Feb. 17)
'The Company You Keep'
Milo Ventimiglia segues from glossy soap opera in "This Is Us" to glossy crime drama, playing a high-class con man who hooks up with a C.I.A. agent (Catherine Haena Kim). One of the showrunners, Phil Klemmer, has a track record with shows that veer from the network norm: "Legends of Tomorrow," "Chuck" and "Veronica Mars." (ABC, Feb. 19)
'Snowfall'
This rabidly entertaining series, originally positioned as an exposé of government involvement in the crack-cocaine epidemic, has grown into a dark, operatic family drama. Its sixth and final season opens with Franklin (Damson Idris) pitted against his Aunt Louie (Angela Lewis) and Uncle Jerome (Amin Joseph) for survival in the South Central drug trade. (FX, Feb. 22)
'The Consultant'
Tony Basgallop, the creator of "Servant" on Apple TV+, goes creepy-comic again in this tech thriller set at a gaming company with a new boss (Christoph Waltz) whose management style redefines predatory capitalism. Brittany O'Grady from the first season of "The White Lotus" plays a personal assistant who's trying to figure out what he's up to. (Amazon, Feb. 24)
'Party Down'
The reboots of "Night Court" and "That '70s Show" are largely populated by new actors, but this critics' darling from 2009-10 is bringing back most of its cast for a third season that feels continuous despite the 13-year gap. Adam Scott, Ken Marino, Jane Lynch, Ryan Hansen, Megan Mullally and Martin Starr return; most of the characters no longer moonlight with the Hollywood catering company Party Down (at least at first), but they can't escape its orbit. (Starz, Feb. 24)
'Perry Mason'
Season 1 went through a strenuous, not entirely successful effort to complicate and darken the character from Erle Stanley Gardner's pulp novels; Mason was introduced as a cynical, alcoholic private eye before beginning to morph into the shrewd lawyer Gardner created. The 1930s Hollywood-noir atmosphere and Matthew Rhys's presence as Mason, though, argue for giving the second season a chance. (HBO, March 6)
'Shadow & Bone'
As dark (but not too dark) young-adult fantasy adventures go, this series, set in a martial world that blends elements of imperial Russia and Victorian England, is more than tolerable. The British actress Jessie Mei Li is appealing as the heroine, a cartographer who learns she has magical ability on an epic scale, which she is still trying to control in Season 2. (Netflix, March 16)
'Mrs. Davis'
Betty Gilpin of "Glow" joins forces with the writer and producer Damon Lindelof of "Watchmen," playing a nun doing battle with an omniscient artificial intelligence in a thriller written by Lindelof and Tara Hernandez ("The Big Bang Theory"). The nun is Simone; the A.I. is Mrs. Davis. (Peacock, April 20)
'Tom Jones'
Gwyneth Hughes, who has already adapted "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and "Vanity Fair" for TV, takes on Henry Fielding's galloping, randy satire of 18th-century English values. A pair of newcomers star in the four-part series: Solly McLeod as the foundling Tom, and Sophie Wilde as his true love, Sophia, who's now an Anglo-Caribbean immigrant. (PBS, April 30)

Bankruptcy Is Possible, Retailer Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The home goods retailer said weak sales and slower foot traffic had forced it to consider options for restructuring.
Bed Bath & Beyond, the beleaguered home goods retailer, warned investors on Thursday about rapidly darkening prospects for its future, saying that bankruptcy was a possible option and raising doubts that it could pull off an ambitious turnaround plan it put in place just months ago.
The company could make a decision on its next steps -- including whether to file for bankruptcy -- within weeks, though it is possible the process will take longer, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process is confidential.
Bed Bath & Beyond, known to many shoppers for its distinctive and seemingly inescapable blue and white coupons, has struggled for years to compete with the likes of Amazon, as more shoppers have gone online for everyday home products.
The retailer laid out a plan in August to turn itself around that included 150 store closings, cost cuts and layoffs. But it needs cash to execute those plans, and it is not clear that the crucial holiday shopping season brought in enough for it to continue without help from outside investors.
"The company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Bed Bath & Beyond said in a statement.
Sue Gove, who became the retailer's permanent chief executive in October, has been focused on working through a restructuring plan to improve the company's ailing supply chain and better stock its stores. But its suppliers remain unconvinced, and it said in a regulatory filing that it was at risk of running out of cash in the coming months.
"Before Christmas, there was just a glimmer of hope," said Neil Saunders, managing director at the retail consulting firm GlobalData. "There was a view that, OK, it's going to be difficult, but maybe they were going to pull through. Things have just got worse."
He added, "They sent out a very clear signal today that they've just run out of time."
Bed Bath & Beyond employed about 32,000 workers as of February and said in October that it had closed about half the stores it planned to as part of its restructuring.
The company, which now has roughly 900 stores across the country, reported preliminary earnings Thursday, noting lower sales and slower foot traffic compared with the previous year. The company said its sales were about $ 1.3 billion for the quarter that ended Nov. 26, about a third lower than the year before, when it had more stores. The period included the run-up to Black Friday.
The retailer estimated that it would record a loss of $ 386 million in its latest quarter, much worse than the $ 276 million loss in the previous year, and said it would need more time than expected to close its books. As of March, Bed Bath & Beyond had roughly $ 3 billion in debt.
The company's share price closed nearly 30 percent lower on Thursday, giving it a market capitalization of $ 150 million. At its peak in 2013, the company's market value was $ 17 billion.
In addition to a possible bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is exploring a number of options to shore up its balance sheet, including selling pieces or all of the company. To help with those efforts, it is working with advisers at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, the consulting firm Alix Partners and the investment bank Lazard, the two people familiar with the matter said. Alix Partners and Lazard declined to comment. A spokesman for Kirkland did not respond to a request for comment.
"No determinations have been made as of this time," Julie Strider, a Bed Bath & Beyond spokeswoman, said in a statement regarding the retailer's next steps.
Its ability to obtain cash through those means will determine whether it needs to file for bankruptcy.
Bed Bath & Beyond plans to give an update on Tuesday about its efforts to raise cash.
A bankruptcy filing would give Bed Bath & Beyond the chance to shed debt and stores and emerge as a leaner, stronger company, as Neiman Marcus was able to after filing for bankruptcy in 2020. But if performance deteriorates, or its suppliers decide they will not offer their support, Bed Bath & Beyond could be forced to close, like Toys "R" Us.
"What we've seen many times is that it ends up being a stay of execution," Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson, said. "Sometimes that works, but oftentimes you see an announcement of scaling back and having fewer stores and then that's followed by a complete liquidation."
The attempted turnaround announced in August is being led by Ms. Gove, who at that time was interim C.E.O. after the abrupt departure of the previous chief executive, Mark Tritton, in June.
But transforming a company under the burden of debt payments and the glare of suppliers that have lost their faith can be tricky. Investing in supply chains and merchandising requires money -- and patience.
"Transforming an organization of our size and scale requires time," Ms. Gove said. "We anticipate that each coming quarter will build on our progress."
Ms. Gove said she had spoken to suppliers directly in an attempt to instill confidence. But they have continued to hold back, resulting in lower levels of in-stock items. Supply chain challenges made more severe by China's tough Covid strategy have made suppliers particularly picky about the retailers they sell their product to.
Bed Bath & Beyond has also been trying to win back the support of investors, who have watched as a series of activist investors, including the meme stock favorite Ryan Cohen, have pushed for changes on its board and for the company to consider selling its Buy Buy Baby brand. Mr. Cohen sold his stake in the company in August, pushing its shares down 40 percent.
It has had to grapple with other turmoil. In September, its chief financial officer, Gustavo Arnal, died in what was ruled a suicide. Laura Crossen, the retailer's chief accounting officer, has since been serving as interim financial chief.
Despite Bed Bath & Beyond's bespoke challenges, its debt worries resonate with the broader retail industry. Inflation, rising interest rates and continued supply chain challenges are probably setting up retailers up for a challenging 2023. Consumers were willing to spend this holiday season, with U.S. retail sales up 7.6 percent from the previous period of Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to Mastercard Spending Pulse. But how much longer that trend will last is unclear, if the economy tips into a recession, as a number of economists have forecast.
And those who may look to the debt market for reprieve will probably find lenders less eager than they have been in the past two years, when interest rates hovered near zero. Lenders that were previously willing to put money into riskier companies like Bed Bath & Beyond may no longer be willing to take that bet. Supply chain issues worldwide mean companies have less product, not only to sell to customers but to offer lenders as collateral.
For a company in as much financial trouble as Bed Bath & Beyond, "it's very difficult to raise new capital, but it's also difficult to get your current capital providers to want to play ball for a longer period of time," said James Gellert, the chief executive of the financial analytic firm RapidRatings International.
That makes it "really hard for a company like them to claw out of the position that they're currently in."

Resolutions That Are Good for the Soul: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I never know how to think about New Year's resolutions or whether to make them. On one hand, I am drawn to the idea of new beginnings. I love the intentionality and thoughtfulness that are required to make a resolution. They force me to reflect on what I long for, what the good life might consist of and how to get there, which is a good exercise for all of us at any time.
On the other hand, I am lousy at discipline. So resolutions, to me, can feel ungracious, a yearly visit from a disgruntled drill sergeant, an occasion for needless guilt. This ambivalence springs from a tension I feel between the responsibility to actively seek self-improvement and the reality that, in the end, everything most lovely in life -- from love to salvation to goodness to joy -- comes as a gift. It is all a mercy. Even our ability to strive toward change is a gift, a grace and not exactly in our control, which is clear to anyone who has ever planned a productive day only to be sidelined by a head cold, a migraine or a broken transmission.
The point of resolutions shouldn't be to add another task to our busy lives or another brick on the crushing and cruel burden to "do better." The point is that renewal is always possible, and with a large dollop of grace we can freely try new things; we can continue to grow and change. Last year I asked writers, scholars and spiritual leaders to suggest resolutions that weren't focused on sculpting a beach body or maximizing one's earning capacity but were instead practical ways to nourish one's soul or the "soul" of our society. I heard back from many readers who found delight in trying one or two (or more) of these suggestions, so we're back again for the second annual "reSOULutions," this time for 2023.
Begin the day reading about faith.
I'm the early bird of my household. Most days, I'm up before first light. So why do I spend that first precious hour doomscrolling in bed? Even after I get up, brush my teeth and pray, I too often return to things that make me mad on my screen. During Ramadan, I do things differently. I get out of bed immediately after waking, say my prayers, set my intention for the day and then open a physical book about faith (most often about Islam, but not always). I find it so elevating. One purpose of time-bound religious rituals like Ramadan and Lent is to help us reflect upon, and improve, our regular routines. I'm going to use New Year's to try to bring the practice of beginning the day with a physical book about faith into my everyday life.
-- Eboo Patel, founder and president of Interfaith America
Narrow your news focus.
As a journalist, I encounter many subjects on which I'm rarely, if ever, willing to comment. It's not that I think they're unimportant. On the contrary, I think they're too important for me to speak from ignorance, and I know I don't have the background knowledge to give these topics their due.
As a news consumer, consider a similar practice: Resolve to know just a few stories and to know them well. Your time and attention are limited. You can't do justice to every issue of the day, and maintaining a broad, shallow pattern of news consumption makes you vulnerable to manipulation and confusion. So this year, pick at most half a dozen big stories to follow carefully and in depth. Read books, not just the latest headlines. Learn key names and legislation. Find trustworthy journalists to keep you up-to-date. Then remember your finitude and ignore everything else.
-- Bonnie Kristian, journalist and author of "Untrustworthy" and "A Flexible Faith"
Create silence.
The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard has some great wisdom for our age: "Create silence! The Word of God cannot be heard in the noisy world of today." We need to create silence by spending less time with our screens and being more mindful of the people around us. We need to learn to be still and bask in the gift of the presence of God and our neighbors.
If we don't create silence, then we may find ourselves engaging in noisy monologues. This is certainly a path to a divisive and violent cacophony. God created us as reflections of his Word to be part of a harmonious symphony.
-- Roland Millare, theologian at the St. John Paul II Foundation and author of "A Living Sacrifice"
Write one letter every week.
In a world where a majority of communication is done through a device, the act of writing and receiving a letter has become even more precious. I will write one letter a week to someone I love or cherish, and I will happily imagine the recipients' delight to find a handwritten note in the midst of their daily bills and mailers.
-- Karina Yan Glaser, children's book author and illustrator
Confront your sorrow.
I love how "courage" derives from the Latin word for "heart." In the coming year, I want to courageously acknowledge specific ways in which my heart has been broken -- by people, by racism, by institutions and even by God -- so that I can pursue the healing I need. If we want to be agents of healing to our hurting world, we must courageously and continuously pursue the healing of our own hearts.
-- Rev. Michelle T. Sanchez, author of "Color-Courageous Discipleship" and "God's Beloved Community"
Forget balance and embrace grace.
Every year I strive to achieve the ever-elusive work-life balance, only to reach a place of imbalance. Then disappointment, frustration, uncertainty, anxiety, irritability -- or any combination of these -- set in. This year, instead of feeling that I'm neglecting family during times of work, neglecting work during time with family or friends or feeling guilty about a lack of productivity during times of relaxation or reflection, I'll embrace each moment and more deliberately invite grace into my life.
Instead of wallowing in perceived failures, we can pause (even for a couple of minutes) to engage in focused breathing, meditation, prayer or expressions of gratitude. Doing so will benefit our brain health and emotional wellness. Balance is a false construct of a task-based world. Grace allows every one of us to invite peace and harmony into our soul.
-- Nii Addy, neuroscientist, associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University and host of the "Addy Hour" podcast
Gather, feast and rest with others.
I've practiced Sabbath keeping weekly with my family for nearly 15 years. Having a regular rhythm to stop, rest, delight and contemplate has been soul-forming. Over the past two years, however, I've discovered a deepening need to gather with others more intentionally on this day for unhurried conversation, good drink and play. The word "gather" will be a significant word for me. After a pandemic season of being scattered, my wife and I will create spaces for others to belong. Feasting is not something that should be highlighted in our lives a handful of times a year -- most notably during the holidays. Feasting needs to be a regular spiritual practice of savoring the gifts of God in the form of people and food, and creative spaces for connection.
-- Rich Villodas, pastor and author of "Good and Beautiful and Kind"
Practice nonviolence, even internally.
My resolution is to practice nonviolence in my head and heart. Every morning, after praying, I read the paper and find myself hating on Vladimir Putin and the Russians for the enormous and unprovoked suffering they have unleashed on Ukraine. I can't do much to stop that war, but I can stop the war in my head and stop the hate in my heart. Nonviolence begins with converting myself.
-- Bill Cavanaugh, theologian at DePaul University
Think small.
As somebody who reflects on ethical failure for a living, I have realized how often I get overwhelmed with big problems in our world or my own life, and then assume I need to find an equally big solution right away. This year, I am going to try to take to heart the advice Pope Francis gave to focus first on the small moments of peaceful encounter with the good and with God in our everyday lives. Often it is these small moments of grace which "transmit the joy of living and suggest further good initiatives."
-- Elisabeth Rain Kincaid, Legendre-Soulé chair of business ethics and director of the Center for Ethics and Economic Justice at Loyola University New Orleans
Seek the wisdom of elders.
Everyone I know has an area of their life they are unsure what to do with. Our physical health, financial well-being, relational confusion. We do our best, but honestly, we are a mess. We may turn to Google, TikTok or Amazon for a solution, but we still feel stuck and confused. Before all of these mediated places of advice, we used to go to village elders and ask for wisdom. They were the people who knew our lives and our family histories. They could see our individual strengths and weaknesses. From this vantage point they could offer nuanced and practical advice -- ancient wisdom that was able to be applied specifically to our circumstances. We need this again. We need eye-to-eye, knee-to-knee, heart-to-heart advice -- counsel that comes from wisdom but is offered from flesh-and-blood people who will see it through with us. Pastors, parents and grandparents can watch our progress and celebrate, as well as challenge us. This requires getting up close to people and being vulnerable. But isn't that what we all really need?
-- Jay Pathak, national director for Vineyard U.S.A., a network of churches
Thank you, friends, for your wisdom, thoughtfulness and inspiration! Again this year, I think I'll start small and pick one or two of these that feel challenging and hopeful to me. All of them require some effort and more than a little grace.

As Google Cuts Costs, Employees Are Fretting: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant has so far taken steps to streamline without mass layoffs, but employees are girding for deeper cuts.
Google workers in Switzerland sent a letter this month to the company's vice president of human resources, outlining their worries that a new employee evaluation system could be used to cull the work force.
"The number and spread of reports that reached us indicates that at least some managers were aggressively pressured to apply a quota" on a process that could lead to employees getting negative ratings and potentially losing their jobs, five workers and employee representatives wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The letter signaled how some Google employees are increasingly interpreting recent management decisions as warnings that the company may be angling to conduct broader layoffs. From the impending closure of a small office and the cancellation of a content-moderation project to various efforts to ease budgets during 2023 planning meetings, the Silicon Valley behemoth has become a tinderbox of anxiety, according to interviews with 14 current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
In some cases, Google employees have reacted to a program that the company began in July to simplify operations, cut red tape and make itself more productive. In other instances, they have had budget conversations, with some teams unable to hire more next year, the people said. And workers have also fretted over decisions made months ago that, to some, have taken on new meaning, they said.
The worries have grown as Google's tech industry peers have handed out pink slips amid a souring global economy. Last month, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, purged its ranks by 11,000, or about 13 percent of its work force. Amazon also began laying off about 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs, or about 3 percent of its corporate employees.
Even Google, which is on track to make tens of billions of dollars in profits this year, has had to come to terms with a slowdown. In October, as the digital advertising market slumped, Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported that profit dropped 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $ 13.9 billion.
Google did not comment on employee anxiety in a response to a request from The Times. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said in October that the company would "focus on a clear set of product and business priorities." He also said it would slow hiring and "moderate" the growth of its expenses.
Unlike other big tech companies, Google has so far avoided large-scale job cuts. Still, investors have pushed the company to become more aggressive about "defending" its huge profits, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI.
"One of the most obvious ways to do that is to cut costs and reduce your employee head count," he said. He added that it was "kind of odd" that Google's parent had hired 30,000 employees in the last three quarters, given the economic trends. At the end of September, Alphabet had 186,779 workers.
In recent months, Google has appeared to pay more attention to costs. In July, it started the program to streamline operations. Soon after, it canceled some projects, including the Pixelbook laptop and Stadia, its streaming platform for video games. It has also reduced funding for Area 120, an in-house product incubator.
At one recent meeting, a Google human resources representative told a worker that the company would revisit the possibility of broader layoffs in the new year, and that it was a decision for Mr. Pichai, according to an audio recording obtained by The Times.
Google has told other employees that it would put a priority on trimming real estate expenditures, travel costs and perks before it pursued layoffs, said a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The company plans to close a small office in Farmington Hills, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, next month.
Project cancellations and reorganizations have stoked nervousness. In September, Google's YouTube shut down a project based in the Farmington Hills office with nearly 80 workers, laying off some staff members who did not find new roles at the company, four people familiar with the decision said. YouTube had hired them as contract workers to moderate content on the video platform. Google said 14 workers had lost their jobs.
Google said that through these types of reorganizations, it was not looking to reduce the size of its overall work force, but that some teams might eliminate roles as the company reassessed its priorities.
Some teams that consistently grew in the past will be unable to hire more people next year, four people familiar with the situation said. There are also higher demands for 2023 planning, such as a manager's being asked to draft plans on how to handle 10 different budget scenarios instead of three or four, one person said. In planning discussions, leaders have pressed managers to justify their expenses, asking if there are workarounds or team reorganizations that could save money, two people said.
One of the biggest concerns for some employees has been whether Google could use its new performance-evaluation system to accelerate job cuts. In May, the company installed the new system, called Googler Reviews and Development.
Under the system, managers expect the bottom 2 percent of employees to be categorized as having "not enough impact," according to two people familiar with the matter. Another 4 percent should be judged as providing "moderate impact."
Concerns have intensified that the bottom 6 percent, or roughly 11,000 people, could be targeted for dismissal, according to four people, and as earlier reported by the tech news site The Information.
The GRAD system means Google now has two categories for employees who are considered low performing, compared with one under the old program, potentially leading to a bigger pool of workers at the bottom. The system has also had a bumpy rollout, with managers and employees confused about how it should work, according to the letter and four employees.
Google said it expected workers would become more comfortable with the system over time. It added that it had a no-surprises policy, meaning employees would know well in advance if their performance was falling short.
Before handing out the two lowest ratings, managers are also supposed to notify employees in "support check-in" meetings. Google said not every such meeting would lead to a lower rating, with support check-ins also held for those who need extra help to meet their obligations.
Employees would also have indications if their manager wanted to put them on a "performance improvement" plan, the company said, a process that compels workers to improve their work within 60 days to keep their jobs. Google has given workers the choice of staying on a performance-improvement plan or resigning with a buyout package.
Google said that it had not made changes to increase the number of performance plans, and that it had offered these types of severance options for years.
This month's letter from some of Google's workers in Switzerland to Fiona Cicconi, the vice president of human resources, was led by members of a 15-person employee representation committee, ER-CH.
One of their primary concerns was that contrary to what some Google executives have said, the company may have a quota for the number of employees who were supposed to have support check-ins, and whose jobs might therefore be vulnerable.
Google said it had not imposed a quota on support check-ins. But when almost no one used these meetings after the GRAD system was put in place, it said, it asked leaders to convey the importance of the meetings to managers.
The memo signatories in Switzerland also said there was confusion, among managers and workers alike, about who qualified for a support check-in. They urged Ms. Cicconi to put guardrails in place so that the system did not lead to mass firings.
"It's normal that new processes don't run smoothly in the beginning, but this should not happen at the expense of Googlers' well-being, careers and compensation," they wrote.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Best Costume Party The cast members of the Broadway revival of "1776," about two dozen strong (right), arrive in rehearsal room wear -- sneakers, T-shirts, leggings. And then, at some signal, they simultaneously kick off their shoes, pull up their socks and slip on an outer layer, suddenly assuming the breeches and frock coat chic of the members of the Continental Congress. As directed by Diane Paulus and Jeffrey L. Page, this preshow routine performs a kind of magic trick. These actors have everything up their sleeves. Now you see them. This opening moment is also a provocation. What, it asks, would America look like now if these bodies -- female, nonbinary, Indigenous, of color -- had birthed it? ALEXIS SOLOSKI
Resolute Until the End Why seek out another revival of Edward Albee's "Three Tall Women" when we had a revelatory one, starring Glenda Jackson, so recently? For one thing, the play, a kind of Cubist portrait of a woman's life, rewards repeat encounters from different angles. But the big news in this 2021 Stratford Festival production, which began streaming this October on Stratfest@Home (and will remain available through Oct. 16, 2023), is the performance of Martha Henry, one of Canada's greatest classical actors, as the dying woman at its center. A softer take than Jackson's -- anyone's would be -- it is nevertheless diamond-hard in its acceptance of fate. Indeed, 12 days after the stage run ended, Henry died, at age 83. In every moment you feel her intention to leave the world uncompromised, her nerve and wit blazing. JESSE GREEN
Pandemic as Backdrop Robert O'Hara's update of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" made shrewd sense of the Tyrone family's implosion: Lockdown! On a Minetta Lane Theater stage strewn with hand sanitizer, discarded masks and half-opened Amazon delivery boxes, Elizabeth Marvel, as Mary, fell apart grandly, while Bill Camp offered a wickedly funny James Tyrone -- selfabsorbed, self-flagellating, but more than anything, colossally bored. SCOTT HELLER
A Punishing Few Seconds One of the most suspenseful scenes of the year lasts only a few seconds, but they feel like a punishing eternity. In the Broadway production of Martyna Majok's "Cost of Living," Ani, a quadriplegic double amputee played by Katy Sullivan (right, with David Zayas), is relaxing in a bath. When her estranged husband-turned-caregiver walks away to another room, Ani, left alone, loses her bearings in the tub. She can't get enough purchase to lift herself out and remains submerged, slowly drowning. Rarely has vulnerability been so depicted so economically and so heartbreakingly. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Flaw-Filled Finale A dark comedy about a dark childhood, "The Bedwetter," Sarah Silverman's autobiographical musical at the Atlantic Theater Company with songs by Adam Schlesinger, spends two acts detailing Sarah's bleak tweendom: lothario dad, depressed mom, dead shrink, pill habit, all floating on an ocean of urinary incontinence. In the closing number, Sarah (Zoe Glick, right) finally owns her imperfections. Her family and friends join her onstage to own theirs, too, singing, "Everybody's got a story/Every story should be told/The shame you carry like a ton of bricks is really worth its weight in gold." If not exactly a happy ending, it's a generous admission that we're all flawed and that it's those flaws that make us human. Later on, the flaws might even make for a good stand-up set. ALEXIS SOLOSKI
Tragicomic Excellence Bryna Turner's comedy "At the Wedding" already had smart, biting dialogue, but it was Mary Wiseman, playing a hard-drinking smartass named Carlo in the Lincoln Center Theater production, who electrified this show and brought it to a whole new level of tragicomic excellence. Wiseman, as a woman caught in the particular hell that is an ex's wedding, delivered each line with the same kind of quick-draw rapier wit and erosive sense of self-worth as Natasha Lyonne's character in "Russian Doll." (Like Lyonne, she even has wild red hair.) Wiseman underscored the comic performance with such a pervasive sense of vulnerability that Carlo always came across as real and relatable. MAYA PHILLIPS Bass-Baritone Thrills Word that the cult musical "The Life" would get a run courtesy of City Center's Encores! series led fans to ask: Who would play the magnetic, threatening pimp Memphis, the role that earned Chuck Cooper a 1997 TonyAward for the show's original Broadway production? The sculpted Antwayn Hopper and his otherworldly bass-baritone -- especially in "My Way or the Highway," the character's signature song -- was the thrilling answer. He was the standout in a production that otherwise strained under updating. P.S.: His red carpet action during the awards season campaign for the musical "A Strange Loop," where he played one of those pesky Thoughts, wasn't shabby, either. SCOTT HELLER
An Actor Transformed Corey Hawkins's performance as Lincoln in Suzan-Lori Parks's "Topdog/Underdog" is so transformative that the actor is almost unrecognizable. Hawkins (far left) is aged up, and appears bedraggled, hard-pressed for some good luck. For so much of the finely tuned play, Lincoln is the underdog, and Hawkins gives the character the kind of knowing speeches and glances that one would expect of an older brother who has yet to figure out his own life. Seamlessly shifting from lighthearted banter to a heartbreaking wilt, Hawkins deftly lays the emotional groundwork that leads to the play's big third-act twist. MAYA PHILLIPS Mesmerizing Opener Alone in a single-room-occupancy apartment, a man builds a stage from milk crates and cardboard. He's the designer, the playwright, the director, the star. "Watch me close," the man demands. "Watch me close now." And in the opening moments of Suzan-Lori Parks's brilliant, blistering "Topdog/Underdog," how could a person do anything else? Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (near left) opens the show as Booth, a man teaching himself the three-card monte hustle. His hands falter; his understanding of the swindle is incomplete. But he's an expert at conning himself, and when he rattles off his patter, with such yearning and flair, anyone would fall for his dodge. ALEXIS SOLOSKI
Written in Blood The making of a nation is so rarely a peaceful process. The story of any land is written, in part, in blood. The ecstatic final moments of Tracy Letts's Broadway play "The Minutes," set at a city council meeting in a Midwestern enclave and directed by Anna D. Shapiro, acknowledges America's savage origins. After more than an hour, the parliamentary procedure and discussion of the Big Cherry Heritage Festival gives way to a different kind of rite, a blood ritual literalizing the violent ways in which those in power maintain it. The scene is a travesty, a terrible joke. That's how the conquered must feel about our nation's history, too. ALEXIS SOLOSKI Domesticated Dino The baby dinosaur in Thornton Wilder's play "The Skin of Our Teeth" is a sweetheart, domesticated as a dog. And in Lileana Blain-Cruz's visually extravagant Broadway production at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, he was a puppet so enormous that he counted as one of the show's several spectacles. When he and his mammoth pal -- also a puppet, also designed by James Ortiz -- came in from a ferocious cold snap to warm up in their human family's living room, they were an endearing sight, wreaking benevolent havoc on the houseplants. Then the animals were ordered back outside, into the Ice Age, and the dinosaur gave a backward glance touched with innocence and doom -- a more emotionally immediate argument about climate change than a thousand position papers. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
Human Bulldozer I don't remember the specifics of Sam Rockwell's role in the Broadway revival of "American Buffalo" as much as I remember its atmosphere. Rockwell's performance had an unbridled force: When he stepped onstage as the foul-mouthed Teach visiting a friend's junk shop, he virtually bulldozed his way through the space. Embodying the theatrical show of masculinity that the playwright David Mamet is fascinated with here, Rockwell's Teach moved with violent energy, rapidly pacing while picking things up and putting them down, all the while cursing so freely that the expletives seemed like a new kind of English dialect. MAYA PHILLIPS Team Work as a Lifeline On the Tuesday in early May when I went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see Jamie Lloyd's stunning "Cyrano de Bergerac" for the fourth time, its star, James McAvoy, was off his game. Nothing flagrant, but Cyrano's laughs weren't landing; his usually exquisite poignancy was not in evidence. It's only human to have a bad day at work; happens to all of us. What made the performance so moving, and memorable, was watching the rest of that powerhouse company step up, steadying and buoying McAvoy. Evelyn Miller as Roxane, Michele Austin as Leila, Adam Best as Le Bret -- they were like lifelines in their scenes with Cyrano. I went back to see it once more, by the way, and McAvoy smashed it, left me dazed. They all did. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
Small Miracles On its surface, Samuel D. Hunter's "A Case for the Existence of God" seemed simple, with its two characters seated in one confining office cubicle. But in the deft hands of the director David Cromer, the transitions that showed time passing -- and a friendship tentatively blossoming -- were almost invisibly signaled by the scrolling of a desktop computer screen. The year's most subtle piece of stagecraft. SCOTT HELLER
Award Show Glory The human voice can be a thrill ride. Sometimes it lifts you up and lands you gently in a slightly new place. Other times, though, it grabs you by the neck and carries you far away -- which is the feeling I got when listening to Joaquina Kalukango sing "Let It Burn" at the Tony Awards in June. (She won, of course: best actress in a musical.) I had thrilled to her performance of the song before, at the climax of "Paradise Square." But without the context of that problematic show, the glory was all hers, not the character's, as she held us tight in a melody that just kept rising until you thought it could rise no further. It did. JESSE GREEN
Multiple Personalities By now we know that Phillipa Soo (center right) is a gift to the musical theater. But this year she showed more sides to her talent than ever, including a flair for comedy: as the haughty "warrior queen" Inez Milholland in "Suffs" at the Public Theater; as the starchy Sarah Brown, loosening up under the sway of her real-life husband Steven Pasquale (as Sky Masterson) in "Guys and Dolls" at the Kennedy Center; and as the adorably frantic Cinderella in the Broadway revival of "Into the Woods." I've never heard "On the Steps of the Palace" done better. Coming in 2023: a trip to another palace, as Guinevere in "Camelot." SCOTT HELLER
A Snowy 'Epiphany' It can be difficult to emotionally connect to a play whose main currency is ideas. And yet when I think back to Brian Watkins's "Epiphany" at Lincoln Center Theater, what I remember best aren't the heady concepts but my emotional reaction to the final scene in the play, also an adaptation of James Joyce's "The Dead." Joyce's beloved short story ends with an elegant description of snowfall that subtly expands into a vast existential statement. In "Epiphany," the snowstorm we saw raging outside the windows of John Lee Beatty's exquisite imagining of a luxe, antique home eventually comes inside. Snow falling inside a living room as the hours creep onward? Ethereal. MAYA PHILLIPS Red, White and Blue The outdoor Independence Day revue masterminded by the director Tina Landau on Little Island delivered two particularly glorious moments, both from Judy Kuhn. The first was "Dear Theodosia," from "Hamilton," where the singer achieved aching intimacy against a setting of boats crisscrossing the Hudson at dusk. But the coup de grâce was a cover of Laura Nyro's "Save the Country," which ended with the quietly seething lines "We could build the dream with love/And I got fury in my soul/Fury's gonna take me to the glory goal" -- a mix of anger and hope that should be familiar to many Americans. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Grounded Naturalism Kara Young doesn't do any role by halves, and as Viola this past summer in the Classical Theater of Harlem's "Twelfth Night," she was breathtaking instantly. Fresh from her Tony Award nomination for Lynn Nottage's "Clyde's," she stepped into Shakespeare with an extraordinarily grounded naturalism. Shipwrecked at play's start, Viola arrives on the shore of Illyria convinced that her brother, Sebastian, has died at sea. It's a setup often treated as a simple plot device, with no depth of feeling to underpin it. But in Carl Cofield's production, Young entered bereft and shivering. That brief, understated glimpse of anguish was all we needed to believe in the siblings' bond -- and get a little choked up when, this being a comedy, they were reunited at the end. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Ambitious Staging The Belgian collective FC Bergman's show "300 el x 50 el x 30 el" was incredibly intricate: A camera on a circular rail tracked what happened inside each dwelling of a small village that had been painstakingly built on the stage of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater. The pinnacle was the ending, when the entire company jumped up and down in unison for what felt like forever. The more it went on, the more exhilarating it was. I still can't quite figure out why this happened, but maybe it's that gratuitousness that makes the staging memorable. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Refugee Puppet On the plaza at Lincoln Center, the 12-foot-tall Little Amal puppet swayed gently to the music as an ensemble serenaded her from a balcony. In front of the closed gates of an amusement-park ride in Coney Island, Brooklyn, she danced wistfully to the wafting notes of a Gershwin tune. At the head of a joyous procession up Central Park West, she bounced with sweet abandon to the brass band trailing after her. Created by Handspring Puppet Company, Amal is a 10-year-old Syrian refugee -- a bit hulking for a child, and with her long legs capable of striding at quite a clip. But on her tour of New York as summer turned to fall, grace found her whenever she danced. Free in her body, she was sublime. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
Sticking the Landing If you saw her as the Barbra Streisand-obsessed Rachel Berry on "Glee," you wouldn't really question that Lea Michele could sing the role of Fanny Brice in "Funny Girl," the 1964 Streisand vehicle. She sang it constantly, and well. You might have wondered, though, what else she could do with her fabulous instrument; the role is not a cantata but an emotional slalom that had ended in wipeouts for many before her. When Michele took over the role in the Broadway revival in September, following Beanie Feldstein, she immediately made it clear that she'd learned enough since her Rachel days about the purposes of singing (and the backlashes of life) to give the role surprising dimension. She didn't just belt, she had been belted, and let us hear it. JESSE GREEN No-Holds-Barred Hamlet Lars Eidinger's performance in "Hamlet" at BAM was so inventively bonkers that it felt like a highlight reel. My favorite moment looked unscripted -- the German actor is known to fly off on improvised limbs -- but actually wasn't. Without warning, Eidinger let himself fall forward, without any attempt to break the move, and did a faceplant into a mound of moist dirt. Then he just laid there. The move fully committed to elemental slapstick and yet it also carried all the sadness and powerlessness in the world: What else could Hamlet do? ELISABETH VINCENTELLI

Hope Beckoned in Harlem, but a Cruel Twist Awaited: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Harlem building beckoned a group of families desperate for a home, only to serve them another cruel twist.
Dwayne Seifforth spent years struggling with homelessness, including four sleeping on New York City streets and one living in a Bronx shelter with his young daughter. Then in spring 2020, a city caseworker presented Mr. Seifforth with a solution: a vacant apartment he could afford using a special city voucher.
The 11-story building on 133rd Street in Harlem, with its newly-finished rooms, balconies and Manhattan views, drew a stark contrast with the shelter, where Mr. Seifforth, 41, and his daughter, D'Kota-Holidae Seifforth, 9, said they encountered the biggest rats and cockroaches they had ever seen.
It was a chance for Mr. Seifforth, who had been living off food stamps and the wages he earned working part time for the Parks Department, to give D'Kota a real home.
The family moved in. Soon, most of the building's 46 units were filled with families with similar stories. Children settled in to nearby schools. Mr. Seifforth, 41, got a full-time job delivering packages for Amazon.
What the families did not know was that the building was already mired in a conflict that would soon leave them on the brink of homelessness again. Mr. Seifforth now lives every day worrying about whether a marshal will throw him and his daughter out.
"Sometimes I think, 'I should have just stayed in the shelter,"' he said.
The extraordinary saga of how a Harlem building beckoned a group of families desperate for a home, only to serve them another cruel twist, involves multiple lawsuits, accusations of fraud and a bankruptcy.
But it also represents how elusive stable, affordable housing can be in New York City, where the population in shelters rose to record levels this year. And it shows how the people living those struggles frequently have little control over how they are resolved.
"Housing should not be a privilege," Mr. Seifforth said.
The property he moved into with his daughter at 308 West 133rd Street used to be the site of a Harlem church that had fallen into disrepair. But in 2017, the developer Levi Balkany submitted a plan to build a new condo building there. Two years later, a limited liability company controlled by Mr. Balkany took out a $ 26 million loan to finish the building's construction.
Mr. Balkany quickly encountered difficulties with the loan he had taken from Arena Investors, an asset management firm that has also done business in the Caribbean and Spain. The firm said he defaulted on the loan at least three times in 2019, including for failing to pay interest, according to court records.
Mr. Balkany and his lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
After the city issued a new, higher tax assessment on the building in 2019, a lawyer for Mr. Balkany claimed in court that the increased prices for the condos would be too high for the "target market." He looked to a new, more stable source of revenue: renting the homes to those struggling with homelessness.
Under the plan, Mr. Balkany would rent to families who could not afford the apartments on their own but who were eligible for vouchers, which are rent supplements funded by the city and the state.
Voucher programs are crucial tools in curbing homelessness. Including coronavirus relief funds, the city spent roughly $ 350 million in the past fiscal year to help thousands of families find or keep stable homes through the programs.
In 2020, several of the Harlem apartments were added to the network of buildings that accept vouchers. Mr. Seifforth's caseworker at the Bronx shelter asked if he would like to go see the "brand-new" apartment. After a tour, fearing the opportunity would disappear, Mr. Seifforth took it.
"It was convenient and it's beautiful," he said.
Tonia Vail, 50, had spent almost two years in a Brooklyn shelter with her two children, while she worked at a car dealership nearby. The Harlem apartment, she said, was the first housing opportunity that her caseworker had pointed her to that was affordable and available to rent.
"It's not that we weren't looking," she said. "It was very hard, very hard. When she said she had this, I basically jumped on it. I didn't hesitate."
Soon after the families moved in, it became clear something was wrong.
In early 2020, Arena accused Mr. Balkany of trying to rent out the units in violation of the loan agreement, not properly registering the building with the city and not keeping proper insurance on the building, court records indicate. On June 5, 2020, as some families were still moving into the building, a limited liability company associated with Arena sued to block the leases.
"The tenants they have put in there without our consent are low-income tenants they're putting in because" of perceived "guarantees from the city," Casey Laffey, a lawyer representing the lender said in court in July 2020. "That ignores the very real risk of depriving this property of its value," he said.
A judge in July agreed to temporarily block Mr. Balkany from renting apartments. Days later, Mr. Balkany declared bankruptcy.
In July 2021, after months of bankruptcy court proceedings, Arena bought the property at a public auction.
"Within a year, I started to hear about the building, that it got sold or something to that effect," Mr. Seifforth said.
For a while, court records indicate the city and Arena were discussing whether there was a way to to keep the families there.
But in October 2021, a federal bankruptcy court rejected the existing leases at the property, saying it was in the best interests of Mr. Balkany's creditors. This March, Arena sued more than 40 tenants still living in the building in state court, saying their leases were invalid and that they should be thrown out.
This fall, a judge agreed.
"We are not trying to be unreasonable," Mr. Laffey said in court in September. "My client just wants this process to move. As you know, we have been dealing with this for two years as well."
Tenants like Mr. Seifforth now wonder how the city could have even placed them in a troubled building to begin with.
Neha Sharma, a spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services, said the pre-existing problems at the building were not something that could have been "anticipated or prevented."
In a July 2021 filing in federal bankruptcy court, a city lawyer said the social services department "reasonably relied" on Mr. Balkany's assertions that he was allowed to legally rent out the properties and said that it was not "customary" for the department to "investigate property owners before leasing units."
In response to further questions on what kind of vetting the department had conducted, it said that while it does check on landlords, having to conduct extensive financial analyses would be counterproductive to getting people housed.
In general, it said that its programs to house people -- even as thousands of migrants arrived in New York City this year seeking help, which put more demands on several short-staffed city agencies -- have been working. This year, the rate of people who had returned to shelters after being placed in subsidized homes, the Department explained, had declined.
This is not the case for many of the residents of 308 West 133rd Street, who have returned to shelters in the past month, including some who reportedly received payments from the new owners, said Don Curtis, founder and president of the Unified Black Caucus, a civil rights group that is helping organize the tenants.
"What happened to these people is through no fault of their own," he said.
The few dozen or so that remain in the building now scramble daily to find new homes, as they wait to see when they may be forced to leave.
A spokesman for the new building owners said they have worked with tenants to find new housing by "offering financial assistance and working with case managers and qualified brokers."
"This is certainly an unfortunate situation for all involved due to the previous owner's actions," the spokesman said.
He did not answer questions about how many tenants have found new homes, how many had received payments, whether the new owners will now try to sell the condos or when the marshals may proceed with the evictions.
Some tenants, like Georgette Hyman, 42, put up Christmas trees and decorations for the holiday season, even though they remained uncertain about how long they would be able to stay.
"My kids never went without, so I don't want them to go without now," she said.
Others, like Madeline Burdier, 43, who lives in the building with four children, have already begun packing up their belongings.
"The worst feeling in the world is not having a place for your kids to stay," she said.
Mr. Seifforth said both he and his daughter know they have to leave soon. He said D'Kota asks him if they will have to return to the place with the cockroaches. He tells her no, though he does not know where they will end up.
"I just want to go somewhere that's comfortable for her," he said.
