Full text: Sophia Cheng, the founder of Oddball, takes a snack tour around the city, breaks for tennis and wards off the Sunday scaries with Channing Tatum.
Growing up in Hong Kong and Singapore, Sophia Cheng delighted in snacks from across Asia, which were often made with ingredients like seaweed and dried seafood.
But when she moved to the United States to attend Bowdoin College in Maine and then moved to New York in 2015 to work in management consulting, her snacks became more Americanized.
"I'm just one of those people who loves junk food," she said. "I love chips and candy."
She found that even snacks marketed as "healthy" were still ultraprocessed. "I so often felt like I was getting catfished by my food," Ms. Cheng said.
So, in 2022 she created Oddball, a line of fruit jelly snacks that swaps out gelatin for agar and carob bean. "In Asia, I've seen jelly as a really fun and great vehicle for enjoying fruit in a different way," she said.
Ms. Cheng, 31, started Oddball in her kitchen with the help of her husband, Tanner Thexton, 30, who works in sales at Accenture. "We hand-ironed the lids on with a clothing iron, and we lugged around a big white cooler everywhere from New York to L.A.," she said. She started selling Oddball at farmers' markets around town, including the Brooklyn Museum Market and the Uptown Night Market, and now they're sold at Pop Up Grocer and online.
The couple's Kips Bay apartment in Manhattan set the backdrop for her startup. During the coronavirus pandemic, the couple snagged a move-in special for a two-bedroom apartment overlooking the East River.
SQUEEZE THE DAY We wake up pretty early, and I drink a glass of Hong Kong-style iced lemon tea. Tanner makes a batch for me each week. I drink it because I am not a big caffeine person, and it's very nostalgic because my mom drinks several glasses a day. Tanner drinks coffee, and we both have a supplement concoction. Then he makes us bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches on sourdough.
LET'S GET PHYSICAL Tanner's very fitness-focused because he was a college football player, so we like to play on the half court at Vanderbilt Tennis in Grand Central Station. Grand Central's special to us because we got married there, and the courts are a hidden gem (but now they've gotten popular).
SNACK TIME I know Grand Central's in a touristy spot, but it's our neighborhood. So after tennis, we go to Katagiri Japanese Grocery. It's like a Japanese bodega with high-quality ramen and sushi. It also has a spam musubi bar so we usually grab a couple. For me, trying snacks is a blend of finding inspiration for my company, and also treasure hunting for those small moments of indulgences throughout the week.
TACOS FOR TWO Afterward, we stop at Los Tacos -- a beef taco for me, pork for him. I love no-frills places with high-quality ingredients. Los Tacos is just your traditional street taco with great ingredients, and I'm out in five minutes.
A TASTE OF HOME We drop off our stuff and then bus to Chinatown. I would say I'm bicultural at this point, and Chinatown reminds me of home. My mother tongue is Cantonese, and I have this constant anxiety about losing my ability to speak my mother tongue, and my children not being able to speak it, and going to Chinatown allows me to practice. Our first stop is Noodle Village, which I think is the best Cantonese you can get in New York. We order the crab and pork soup dumplings and a lot of other dishes you can't get other places. Then we visit Na Tart for egg tarts and Malaysia Beef Jerky.
We go to Mango Mango for dessert. I obviously get a lot of inspiration from here because my first Oddball flavor was mango-coconut, and mango is just one of the best fruit bases out there. After a few more stops, we end our tour at Heytea, another place I draw inspiration from because they do one thing really well.
HAVE A NOTION? I'm an entrepreneur, so there's always a fire to put out, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. So every Sunday, I sit with my Notion and do life admin and work admin. I put my goals down for the month and the week. When I do this on a Sunday, it helps me to not feel overwhelmed, and on Monday I can dive right in.
FASHION FORWARD Every Sunday, I pick out my outfits for the week. Fashion's always been an important part of my life (my mom is very fashionable), and it's a way for me to express who I am. I don't have time to put outfits together during the week, so I put together a capsule wardrobe each month, and then pick outfits from that each week so I don't have to think about it.
TEAM WORK My husband is pretty much my co-founder. Even though I've raised money for Oddball, I still have that bootstrap mentality. Every Sunday, I have a list of people I need to send jellies to, whether it's journalists, V.I.P.s or investors, and Tanner helps me pack them up.
FANCY FRIED CHICKEN Coqodaq is my favorite restaurant in New York, and it's the only restaurant I'll line up for at 4:45 p.m. despite the cold weather. I think Simon Kim nailed the highbrow-lowbrow blend with his interpretation of Korean fried chicken. We order the fried chicken bucket, then we get a scoop of ice cream from Caffè Panna even though I'm lactose intolerant. But I love their olive oil ice cream.
HIT REWIND When we get home, I FaceTime with family and friends. I get really bad Sunday scaries, so I like to unwind with a Channing Tatum movie. It's usually "21 Jump Street" or "22 Jump Street." The sequel is my comfort movie. I've seen it like 20 times.

E. Coli Outbreak Is Over For McDonald's Eateries: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Federal health agencies closed their investigations into the bacterial outbreak that sickened 104 people and was linked to onions on the fast-food chain's signature Quarter Pounders.
Health officials have closed their investigations into an E. coli outbreak linked to raw onions on McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers that sickened more than a hundred people, the Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday.
In total, 104 people from 14 states were sickened from the contaminated food and 34 were hospitalized. One older person in Colorado died.
Officials said there did not appear to be a "continued food safety concern," because McDonald's had not served slivered onions -- which investigators determined to be the "likely source of contamination"-- on the Quarter Pounders for more than a month. The onions were recalled. And in many states, Quarter Pounders were removed from the menu altogether for several weeks.
There have not been any new illnesses since McDonald's decided to remove the onions from its menu on Oct. 22, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Evidence linking the onions to the food-borne illnesses was limited. According to the F.D.A., one sample from the recalled onions supplied by Taylor Farms, a large vegetable and fruit grower, and an environmental sample from an onion grower in Washington State tested positive for E. coli. But those samples did not match the bacterial strain found in those customers who became ill, the agency said.
Still, the F.D.A. investigation determined that the yellow onions were the likely source of the outbreak based on interviews with those who were sickened and from information provided by the distributors of the product. Of the people who recalled what they ate, roughly 84 percent had a menu item with slivered onions.
McDonald's identified Taylor Farms as its onion supplier in the Mountain West, and added that it would indefinitely discontinue the use of Taylor Farms onions from its Colorado Springs facility.
"The process to reach this point has at times felt long, challenging and uncertain," Michael Gonda, McDonald's North America chief impact officer, and Cesar Piña, the chief supply chain officer, said in a statement. "But it is critical that public officials examine every possible angle, and we are deeply grateful that they moved quickly to identify and, in partnership with McDonald's, contain the issue."
Illnesses related to the outbreak were first reported in late October, prompting McDonald's to recall its Quarter Pounder hamburgers in 10 states. Other fast-food chains including Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut and Burger King also stopped offering onions in their menu items as a precautionary measure.
McDonald's is now facing lawsuits from several customers claiming to have fallen ill from the outbreak. Its spokesmen said the company was "laser-focused" on regaining its customers' trust.

Jim Abrahams, 80, a Mastermind Of 'Airplane!' and 'Naked Gun,' Dies: [Biography]

Full text: Along with his fellow filmmakers David and Jerry Zucker, he revolutionized film comedy with a straight-faced, fast-paced style of parody.
Jim Abrahams, who with the brothers David and Jerry Zucker surely comprised one of the funniest trios of comedy writers in film history, layering on the yucks in classics like "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun," died on Tuesday at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 80.
His son Joseph said the cause was complications of leukemia.
Mr. Abrahams and the Zucker brothers -- often known around Hollywood as the "men from ZAZ" -- revolutionized film comedy with their straight-faced, fast-paced parodies of self-serious dramas like 1970s disaster films and police procedurals.
Along the way they littered pop culture with a trail of one-liners seemingly custom-cut to drop into daily conversation: "Have you ever seen a grown man naked?" "Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue." And "Nice beaver!"
Their films spawned an entire genre of spoof comedy, many of them pale, scruffy comparisons to the tight scripts and cleverly paced plots that gave the ZAZ films their punch.
The trio shared writing credits on five films, starting with "Kentucky Fried Movie" (1977), a compilation of parody sketches that grew out of a comedy show they developed after college in Madison, Wis., and took to Los Angeles in 1972. It was directed by John Landis, who would go on to direct "National Lampoon's Animal House" and "The Blues Brothers."
The idea for their second film, "Airplane!" (1980), came after they watched a 1957 thriller called "Zero Hour!" about an ill-fated passenger plane on which the crew is stricken with food poisoning, forcing one of the passengers, a psychologically scarred ex-pilot, to take control.
Minus the rat-a-tat gags, that's basically the plot of "Airplane!" In fact, it tracks the earlier film so closely that the writers bought the rights to it, to make sure they weren't sued.
They shopped the script around to studios, but at first no one bit. Not only did many executives fail to understand their brand of humor, but they resisted the trio's desire to direct and produce the film, as well as their insistence that they cast dramatic actors like Robert Stack and Leslie Nielsen instead of comedians.
Finally, Paramount said yes, but included a clause allowing the studio to fire all three after a week of production.
On the first day, the trio filmed one of the film's iconic scenes, in which a passenger, Dr. Rumack (Mr. Nielsen), discovering that bad fish has poisoned the crew and most of the other passengers, asks the recalcitrant Ted Striker (Robert Hays) for help.
"Can you fly this plane and land it?" Rumack asks.
"Surely you can't be serious," Striker replies.
"I am serious. And don't call me Shirley," Rumack says, full of gravitas.
Before you can say "Ha!" the scene has moved on to the next joke.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"When Paramount Pictures watched the dailies and saw that joke and the way it played, they were relieved," Mr. Abrahams told Vulture in 2016. "They finally understood the concept and were much more comfortable dealing with us."
The film, made for just $ 3.5 million (a little more than $ 14 million in today's currency), was a blockbuster, earning more than $ 171 million and winning over hordes of initially skeptical critics. Today "Airplane!" is considered by many to be one of the funniest movies ever made.
The Zuckers and Mr. Abrahams stumbled after "Airplane!" Their follow-up film, "Top Secret" (1984), a spy-thriller spoof starring Val Kilmer, bombed at the box office, though it has since acquired a cult following, while their attempt at a television series, the comedy "Police Squad" (also with Mr. Nielsen), was canceled after just six episodes, despite good reviews.
"We didn't quite get the importance of a story," Mr. Abrahams told Vulture. "We struggled coming up with a story for a while. We came up with a lot of bad ideas."
They rebounded with the movie "Ruthless People" (1986), starring Danny DeVito and Bette Midler, and then with "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!," a feature-length extension of the TV show directed by David Zucker, with Mr. Nielsen reprising his role as Detective Frank Drebin.
As they had done with "Airplane!" the trio began with a straightforward story -- this time about a plot to kill Queen Elizabeth II at a baseball game -- on which they draped nonstop jokes, cleverly treading a line between the profane and the absurd.
"We like to think of our humor as innocent," Mr. Abrahams told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1988. "There's lots of innuendo, but it's childlike. I'd take a 7-year-old to see that. The toilet humor -- they'd probably like that the best."
James Steven Abrahams was born on May 10, 1944, in Shorewood, Wis., a northern suburb of Milwaukee. His mother, Louise (Ogens) Abrahams, was an education researcher, and his father, Norman, was a lawyer.
The Zucker boys lived nearby and attended the same synagogue and high school as Mr. Abrahams and later the same college, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Though Mr. Abrahams was a few years older, the three bonded over their shared love for cutting up in class.
After graduating from college in 1966, Mr. Abrahams became an insurance adjuster and investigator.
One day, David Zucker called. He was assembling a crew of funny men to run an improv group and wanted Mr. Abrahams to help him and Jerry write material. "Kentucky Fried Theater" was born, and so was their shared career.
The ZAZ trio's work together ended with two sequels on which Mr. Abrahams and Jerry Zucker were credited only as executive producers: "The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear" (1991), which David Zucker directed, and "Naked Gun 33 ⅓: The Final Insult" (1994), for which David Zucker was one of three writers. Mr. Abrahams went on to direct several films on his own, including "Big Business" (1988), with Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin; "Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael" (1990), with Winona Ryder; "Hot Shots!" (1991) and "Hot Shots! Part Deux" (1993), both written with Pat Proft; and "Mafia!" (1998). He also wrote "Scary Movie 4" (2006), with Mr. Proft, which David Zucker directed.
He married Nancy Cocuzzo in 1978. In addition to their son Joseph, she survives him, along with another son, Charlie; their daughter, Jamie; and three grandchildren.
As a child, Charlie Abrahams developed a form of epilepsy, which sent his parents searching for a treatment. They eventually succeeded with a high-fat, ketogenic diet, an unconventional cure.
In 1994, Mr. Abrahams created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to support research. In 1997, he directed " ... First Do No Harm," a TV movie starring Meryl Streep that loosely tracked his family's experience.
When Vulture asked Mr. Abrahams for his favorite quote from "Airplane!" he said it came in a scene in which Dr. Rumack insists that the crew tell him confidential information. "You can tell me -- I'm a doctor," he says, as if his medical training made him an expert in all things.
"My family has absolutely been subjected to medical arrogance," Mr. Abrahams said. "Whatever that mentality is that allowed Leslie to say in the movie, 'You can tell me -- I'm a doctor,' has become satiric in my later life instead of just a parodic point of view."

Ford to Cut 4,000 Jobs
In Europe by 2027
Ford Motor said Wednesday that it would eliminate 4,000 jobs in Europe as the automaker struggled with slowing demand for electric vehicles and increased competition from Chinese companies.
The company said the jobs cuts, which will take place by the end of 2027, were part of a broader plan to strengthen its business in Europe. The reductions will primarily affect plants in Germany and Britain.
Ford added that it would reduce production of an electric version of its Explorer sport utility vehicle, which would result in shorter working hours at a plant in Cologne, Germany, in 2025.
The company said it was committed to building a thriving business in Europe. "It is critical to take difficult but decisive action to ensure Ford's future competitiveness in Europe," Dave Johnston, Ford's European vice president for transformation and partnerships, said in a statement.
Ford is pulling back as the auto industry tries to navigate the bumpy transition to electric vehicles. The growth rate of E.V. sales has slowed this year in some European countries. Ford has also struggled to sell as many battery-powered models as it had hoped in the United States and said in August that it would reduce the pace of investments in such vehicles.
Other automakers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have also shifted their strategies after reporting fewer sales of battery-powered vehicles than they had expected. GREGORY SCHMIDT

Campbell's Deletes Soup
From Corporate Name
Campbell's is ditching the soup -- at least in name. And the change has now received shareholders' greenlight.
Campbell Soup Co. announced its intention to change its name just over two months ago, saying it wanted to instead be known as the (slightly shorter) Campbell's Co. Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the change on Tuesday.
In a statement, CEO Mark Clouse maintained that this "subtle yet important change" will retain the company's iconic name "while reflecting the full breadth of our portfolio."
New Jersey-based Campbell's hasn't been exclusive to the soup business for some time. The company also owns brands like Prego sauce and Goldfish crackers -- and completed a $ 2.7 billion acquisition of Sovos Brands, the maker of Rao's pasta sauces, earlier this year.
Still, the 155-year-old food seller is most famous for its namesake canned soups, adorned with red and white labels. Its new name won't change that, the company says -- noting the Campbell's soup brand or packaging will not be affected.
"We love soup and always will," Clouse stated Tuesday. "The iconic red and white Campbell's soup labels that consumers love will be on shelves forever."
Campbell's is far from the first to attempt such as makeover. From Dunkin' to KFC, other food companies have rebranded themselves -- often shedding the mention of a specific item they were known for with a shorter corporate title, or even an updated logo -- in hopes of emphasizing other business.

Large Fast Food Chains Falling Short on Results
The Burger King parent Restaurant Brands and the KFC owner Yum Brands missed market estimates for quarterly results on Tuesday, hit by choppy demand in the United States and abroad from budget-stretched customers.
Increasing fast-food prices over the past year have prompted many consumers to prepare their own cheaper meals at home and avoid eating out, hurting traffic across the industry.
As a result, quick-service restaurant chains have turned to aggressive promotions in an attempt to attract value-seeking customers. Burger King, McDonald's, KFC and Wendy's have all launched $ 5 value meals since June this year to get lower-income customers back into their outlets.
"I don't think anybody's going to be out of trouble anytime soon," said Danilo Gargiulo, senior analyst at Bernstein. "But they're doing something that seems to be working to at least stop the deceleration in traffic." REUTERS

Nintendo Profits Off 60% As Switch Demand Wanes
Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario franchise, said on Tuesday that its profit fell 60 percent in the first half of the fiscal year, as demand waned for its Switch console, now in its eighth year since going on sale.
Kyoto-based Nintendo reported a 108.7 billion yen ( $ 715 million) profit for the April-September period, as sales slipped 34 percent from the previous year to 523 billion yen ( $ 3.4 billion).
More than 74 percent of its sales revenue came from overseas, according to Nintendo, which didn't break down quarterly numbers.
Global Switch sales during the period dropped to 4.7 million machines from 6.8 million units the previous year.
But Nintendo said that Switch sales continue and vowed to stick to its goal of selling a Switch console to each and every individual, not just one Switch per every household. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Lower Oil Prices Cause Aramco Profits to Fall
The Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported third-quarter profits of $ 27.5 billion on Tuesday, down about 15 percent from last year as low oil prices ate into its revenues.
Aramco had revenues of $ 111.1 billion over the quarter, the company said in a filing. It had $ 113 billion in revenues the same quarter last year. Profits for the third quarter last year were $ 32.5 billion. The profit decrease "was mainly due to the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins," Aramco said.
Profit for the first nine months of 2024 was $ 83.9 billion, down from $ 94.5 billion the year before.
Oil prices have been depressed in recent days as Middle East tensions appear to have receded slightly and as China's economy has slowed. Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday around $ 75 a barrel.
Aramco said it will pay dividends of $ 20.28 billion for the third quarter. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: He was hounded by a fat-phobic press, but as Dawn Porter's new documentary shows, he was a transformational presence from the start.
Beginning in the late 1970s, while making the transition from background singer to phenomenal solo act, Luther Vandross shaped the sound of commercialism as much as he shaped the sound of modern American music. He recorded lucrative jingles for Juicy Fruit, Miller beer and even Gino's pizza. During the Gino's session, he was asked to personify a sizzling hot pie coming from the oven, and he improvised by quickly dropping his tenor into the hadal zone of his body and retrieving it, like a free diver collecting pearls.
"I could see the control room just jumping up and clapping," he says in one of the interviews laced throughout "Luther: Never Too Much," a new documentary by Dawn Porter (in theaters).
It was a genius stroke. He developed a signature as recognizable as Whitney Houston's record-length notes or Mariah Carey's fluted crystalline range. Vandross's musical intelligence predated what is obvious in the era of TikTok: A distinct sound is worth the price of gold.
Vandross left a full, rich archive, yet there's still an emptiness at the heart of it that manages to come through in Porter's engrossing work. She starts her chronology with Vandross's second birth. In an interview clip early in the film, Oprah asks Vandross when he knew he could sing. He answers that he decided to sing after seeing Dionne Warwick perform in 1963 in Brooklyn. "I wanted to be able to affect people the way she affected me that day," he explains. Notice how he didn't specify a date. Notice how he knew the voice was always there. He just chose the way he wanted to use it.
In the film, a white interviewer asks Vandross, who grew up in the Alfred E. Smith Houses on the Lower East Side, if he was poor then. His response is earnest if not amused. "My impression of life growing up was great." He knew something that she did not: Money is only one kind of wealth.
In her essay on Black aesthetics, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," Zora Neale Hurston reveled in our desire to gild language, ideas, stories, gesture, clothing in resplendent layers of flamboyance. "There can never be enough of beauty, let alone too much," she observed. Hurston wrote her oracular essay in 1934, nearly 20 years before Luther Vandross was born, but she named a tradition that he would uphold in his own time.
Before he would perform as part of the group Luther or go out on his own, Vandross sang backup for everyone: Carly Simon, Diana Ross, Donna Summer, Chaka Khan, Bette Midler, "Sesame Street." Porter draws a new cosmology of a freer soul and R&B sound drifting down from Philadelphia in the late '60s and '70s. The music journalist Danyel Smith describes it in the documentary as an adult Motown, a scene that wasn't worried about matching outfits and "being in bed by midnight."
One afternoon, a friend of Vandross's, the guitarist Carlos Alomar, was called to record some music for David Bowie, who was in town to work on what would become his 1975 album, "Young Americans." Vandross tagged along, as his friends often did when others scored an enviable gig. During a lull, Vandross hummed his own arrangement of the chorus. Bowie was dazzled. Usually, in a film like this, an anointment from a white artist serves as a legitimization, a reference letter from a prestigious institution. Instead, Porter uses it to underline how Vandross transmogrified everything he touched.
Another great music documentary, "Summer of Soul" (2021), reminds us of the synchronicities between the explorations coming out of the Apollo Theater in Harlem and NASA's Apollo 11 mission: Both changed the course of human history, albeit from different vantage points of Earth.
When Vandross was ready to release his own music as a solo artist, none of the record labels would touch him; he had to ask his friends, including Cissy Houston, to lend their time for free. He directs them to play a song he wrote. At first, they were taken aback by its unusual bass line. The demo session became "Never Too Much," which the film understands as his most enduring masterpiece.
Though there's a deep trove to pull from, Porter keeps the focus on Vandross's live performances. His honesty and comfort onstage, along with his theatrics and exuberance, made him a legend.
Collective cultural processing has become its own genre of entertainment. Much of the work of contemporary documentaries is to reveal past pop-cultural metanarratives as apocryphal. They push us as viewers to reckon with a past that was shaped by a coterie of media organizations and anchors who were often serving their own best interests in capitalizing on the most salacious and scandalous stories. Perhaps, also, these documentaries help us practice our current media literacy.
Here, Porter makes the case that fat phobia terrorized Vandross and minimized his accomplishments. Music had its own Jim Crow, and Black artists were segregated on stages, in record stores, by genre. Vandross refused to be diminished. He saw his eight Grammys and 40 million albums sold as momentum for the civil rights movement. But it was his public weight fluctuations that interviewers pressed him on. The media didn't hide their fascination and repulsion at his appetite. People debated their preferences for "big Luther" or "little Luther" on television and in my high school.
For a while, he retaliated with sly pleasure. After Eddie Murphy took gibes at his size and eating habits during his 1987 stand-up special "Raw," Vandross wheeled out a prop basket of Kentucky Fried Chicken at a show. If Porter wanted to make a sequel to "The Substance," she has plenty of material. The film understands the way food is a demon that can live inside of you, too. Vandross told friends that food was a harmless vice, but years of disordered eating and weight fluctuations took their toll; he had diabetes and, eventually, suffered a stroke. And those were only the physical manifestations.
The media's relentless obsession with his weight pushed Vandross to withdraw from public view. Porter frames his reclusiveness as protection, which only made the rabid probing worse. His sexuality was scrutinized almost as much as his body; once, after a dramatic weight loss, there was even a rumor that he had contracted H.I.V. Another time, he watched a pastor on television say a prayer after a rumor circulated that he had died. Vandross, rightfully so, refused to entertain the violations of privacy. He owed the public nothing but "my best effort," he said. "That's all."
Vandross's voice touched listeners' hearts, and other parts of their anatomy, too. Vandross sang about love so much that fans gave him an honorary degree in it, nicknaming him the Love Doctor. Vandross knew a song was not a body, as the poet Saeed Jones once put it, but he poured so much of himself into his music and performances that the public mistook his genuine emotion for libidinousness, a common mistake given that the era would expand to include Keith Sweat and Maxwell. (Though America has a way of doing that to all Black men.)
The 1988 song "Any Love," which he described as his most autobiographical, included the lyrics "Now all you need is a chance to try any love." Max Szadek, his assistant, interpreted that as desperation. "He wasn't seeking love -- he was seeking any love," he tells Porter. But Vandross always seemed to sing with faith, not fear. "I don't consider myself unlovable," he told an offscreen interviewer. "But I'm still waiting."
The fulcrum of the film is heartbreak -- ours, not his -- that someone responsible for shaping the universal feeling of falling in love never experienced it himself. Acceptance arrived in his 2003 song "Dance With My Father" that finds peace in growing up well-loved in a home with both parents.
Vandross drifted back into the collective consciousness last summer when Solange Knowles (under the moniker of her art studio, Saint Heron) released a collection of handblown glassware. The beautiful objects were displayed in conjunction with a new installation: large screens showing a live 1989 performance of Vandross singing "A House Is Not a Home" at Wembley Stadium in England.
At Vandross's funeral in 2005 (the singer was 54), the ever-regal Dionne Warwick was helped to the lectern to give a eulogy. The film is punctuated with interviews with her and details about their lifelong friendship and collaboration. (She first sang the lyrics that Vandross readorned and that later inspired Knowles's beautiful home décor.) Warwick's speech is brief. "His legacy, will live on, forever."

E. Coli Outbreak Shouldn't Affect Earnings, McDonald's Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fast-food giant's earnings results did not reflect the potential fallout from an E. coli outbreak that the company said it moved quickly to contain.
McDonald's is aiming to move past the E. coli outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in recent weeks, projecting the food safety scare will not affect its full-year finances.
The company's quarterly earnings results, released on Tuesday, did not reflect any fallout from the recent health crisis, which was linked to the chain's popular Quarter Pounder burgers and had spread to 13 states. Health officials said the outbreak sickened 75 people and caused one death in Colorado.
McDonald's executives told investors on a call Tuesday morning that they did not expect the episode, which started in late September, to have any "material" effect on the company's 2024 earnings.
But they did acknowledge that public perception issues could linger; regaining trust around food safety and rebuilding momentum in its business could be a challenge, they said. Since the start of the E. coli outbreak, the company's daily U.S. sales have fallen and fewer customers have visited its restaurants, Ian Borden, McDonald's chief financial officer, told investors on Tuesday.
"We stand ready to do more, if we need to, to make sure that we are bringing the full resources of McDonald's to bear to re-engage the customer," Chris Kempczinski, the chain's chairman and chief executive, said on the call.
Jeff Farmer, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, said in a research note that foot traffic at McDonald's in the United States was down 9.5 percent late last week from year-ago levels. He added that states with more reported E. coli cases had greater declines: 33 percent in Colorado and 26 percent in Wyoming.
McDonald's is aiming to return to the success it saw in its latest quarter, before news of the food safety crisis started to spread. Thanks to $ 5 meal deals, McDonald's managed to keep people coming into its restaurants, gaining market share with lower-income consumers for the first time in more than a year.
Although global same-store sales slipped 1.5 percent in the quarter ending Sept. 30 from year-earlier levels, same-store sales in the United States increased 0.3 percent in the quarter, the company reported Tuesday.
McDonald's earnings are a closely watched barometer for consumer spending, especially among lower-income customers who have been tightening their belts over the past year. The company introduced the $ 5 meal promotion this summer and then extended it through the end of the year in a majority of its markets.
"We will stay laser-focused on providing an unparalleled experience with simple, everyday value and affordability that our consumers can count on as they continue to be mindful about their spending," Mr. Kempczinski said in a statement.
Overall, McDonald's reported that global revenue for the third quarter rose 3 percent to $ 6.8 billion while net income fell 3 percent to $ 2.3 billion.
On Sunday night, the Department of Agriculture in Colorado, the state with the most reported E. coli cases, said the beef patties on the Quarter Pounder were not the source of the contamination.
Instead, federal investigators appear to be scrutinizing slivered yellow onions from the Colorado Springs location of Taylor Farms, a multistate producer of vegetables and fruits. Last week, Taylor Farms voluntarily recalled several of its yellow onion products because of "potential E. coli contamination."
McDonald's -- which had stopped serving the Quarter Pounder in some places -- said in response to the findings that the item would be back on the menu at thousands of locations, but would not be topped with slivered onions in 900 of those sites. Several other fast-food chains, including Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut and Burger King, have stopped including onions in some of their menu items in the affected region as a precautionary measure.
Any fallout from the E. coli outbreak will most likely be "minimal and short-lived," analysts at Wedbush Securities said in a research note last week. An E. coli outbreak at Chipotle Mexican Grill starting in 2015 resulted in years of reputational harm and a $ 25 million fine, but McDonald's "has the scale and expertise to respond and contain far more quickly," the analysts said.
"We are anticipating this company's leading supply chain will make quick fixes to this problem as already messaged, and don't expect this to engulf the U.S. or certainly international," JPMorgan analysts said in a note last week, stressing that they do not expect the episode to cause long-term harm to the brand.
McDonald's strong supply chain and tracing capabilities are working in the company's favor to avoid substantial harm as a result of the outbreak, according to Sara Senatore, a restaurants analyst at Bank of America. The effect will largely depend on how long the health scare remains in the news, and coverage already appears to be dissipating, she said.
Had it not been for the E. coli developments, investors would have been paying closest attention to signs of demand among U.S. consumers, and McDonald's success in focusing on value given the pressure on consumer spending, Ms. Senatore added.
"They had been seeing more pressure than they had anticipated at the beginning of the year on consumer spending," she said. "That would be the No. 1 focus."

Onions Likely Culprit
In McDonald's Outbreak
McDonald's announced on Sunday that tests in Colorado had ruled out its Quarter Pounder beef patties as the source of a deadly E. coli outbreak, and said that the popular burger would be back on the menu at thousands of locations in a dozen states.
But the company said that in 900 of those sites, Quarter Pounders would not be topped with raw slivered onions -- which federal regulators have identified as the likely culprit in the outbreak that health officials said had sickened 75 people and caused the death of one Colorado resident.
In a statement, McDonald's cited tests conducted in Colorado, the state that had the most cases reported in the outbreak. On its website, the state's Agriculture Department said that tests were done on "dozens of subsamples from all the lots and all samples were found to be negative for E. coli."
Colorado health officials tested beef samples from the two beef suppliers that provided patties to the 900 affected locations in a dozen states, McDonald's representatives said.
As for the slivered onions, McDonald's said on Friday it would stop buying onions from the Colorado Springs site of its major regional supplier Taylor Farms, a multistate producer of vegetables and fruits. Last week, Taylor Farms recalled several yellow onion products -- among them diced and slivered -- because of "potential E. coli contamination."
Several other fast-food chains, including Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut and Burger King, have stopped offering onions in their menu items as a precautionary measure in the region.
Among the 75 people who became ill, at least a quarter were hospitalized, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two developed a serious kidney condition associated with E. coli, the agency said. The illnesses were reported between Sept. 27 and Oct. 10. TEDDY ROSENBLUTH
TECHNOLOGY
AT&T and Corning Agree On an Internet Deal
AT&T said on Monday that it had struck a $ 1 billion multiyear deal with Corning to buy fiber, cable, and connectivity solutions, as the telecom giant looks to expand its high-speed internet services.
With the wireless market facing a slowdown, telecom companies such as AT&T and its rival Verizon have doubled down on their high-speed internet businesses, an area that has long been dominated by broadband companies such as Comcast.
Demand has also been growing for AT&T's plans that allow customers to combine its high-speed fiber data with its wireless phone service for a discount.
The company expects the deal with Corning to boost its network expansion and enhance performance while minimizing deployment costs.
In the third quarter, AT&T reported 28.3 million fiber passings, or the number of potential customer locations a fiber network passes by.
It remains on track to report more than 30 million fiber passings by the end of 2025.
AT&T's fiber business added 226,000 customers in the third quarter, falling short of expectations for 257,860 additions, according to Visible Alpha. REUTERS

E. Coli Cases Tied to Onions At McDonald's Keep Growing: [National Desk]

Full text: Health officials say that recalls of onions -- the suspected source of the contamination -- would help lessen the risk to consumers. Other major fast-food chains have also stopped offering onions.
The number of people hospitalized from the E. coli outbreak linked to raw onions on McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers has more than doubled, and those reporting they have been sickened rose to 75, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday.
Illnesses of people ranging in age from 13 to 88 were reported in 13 states. Additionally, the C.D.C. said a second person had developed the life-threatening condition associated with E. coli called hemolytic uremic syndrome.
While cases had been originally clustered in the Mountain West, updated data from the C.D.C. now shows cases in Michigan, Washington and Oregon. It is still unclear whether those people ate at McDonald's in their home states or stopped at one of the restaurants while traveling. The Washington state health department said that a resident of the state fell ill after a trip to Colorado.
One older person in Colorado has died in the outbreak. The C.D.C. said the most recent illness occurred on Oct. 10, although the agency said more cases could be reported because it can take three to four weeks to determine whether an illness is part of the outbreak.
Federal health officials said they hoped the risk to consumers would now be lower because onions have been recalled in many of those states, and many other fast-food chains including Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut and Burger King also decided to stop offering onions in their menu items as a precautionary measure.
News of the outbreak broke this week when the C.D.C. issued a food safety alert, as McDonald's pulled its Quarter Pounders from locations in 10 states.
The fast-food chain and the Food and Drug Administration have said preliminary investigations indicated that the raw, slivered onions served mainly atop the popular quarter-pound beef patties were a "likely source of contamination." McDonald's has also stopped providing fresh onions on its other burger items in the region.
McDonald's identified Taylor Farms as its onion supplier in the Mountain West and that company has since recalled several yellow onion products -- slivered, diced and whole -- because of "potential E. coli contamination."
Taylor Farms, a major fruit and vegetable supplier, said it preemptively recalled yellow onions from its Colorado facility that it sends to "select food service customers," that have been notified.
On Friday, McDonald's said that it would discontinue the use of Taylor Farms onions from its Colorado Springs facility indefinitely. It said slivered onions from that company were distributed to about 900 of its restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming and other states. Some also were consumed at McDonald's locations in airport hubs, which the company said might account for illnesses in some other states. Other restaurants that were customers and received the recalled onions have been notified and asked to remove the vegetables, the C.D.C. said.
McDonald's has halted sales of Quarter Pounders at restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Other hamburger items are not affected by the outbreak, the company emphasized.
Regulators are still investigating whether the ground beef in the Quarter Pounder patties could have been a source of the bacteria.
One lawsuit has already been filed by a resident who became sick after eating at a McDonald's in Colorado, according to the law firm Ron Simon and Associates. That state has the higher number of cases, 26, the C.D.C. said, with Montana at 13 and Nebraska 11.

‘Quiet Place’ in Pennsylvania Is Thrust Into Loud Immigration Debate

CHARLEROI, Pa. — Amos Vougar felt as if he had found just about everything he needed when he arrived in the small Pennsylvania town of Charleroi. The people were welcoming, the rent was cheap, and he soon moved up the job ranks at a food processing plant, allowing him to send money to his wife and children back in Liberia.
Three years later, things now feel drastically different.
A rapid influx of immigrants like Vougar into Charleroi over the past two years, many of them fleeing violence in Haiti, has led to the kind of discord now being seen in towns across the country that for years were relatively untouched by immigration. Former President Donald Trump fanned the flames this month, claiming that immigrants had brought “massive crime” to Charleroi and asking, “Has your beautiful town changed?”
To Vougar, the sudden flood of gripes, fears and rumors from longtime residents has threatened the serene life he thought he had found in the green hills of Charleroi, which lies along the winding Monongahela River an hour south of Pittsburgh.
“Things changed greatly,” Vougar said this week. “All the immigrants in the Charleroi community right now are living in fear.”
He found himself growing upset recently when a cashier at a store dismissively assumed that he did not know English.
Once a glass manufacturing hub, Charleroi had been shrinking for years as residents watched one employer after another pack up and leave, so Vougar thought the arrival of immigrants would be seen as a boon to the town.
Many immigrants have opened businesses along the borough’s main avenue, where a store selling Trump apparel stands not far from another selling Pittsburgh Steelers gear. At some of the remaining factories in town that were struggling to find workers, immigrants fill the assembly lines.
Plenty of longtime residents also applauded what they saw as new lifeblood for the town. But not everyone.
A musician said his bandmates were now afraid to venture downtown for jam sessions, fearing that migrants were causing a rise in crime, which local officials said was not true. A woman spoke with contempt about a local grocery store that she said was refusing entry to white people — also not true. And a rumor made its way to the borough manager that a tent city was forming in a pharmacy parking lot, but the only people in the lot Thursday night were two parents watching their son do loops on a lime-green scooter.
To be sure, Vougar said, the arrival of so many new immigrants had changed things in the town. Rents have gone up, he said, and with so many new shoppers, a nearby Walmart store often runs out of things he needs.
The latest census count, in 2020, put the borough’s population at about 4,200 people. Borough officials estimate that about 2,000 immigrants are now living in Charleroi, many of whom arrived after the last census. That figure includes roughly 700 people from Haiti.
Many of the new arrivals moved here to work at a food packing plant, Fourth Street Foods, where a diverse group of migrants assembled breakfast sandwiches and bowls on a recent workday, packing the products into boxes and moving large pallets through fluorescent-lit corridors.
Dave Barbe, the president of the company, said immigrants were doing jobs that he had been unable to fill with American-born workers. Entry-level jobs at the plant could be difficult, he said: monotonous work on a factory floor that must be kept cold — 40 degrees or under, to keep the food safe — and that fewer Americans were willing to do.
“They just don’t grow on trees anymore,” he said. “I can’t blame a lot of the younger people, because it isn’t a glorious position, starting out, to be on an assembly line. You might put the lids on 60,000 sandwiches a day.”
Tightening the economic squeeze in town is the expected closure of a glass plant that makes Pyrex products. It has been a source of community pride, harking back to the borough’s more bountiful industrial days, and its demise would mean a loss of more than 300 jobs in Charleroi.
“It’s been a real gut punch to the community, because it’s going to sap away the last fragments of this town’s identity,” said Joe Manning, the borough manager. “People are sort of disaffected that their lifestyles have changed, that their industry is gone, and so they look for someone to blame.”
Manning said he believed that most Charleroi natives had been welcoming to the recent migrants, but he worried that Trump had given a “license” to residents who are most opposed to immigration.
Still, he and others said they were baffled by the attention that their town has received since Charleroi (pronounced SHAR-luh-roy) first came to Trump’s attention. (“What a beautiful name,” Trump said, pausing before he read it from a teleprompter the first time he mentioned it at a rally. “But it’s not so beautiful now.”)
“Charleroi’s been a quiet place, and it is still a quiet place,” said Getro Bernabe, a former member of the Haitian coast guard who became Charleroi’s first immigrant community liaison last year. Bernabe said many immigrants had come to town after hearing from others about job opportunities and a low cost of living.
Now, as the town has been thrust into the national spotlight, he said he has increasingly been hearing from immigrants who are anxious and who ask him whether it is safe to send their children to the local schools.
The Charleroi schools sit far up on a hill north of town, on a campus surrounded by thick trees, and in many ways are an oasis from the political strife below. When classes let out at the elementary school on a recent day, the biggest challenge seemed to be getting the children to stop running as they raced to the buses. A Haitian child implored another in Haitian Creole to share his spicy Doritos chips.
Administrators have struggled to handle the surge of new students. They have had to expand English learning programs, restructure classrooms and find new ways to communicate with parents.
A few years ago, the percentage of elementary school students enrolled in English-learning classes in the district was in the low single digits. Now, in kindergarten — the grade with the highest figure — the share is about 35%, according to Mark Killinger, who serves as principal for kindergarten through second grade and coordinates the district’s English-learning program.
“We’re just like, ‘Oh, my gosh, what are we going to do?’” he said. “It was just kind of a shock to the system.”
Space is so tight that one English language teacher is working with students in a closet at the back of a classroom.
At a time when many rural schools are losing students and shutting down, an increase in population is a good problem to have, Killinger said. But it has taken long hours of extra work to ensure that students are getting everything they need.
He acknowledged that some local parents had pulled their children out of the public schools over concerns about the arrival of immigrant students, opting for online classes or charter schools instead.
Joeby Charlecin, a high school senior who grew up in Haiti and arrived in Charleroi a year and a half ago, vividly recalls the frightening conditions in his homeland that made his family feel that staying there was untenable. Men in gangs once arrived outside his younger sister’s school and sent students into a panic, he said. On another day, Charlecin, 18, learned that a friend of his late father had been killed and mutilated by a gang.
Charlecin said he had felt a sense of gratitude and determination when he arrived in Charleroi.
“I was like, I’ve got a chance that a lot of people will never have,” he said. “Probably, right now, there’s someone dying back in my country who will never have this chance that I’ve got.”
He taught himself English, first by watching YouTube videos and then moving on to Netflix. Eventually, he put his knowledge to the test by trying to flirt with girls — and asking, at the end of each conversation, “Do you think my English is good?”
As his skills improved, teachers began turning to him at times to help translate for other Haitian students. Some people at the school have come to call him “the mayor" for his willingness to help bridge cultures. He took jobs at KFC and then a bowling alley to save up for a car.
He said he was well aware of what Trump had said about Charleroi and was concerned about the idea that politicians might want to send Haitian immigrants back to their home country. “I’ve already invested a lot here,” he said.
But for the most part, he said, he is trying to keep his head down and focus on his own future.
Among those in town who have welcomed the change with open arms is Amy Nelson, an assistant principal for sixth through 12th grades, who took in a 6-year-old Haitian girl whose mother died of cancer shortly after they immigrated.
Nelson said the girl quickly became part of her family, even though she struggles with the trauma of the journey to America and her mother’s death.
The girl has had to learn not to gorge herself after years of going without enough food, she said, and Nelson has had to learn how to braid her hair.
Charleroi has always been a close-knit town, almost to a fault, she said. The recent talk about the immigrants — nationally and locally — has made her nervous, especially since one is now a member of her family.
Sometimes, she said, after a day of seeing the children at school managing to get along, she thinks, “I wish the parents acted more like the kids.”

PARIS — Christine Marlier was angry when President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election this summer. She’s even angrier now that he appointed a right-wing prime minister, despite the fact that a leftist bloc won the most seats in parliament.
But Marlier left that anger behind at home in the far northeast of France when she boarded a bus for a four-hour ride to a nearly 100-year-old festival on the outskirts of Paris that celebrates left-wing politics in general, and French communism in particular.
The Fête de l’Humanité — festival of humanity — is an unlikely mix of Burning Man, Woodstock and a political convention.
“We are never angry here,” Marlier, 51, said in between doing 1 euro shots of alcohol with her husband, their faces decorated by sparkles.
They were standing in the middle of a dirt lane, between large white booths set up by Communist Party associations from around the country, offering the food specialties of their regions — including raw oysters and steamed lobsters, giant pans of tartiflette, and axoa, a minced veal dish from the Basque region.
A loudspeaker advertised the coming debate between the head of the French Communist Party, Fabien Roussel, and one of the country’s top union leaders, but Marlier and her husband were already tipsy. They were planning on seeing some bands play instead.
“Here, we’re in a suspended dream, outside our daily problems and worries,” said Marlier, who works with handicapped children in elementary schools in the département of Moselle, bordering Germany and Luxembourg.
Every year, usually during the second weekend of September as the country is shaking off its vacation slumber, the festival’s organizers build a huge village out of the mud and grass of an abandoned military airport, in the distant nether regions of Paris where suburban homes give way to corn fields. Up go the stages, and up go some 350 large booths in long lines to make streets, which are often named after dead French communist heroes.
Every year, dozens of musicians come to perform. In the past, they’ve included acts like Manu Chao, Pink Floyd, Ray Charles and Youssou N’Dour, and French stars like Aya Nakamura and Zaho de Sagazan.
And in all those booths, hundreds of political debates, lectures and Q&A sessions are held throughout the festival’s three days. This year there were 360, running morning to evening.
That meant Saturday afternoon, you could see a union leader square off against the head of an employers association; or settle into the large film tent to watch Judith Godrèche’s latest short film, “Moi Aussi,” on the prevalence of rape; or see a children’s play; or dash over to the Angela Davis stage to listen to French musician Santa belt out lyrical songs — all more or less at the same time.
Or you could try to squeeze into the crowd pouring into the “agora” — the central red booth where the big-ticket speeches happen — to see Davis herself. The retired California philosophy professor, activist and communist presidential candidate was back at the festival for the third time since 1973.
“Hope is a discipline which you have to cultivate,” she said, her voice reverberating over loudspeakers. “Because without it, there is no possibility of moving forward.”
The Fête de l’Huma, as the faithful call it, began in 1930 to raise money for the official Communist Party newspaper, L’Humanité. The left-wing daily is no longer the party’s official organ, but it continues to run the festival.
The budget has climbed to about 8 million euros, but the festival barely breaks even most years, said L’Humanité’s publisher, Fabien Gay, who also is an elected communist senator.
That’s because the newspaper refuses to raise ticket prices, in keeping with the founding idea that the festival should offer culture to workers. The top price for three days of 60 music concerts is just 60 euros — the typical cost of a single concert in Paris, Gay pointed out.
“This is for us communists, this is what we fight for — everything that is exceptional and grandiose must remain accessible to everyone,” said Roussel, the French Communist Party leader, who spent some of the fete in full-on campaign mode, shaking hands, slapping backs and visiting party booths from across the country, even though no election is near.
During an interview, he fondly remembered 1988, when French designer Yves Saint Laurent put on a fashion show — which he called a “work of art,” comparable to the “Mona Lisa” or “Guernica” by Picasso, who also, incidentally, had exhibitions of his work here.
“Bodies must be always nourished, but so must minds,” Roussel said.
When you arrive at the fete, 22 miles south of central Paris, it feels as if you’ve entered an alternative universe, where the Communist Party is joyfully running France and not continually losing seats in the National Assembly, including Roussel’s last summer. The party has just nine seats in the 577-seat legislature.
Here, it’s not KFC but CFK: Communist Fried Kitchen, with Colonel Sanders transformed into Karl Marx. Red flags with the hammer and sickle flap from the awnings of booths, and people wear Communist Party shirts and hats.
In 1945, with the memory of the prominent role played by French communists in the Resistance still fresh, some 1 million people crammed into the festival. This year, the attendance was 450,000, according to Gay. While many come just for the music, organizers hope some will drift into a lecture or debate — particularly those camping in the 8,000 or so tents set up along the fete’s flank.
“Millions of French people were communists at one moment of their life, and they come back each year because they feel part of the family,” said Frédérick Genevée, a high school history teacher who has written four books on French communist history, the most recent of which he was signing at the festival’s book fair. “It’s confirmation in what we believe in.”
Most of the labor at the festival is done by 10,000 volunteers who arrive in convoys, towing stoves, refrigerators, mattresses and kegs of beer from as far away as Biarritz, 475 miles away.
Over two weeks, they work to build their regional booths, set up kitchens and sleeping quarters, and stay up late to talk. In many families, it’s a tradition going back generations.
“It gives us a taste of what the world could be,” said Catherine Lavauzelle, 64, a retired teacher who started coming with her father to volunteer at age 7. “If we all gave the best of ourselves and weren’t always in competition with one another.”
The cheap wine and beer help with the bonding. Add music, and you have a surefire recipe for love, which Genevée said was another festival theme. He met two of his former wives here.
Gregory Moser not only met his wife, Noémie, here; he married her on-site 11 years ago.
“We were married in the Cuba booth, had our wine reception in the People’s Republic of China booth,” Moser said with a laugh outside the regional booth from Charente, where the couple continue to volunteer. After the wedding ceremony, friends drove the newlyweds around the festival in a golf cart trailing cooking pans.
People often predict the festival’s demise. They are always proved wrong.
Similarly, every year, once the revelers have cleared out, and Lavauzelle is bleary-eyed and packing up the sinks and stoves, peeling the tents up off the muddy ground, and beginning the long drive back home, she swears it will be her last. But it never is.
“It’s the feeling that draws us back,” she said. “It helps me feel better for the rest of the year, when I return to real life.”

Struggling to Stem Extremism, Tajikistan Targets Beards and Head Scarves

DUSHANBE, Tajikistan — People in Tajikistan were expecting a government crackdown after Tajik men were arrested and charged with a terrorist attack on a Moscow concert hall in March.
But it still seemed excessive to Nilufar, a 27-year-old education professional, when she saw local authorities with scissors outside a KFC in Dushanbe, Tajikistan’s capital, trimming beards that were deemed too long.
Excessive, but not so surprising. In the span of a month, Nilufar herself had been stopped three times by authorities for wearing a hijab in public.
“Nowadays, as soon as you go outside, you can actually feel how the raids have intensified,” Nilufar said in a recent interview in Dushanbe, providing only her first name because of fear of retribution.
With a population of 10 million, the vast majority of whom are Muslim, Tajikistan has many challenges that counterterrorism experts say make it an incubator for extremism: poverty, poor education, high unemployment and grievances against an autocratic government that severely restricts the practice of religion.
In the face of these challenges, critics say, Tajikistan has continued to restrict how Islam can be taught and practiced and increasingly implemented superficial policies regulating head scarves and beard lengths.
The country came under global scrutiny after four Tajik men were charged as the assailants in the worst terrorist attack in Russia in two decades, which killed 145 people and injured more than 500 at the Moscow concert hall. Other Tajiks were later arrested in connection with the attack.
American officials have said that Islamic State Khorasan Province, a branch of the Islamic State group known as ISIS-K, was responsible for the attack, and radicalized Tajiks have in recent months caught the attention of governments and counterterrorism experts around the world.
Tajik adherents of the Islamic State group have also been involved in terrorist attacks in Iran and Turkey, as well as thwarted plots in Germany, Austria and elsewhere. Last month two Tajiks helped stage a mutiny at a Russian prison, state news agency TASS reported, adding that they claimed to be motivated by radical Islam.
The attacks have tarnished the country’s image abroad, especially in Russia, where about 1 million Tajiks — 10% of Tajikistan’s population — toil in low-skilled jobs to send money home.
The government’s response, overseen by President Emomali Rahmon, an authoritarian leader who has been in power for more than three decades, has been to crack down.
“In Tajikistan, authorities are getting frustrated by the international stigma they’re receiving and the blame they’re getting for all these attacks,” said Lucas Webber, co-founder of Militant Wire, whose research focuses on the Islamic State group. “So they’re just doubling down, being heavy-handed.”
Tajiks have long been accustomed to restrictions that would surprise many Westerners, with legislation governing conduct at weddings, birthdays and even funerals (“extravagant emotions” are banned at memorials). Hijabs — head scarves that cover a woman’s neck and generally don’t reveal any strands of hair — have been banned in schools since 2007 and public institutions since 2009.
But in June, parliament passed a law banning “clothes alien to Tajik culture,” a term the government often uses for clothing it considers Islamic. Hijabs are a target.
The law imposes fines of between 7,000 and 15,000 somoni, or about $660 and $1,400, in a country where the average monthly salary is just above $200.
The rationale appears to be that stamping out public signs of conservative Islam will help tamp down conservative Islam itself — and potentially reduce Islamic extremism.
But Webber said the government’s reaction only added fuel to the fire.
“The terrorists who planned the Moscow attack could not have asked for better responses from the Tajik government,” he said. “Because they want to stoke tensions, they want backlash.”
Several Tajik government bodies responsible for implementing the laws declined to meet with The New York Times in Dushanbe or respond to emailed requests to comment.
Tajikistan is a mountainous country in Central Asia bordered by Afghanistan, China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. It is heavily reliant on Russia economically and its leaders maintain a very close relationship.
Outside the KFC, several women who were with the men trimming beards approached Nilufar and a friend. The women said they were from the Committee on Women and Family Affairs, a government body that advises on and implements state policy. They asked the two women to remove their head scarves.
Nilufar tried to explain that she did not normally wear a head covering, but was mourning her mother’s death.
“The women told me, ‘All this is being done for a reason,’” Nilufar said. Many Tajiks had been involved in terrorist attacks, they told her, adding that fundamentalists from Afghanistan had come to the country.
“They sport long beards and their wives wear head coverings,” she said the women told her, and it had become difficult for authorities to catch them, “because we also dress like them, and it’s hard to tell the difference.”
The women wanted to fine Nilufar. She called an uncle with government connections, who told them to leave her alone.
But when she was stopped in June a third time, she said, this time by police, she had to spend the night in a cell because she refused to sign a document accepting that she had broken the law.
“When I got to the station, there were already about 15, even 17 women wearing head scarves sitting in the cell, including an older woman who was at least 50,” she said.
In the morning, the station chief arrived — an acquaintance from her university course — and released her. “My husband was angry with me, and worried,” Nilufar said. But he understood what she had been through: He had previously spent five nights in jail before agreeing to trim his beard.
After the experience, Nilufar finally decided to stop wearing her hijab, because she was worried that a stain on her record could hinder her ability to work.
That kind of policing has been a focus of ISIS-K propaganda published in Tajik, among other languages, said Riccardo Valle, research director of The Khorasan Diary, a research and media platform about the terrorist group.
The propaganda also makes much of crackdowns on Tajiks in Russia, where authorities have conducted raids on migrant dormitories that house Central Asian guest workers, and have requested documents from people in public places, effectively racially profiling them.
Experts interviewed by the Times said the strategy of strictly monitoring physical appearance is not an effective way to combat extremism, because it breeds resentment. It is also ineffective, they said, because radicalized extremists might try to remain inconspicuous by avoiding outward signs of religiosity.
Family members of two of the men accused of carrying out the Moscow attack said neither had shown any external signs of religiosity.
“My son was never a practicing Muslim,” said Gulrakat Mirzoyeva, 59, mother of Dalerjon Mirzoyev, one of the men charged in the assault. “Sometimes he prayed, but not really.”
All four of the accused attackers had been working in Russia for at least several months, some making repeated trips in and out. Many experts say that it is not only crushing poverty at home but degrading experiences of migration that drive Tajik citizens into the hands of militants.
Tajiks who join groups like ISIS-K “are almost all Tajiks who were migrant laborers and were radicalized outside Tajikistan via social networks,” said Bruce Pannier, a Central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia.
Mirzoyev had done four stints of six to eight months working in Russia to provide for his wife and their four children. Their home, in a dusty village on the Tajik steppe, has no running water.
Shamsidin Fariduni, another man accused in the attack, had become an observant Muslim after time in prison. His mother, Muyassara Zargarova, insisted he was not an extremist.
He went to work in Russia repeatedly because of financial pressure, she said. First he needed to pay for his wedding, then for medical help when his wife developed pregnancy complications. And when the baby was born with breathing problems, he and his brother went back to look for work once more.
In the aftermath of the concert hall attack, Tajik authorities have increased security cooperation with Moscow. Rahmon has also increased ties with Beijing, though China has denied media reports that it is building a base in northwestern Tajikistan.
The United States and Tajikistan signed an agreement in May to use software that will notify U.S. authorities in real time if travelers who are considered suspicious enter Tajikistan.
But the state needs to be doing more, said Larisa Aleksandrova, a Dushanbe-based expert on human rights.
Instead of tackling substantive problems like corruption, poverty, and social inequality, she said, the state is focusing on “where to put a comma in a sentence, what to name a particular ministry or what clothes, for example, women or men should wear.”
“It distracts us by talking about problems which, in my opinion, are not so relevant,” she said.

Undanceable? That's Impossible.: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Sarah McCreanor, or Smac, has attracted millions of followers with her reproductions of the weird-yet-familiar images and memes that shape internet culture.
Like comedians, dancers tend to be good imitators. They're both masters of fine detail, able to pinpoint and replicate the minutiae that make a choreographic phrase, or a sketch character, click into focus.
As a dancer and a comedian, Sarah McCreanor, known as Smac, likes to up the ante. Why mimic a dance or a person when you can turn yourself into an emoji? A head-bobbing chicken? An object being crushed by a hydraulic press?
"I think one of the funniest things you can do is try to dance the undanceable," McCreanor said in a Zoom interview. "I look at, like, a video of a hydraulic press crushing something, and I see choreography."
You have to go back a generation or two to find a good analogue for the 32-year-old McCreanor. Her physical comedy evokes the vaudevillian slapstick of Donald O'Connor or Lucille Ball. But she's figured out how to translate that fundamentally retro style for a very online audience. On her TikTok and Instagram accounts, where she calls herself "a variety show," she's attracted millions of followers with her dancerly reproductions of the weird-yet-familiar images and memes that shape internet culture.
Recently, McCreanor even earned the endorsement of the venerable National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia. (She grew up in Brisbane, though she now lives in Los Angeles.) The museum featured a large assortment of McCreanor's social media videos in "Hydraulic Press Girl," part of its Triennial exhibition.
It might have been the funniest Smac moment yet: austere gallery walls filled with elegant screens, on which McCreanor was turning herself into the eggplant emoji or a smushed roll of Lifesavers. Christopher Guerrero, who teaches a course on viral comedy at the University of Southern California, said it felt akin to the Dada antics of the artist Marcel Duchamp.
"When you put this kind of content into a stringent museum space," Guerrero said, "that's so Dada."
McCreanor said that before the exhibition, she hadn't thought to take her videos seriously. (She still doesn't, really: the goal, she said, remains "to crack people up.") But they're underpinned by serious dance technique, as well as training in theater, visual art and comedy.
Dance came first. Her mother put her in classes when she was 5, hoping they would help her overcome her shyness. A few years later, McCreanor and a friend concocted a jokey routine for the dance studio's talent competition. "We were bonking heads and doing slapstick stuff, just playtime," McCreanor said. The number proved so popular the studio began bringing it to local dance competitions. "We won every single one," McCreanor said. "And I've basically been making things like that ever since."
McCreanor found that she most admired dance artists who used movement as a form of wit: O'Connor, Bob Fosse. ("Fosse is absolutely comedy to me," she said. "His timing!") She also identified a kindred spirit in Mr. Bean, a k a Rowan Atkinson, whose wordless buffoonery is deceptively well choreographed.
As she grew up, she started performing in musicals and watching live comedy shows. In high school and college, she studied visual art. "I chose it specifically because I knew they'd let me get away with everything I wanted to do," she said. "I could dance, write, direct, perform, and it could all be labeled 'visual art."'
At 18, McCreanor left college to join a touring stage version of the film "How to Train Your Dragon." The tour brought her to Los Angeles, where she decided to stay -- with no plans, but plenty of curiosity about the entertainment world. "I've never really had a dream job, except to be performing somehow," she said.
Though she got an array of dance and music video gigs, television commercials were her bread and butter. She estimates that she's acted and danced in nearly 70 ads, including spots for Google, Apple, Jockey, Kohl's, Toyota, Honda and KFC.
McCreanor found a kind of freedom in the overtly transactional nature of advertising. "The whole game of it fascinates me," she said. "When you're in a commercial, you're very important, and yet you're also not at all important. Talent is so little of it. Ninety percent is just, you had the right hair color." She learned how to figure out what producers were looking for, become that person if she could, and not let it upset her if she couldn't.
But eventually she tired of being a cog, even if a well-paid one. In 2019 McCreanor tried out for the television series "So You Think You Can Dance," excited as much by the chance to choreograph her own audition solo as by the thought of reality-TV fame. Her gonzo "Boogie Wonderland" number -- think Napoleon Dynamite's dance performance, if Napoleon could actually dance -- was completely unlike the other auditioners' glossy routines. Though she didn't make it to the show's top 20, her choreography knocked the judges' socks off. After it was posted online, it delighted a big chunk of the internet, too.
"That was my first experience going viral, which was thrilling because that solo was all me," McCreanor said. "It was a huge motivator for me to get back to sharing my own ideas instead of working other peoples' jobs."
Her epiphany was well-timed. A few months later, Covid's arrival wiped out conventional performance opportunities, and McCreanor suddenly had lots of time to play on social media. Though she wasn't interested in the dance challenges then sweeping TikTok -- "I knew early on that I didn't just want to do other peoples' trends," she said -- she was keen to figure out what else made the app tick.
She hadn't forgotten the lessons she'd learned from advertising. Malia Baker, a dancer and friend of McCreanor's, said McCreanor has a natural gift for targeting an audience. "She knows what ideas are going to hook people, but somehow it never feels calculated," Baker said.
Many of McCreanor's posts feature ingenious imitations of other, already-viral videos. The hydraulic press series, in which she mimics strangely mesmerizing clips of unlikely objects being squashed, has been a huge TikTok hit. Goofy animals, one of the internet's favorite subjects, are other frequent duet partners. Baker often pops up in McCreanor's "ChickTok" series, which copies the amusingly dance-like bobs and bounces of a very popular flock of Italian chickens.
The videos are fun partly because they're unpolished, with whatever is in the closet costumes and plenty of bloopers. "It's all very high school drama department D.I.Y.," McCreanor said. But her obvious skills as a performer bring a degree of integrity to the silliness, said Sophie Prince, a curator at the National Gallery of Victoria.
"It's held up by what you can just tell is 10,000 hours of experience," Prince said. When McCreanor makes her body into various logos for her blithely ridiculous "logo performance art" series, for example, the angle of her Nike check mark is precisely right. And her videos are in some ways museum friendly. Their clean aesthetic -- simple white backgrounds, straight-on camera angles -- lends them a pop-art gloss.
McCreanor said her "mind was blown" by the National Gallery of Victoria exhibition. As a visual arts student, she'd hoped for just that kind of recognition. It's both funny and slightly subversive that she got there by making internet memes. "She didn't realize that the tools that she was using might be perceivable and appreciated by the art world," Prince said.
On the other hand, given the scale of McCreanor's online popularity -- her videos have collectively earned more than a billion views -- the museum might have gotten the better end of the deal.
"She didn't need us," Prince said. "We're lucky to have shown her work."
Like the museum scene, the professional dance scene can get mired in its own earnestness. Baker thinks many dance artists would be happier if they followed McCreanor's example, using humor to pop the balloon of self-importance.
"Dancers tend to make themselves miserable because the stakes get so high, and they're so critical of themselves," she said. "Not taking herself seriously has really become Smac's superpower."
There's an innocence to that lack of self-seriousness, too. McCreanor's videos are aimed at a general audience, but her National Gallery of Victoria exhibit pulled in children like a magnet. "It's that Mr. Bean thing," McCreanor said. "There are no words, it's just a body, and so it's global -- everyone understands, everybody gets the joke." She envisions herself moving into children's entertainment.
Whatever the audience, McCreanor's work is going to be physical, and it's going to be funny.
"I'm clearly biased," she said, "but I just think dance is way better if it has humor in it."

Full text: Technology promises cost savings, but it turns out the dining experience is all about feelings.
On a recent Thursday afternoon at a Denny's in Long Beach, Calif., a four-foot-tall robot glided toward Diane Deconnick's table. Its three tiered trays could have hauled a feast, but they were empty except for a bowl of soup and a fried chicken salad.
As the machine rolled to a stop, a scrolling digital display announced, "FOOD IS HERE."
"It talks!" Ms. Deconnick said. A Denny's regular, she had been curious about the robot since it appeared a few weeks earlier. This was her first time being served by it.
Or partly served by it. A waiter had followed the robot. He took the food off the tray and put it on the table. "What's your name, robot?" Ms. Deconnick asked. "Lily," the server answered. He'd named it himself.
Ms. Deconnick, who planned on tipping her usual 20 percent, said, "I like Lily. She's a good worker."
For a decade, the promised era of robo-flipped burgers and automated baristas has always been just around the corner. But automation in restaurants, at least in the United States, remains a novelty. That is not because the robots and A.I. assistants can't hack it. By and large, the technology is there, and in some cases has been for years.
As labor costs rise and robots grow more sophisticated, the cold economic case for automation may become irresistible. But in the meantime, our soft, irrational human emotions -- how we react to these robot assistants -- will play a decisive role in how much and how quickly they start to run our restaurants. Even in a world of ghost kitchens, QR codes and contactless delivery, restaurants are still in many ways about feelings.
Michael Giebelhausen, a professor at the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business at Clemson University who studies the intersection of technology and hospitality, explained, "We should be thinking about not what jobs robots will take, but what jobs consumers will allow robots to do."
So far, and perhaps surprisingly, much of the automation currently being rolled out in the United States is on the human-facing, service side -- robotic bussers, A.I.-powered drive-throughs and the ever-proliferating touch screens.
But people come to restaurants to feel connected to other humans. They want to encounter people, not a chatbot, kiosk or mechanical arm. So successfully integrating robots is more than just an engineering challenge.
Professor Giebelhausen has found, for example, that consumers prefer human chefs to robot ones, in part because they believe that humans cook with love. In a paper currently under review, he and his co-authors found that if consumers had a friendly text chat with the robot, that preference faded.
"The crux is, if you feel the robot loves you," he said, "you allow the robot to cook with love."
Human emotions are decisive for restaurant employees as well, though in their case, it's less about feeling the love than assuaging the fears. An observational study conducted in Central Florida found that if restaurant management had consulted workers before bringing in a robot, they used it more effectively. At restaurants where a robot simply appeared one day with no employee input, workers were more likely to feel frustrated.
Mindy Shoss, an organizational psychology professor at the University of Central Florida who worked on the study, said that automation can make workers anxious about losing their jobs, or even their entire occupation. "Given popular discussions about tech replacing workers, it is a common concern, especially when the organization isn't clear on why the tech is brought in."
One reason they can be brought in is to do the heavy lifting.
Juan Higueros is the chief operating officer and co-founder of Bear Robotics, an American robotics company which participated in the U.C.F. study, and whose robot was gliding around the Long Beach Denny's. He said the co-founders of Bear used their previous experience as restaurant owners to design service robots. Servers were walking and carrying way too much, and some trays on wheels could help.
Mr. Higueros said Bear's data show robots carrying thousands of pounds of food on behalf of human servers and runners. "Operators say, wow, my staff doesn't have to do that anymore," he said. "Robots play really well when doing mundane things people don't want to do anyway."
Of course, the replacement fears are not baseless. Peter Kim, the chief technology officer of Navia, a service robot company, said he has seen an uptick in interest in California since the $ 20 minimum wage for major chain restaurants went into effect in April.
With robots, he said, "You don't have to worry about sick days. They're available 24/7 and 365, you don't have to worry about weather or traffic -- they just work."
Bear Robotics also chose to focus on dining-room robots because they offered a clear solution. The kitchen was much more complicated.
"In our own restaurant, we had four different languages being spoken. People are crowded trying to get everything done, rushing to get orders out and food on time to customers -- back-of-the-house is a battleground," Mr. Higueros said.
Gennadiy Goldenshteyn, the founder and managing partner of Dinemic Ventures and previously the head of global engineering at Yum! Brands, a conglomerate that includes Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, said developing hardware for kitchen automation takes years, and faces logistical challenges like worker safety and skeptical franchisees. As a result, even as chain restaurants look outwardly more futuristic, their kitchens work largely as they have for decades.
"It's kind of like we made a self-driving car out of a Model T," he said.
Drive-through ordering using A.I. was deployed by several large chains last year, though it showed mixed results and has been largely shelved for the moment. But recently, at a Rally's in Orange County, A.I. was still in place. The program understood an order for chicken fingers clearly, though it didn't respond to follow-up questions.
"It's a little bit of help, more help than before," said Alondra Villegas, the shift manager. But Ms. Villegas said customers were split about "half and half" on whether they liked the assistant. "She's funny -- sometimes she doesn't answer customers, and customers get mad at her."
Mr. Goldenshteyn believes that all of the order-taking automation, including kiosks and A.I., will eventually be superseded by a familiar bit of hardware that consumers already have a strong emotional attachment to: the smartphone. Most major chains already have apps that allow customers to place phone orders with fairly little friction.
And while human chefs excel at creating new dishes, he said automated cooking is the future, whether or not consumers believe that robots can cook with love.
"Pepperoni doesn't care if it was put there by a human hand or by machine," he said.
Whether in the drive-through line, the dining room or the kitchen, the key may be to stop designing robots that merely replicate how humans work.
Darian Ahler, a food tech consultant, said that a common mistake is to create a humanoid robot that performs a task that's easy for a human to do -- an arm making a latte, for instance.
If consumers prefer human cooks, and cooks worry about losing their human jobs, making a too-human robot may backfire. Instead, Mr. Ahler believes that automation "needs to act like a toaster."
He helped develop the Autocado, an avocado-processing machine that is now being adopted by Chipotle. A waist-high metal box with a chute for cooks to dump in avocados, it does the tedious work of peeling, halving and pitting. "People don't see this as taking jobs," Mr. Ahler said. "They see it as assisting."
Even though most restaurant kitchens work much as they have for decades, the fully automated restaurant, especially one focused on making a single type of dish, is closer to science fact than science fiction.
Benson Tsai, the chief executive and co-creator of Stellar Pizza, a fully automated pizza truck, said he was inspired by frozen pizza factories. "Walking into the grocery store, everything there is made by robots," he said. "You can watch YouTube videos of pizzas being made by the thousands on conveyor belts. It's a beautiful thing."
A veteran of the electric vehicle industry and SpaceX, Mr. Tsai said his interest in automating restaurants began when he saw food costs going up. "If people could pay $ 2 to $ 5 less for their food, that's much more beneficial than the few jobs we might be removing," he said.
Operating in the Los Angeles area, the Stellar truck turned a profit selling 12-inch pizzas for about $ 10, Mr. Tsai said. In March, the company was acquired by the Korean conglomerate Hanwha Food Tech. The truck is no longer in use, but Hanwha plans to open full-service restaurants in Los Angeles.
Part of the magic, Mr. Tsai said, was hiding the robots from customers. "I'm a firm believer that automation should be felt and not seen. I want them to feel it in their wallet and taste the higher quality of ingredients."
The truck did employ one human, however: someone to hand the pizza to the customer. Mr. Tsai pointed out: "Humans still do one thing very well, and that's smiling."

LONG BEACH, Calif. — On a recent Thursday afternoon at a Denny’s in Long Beach, California, a 4-foot-tall robot glided toward Diane Deconnick’s table. Its three tiered trays could have hauled a feast, but they were empty except for a bowl of soup and a fried chicken salad.
As the machine rolled to a stop, a scrolling digital display announced, “FOOD IS HERE.”

For Pregnant Women of Color, Myriad Factors Conspire to Kill: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The last day Byron Stribling spent with his wife, Harmony, was the Fourth of July in 2021. A great day, he always says.
The holiday fell on a Sunday. The congregation at their church in Belzoni, a small town in the Mississippi Delta, blessed the couple and prayed for a safe delivery for Ms. Ball-Stribling. She was eight months pregnant and scheduled to have a C-section five days later.
At a barbecue, the Striblings feasted on ribs, collard greens, potato salad and cornbread. But around midnight, Ms. Ball-Stribling threw up and said her chest hurt. "She wanted to lay down, but I told her, 'We need to go somewhere,"' Mr. Stribling, 32, recalled.
Ambulances in the Delta are unreliable, and the only hospital in Belzoni closed over a decade ago. So they piled into his car and sped toward Yazoo City, Miss., the closest town with an emergency room, about 30 miles away.
On the way, Ms. Ball-Stribling had a seizure. Panicked, Mr. Stribling called 911. The dispatcher told Mr. Stribling to pull over and start CPR, so he slammed on the brakes and pumped her chest on the side of the road until an ambulance came. But he already knew he had lost her, there on the shoulder of Route 49-W.
What killed Harmony Ball-Stribling? The death certificate says the cause of death was complications of pre-eclampsia, a life-threatening blood pressure disorder that can develop during pregnancy, exacerbated by hypertension and hardening of the arteries. But that's not the whole story.
Because even though Ms. Ball-Stribling was just 30, married and had health insurance, the odds were against her: She was a Black woman in America, where pregnant women of color die at almost three times the rate of pregnant white women.
She lived in a rural health care "desert," a county with no obstetrician or certified nurse midwife and no hospital that delivered babies -- in a state with the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the country, and the lowest life expectancy.
Her story is a case study of how powerful social, economic and environmental forces conspire against mothers of color in the United States, undermining their health even when they have access to medical care.
Researchers have become increasingly aware of the importance of these so-called social determinants of health. Well-being is inextricably linked to life circumstances -- like living in safe neighborhoods with good schools and easy access to healthy food -- and it is powerfully diminished when everyday life is buffeted by crime, pollution and racism.
"How you live, where you live and what you eat actually affect the DNA and affect genetic expression," said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. "There are actual biological changes that people go through based on their social determinants."
The American Heart Association, taking all these factors into account, has modified the calculator that doctors use to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease, reserving space in the formula for a patient's ZIP code as a proxy for social determinants.
At hospitals that treat low-income and minority patients, physicians report spending time making sure that patients have roofs over their heads when they go home and that their utilities aren't cut off. Some hospitals have started food pantries so their staff members can write food "prescriptions."
Researchers have identified race as a social determinant of health, finding that simply being a member of a minority group puts pregnant women at higher risk.
"It's not race itself that has an impact," said Maria B. Ospina, a clinical epidemiologist and an associate professor at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. "I cannot emphasize that enough. It is the experiences of racism and segregation that have affected every single aspect of African American women's lives."
"Pregnant women are always blamed," she added. "We need to stop individualizing risk without paying attention to what we collectively do to have these things happen."
The Striblings' hometown lies in the heart of the "Stroke Belt," a region stretching from Louisiana to Virginia that is plagued by high rates of diseases linked to obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. Dollar stores, which are plentiful in the Delta, stock sugary drinks, pasta, candy and canned foods that are high in salt.
There's only one full-service supermarket in Belzoni. The best bargains there are giant slabs of pork ribs, which sell for about $ 3 a pound, and jumbo bags of frozen fries.
Belzoni has a playground and ball fields, but no real park, no Y.M.C.A. and no public swimming pool. The small hospital in town closed in 2013. On a recent visit, I asked Mr. Stribling if we could meet outside on a mild day, perhaps by the Yazoo River, which meanders alongside the town.
"Oh, Miss Roni," he said, in a tone that combined resignation with a touch of exasperation about my naïveté. "This is Mississippi. There's no park here. There's no river trail. It's the Mississippi Delta."
Repeating Cycles
Ms. Ball-Stribling always stood out in a crowd. Her older sister, Cherrell Ball-Banks, remembers her sibling as warm and gregarious, with a voice like a nightingale's and an intense energy, someone who was "always lovin' on you."
"We're all firecrackers," Ms. Ball-Banks said of her family. "But Harmony, she was a full-fledged firecracker."
"She was the one who outshined all of us," she added. "She was never in the background. When Harmony walked in the door, you knew she was there."
Their mother, Shenelle Ball, was a teenager when she and her boyfriend, Renwick Baymon Sr., had the two girls. Money was tight, but no one in the small, predominantly Black town had much, Ms. Ball said in an interview.
The income per capita is under $ 20,000 in Belzoni, and one-third of the town's population live in poverty, triple the national rate.
In an interview, Mr. Baymon said that his mother had him when she was 14, a year after having his older brother at 13. "You have kids when you're young in Belzoni because there is nothing do to," said Mr. Baymon, who left the town as soon as he could. "It's a repeating cycle."
The cycle repeated in the next generation. Ms. Ball-Banks was 13 when she had her first child, and Ms. Ball-Stribling had a baby when she was 16.
The girls' mother relocated the family to Clarksville, Tenn., after marrying a man who was in the military. But the girls missed Belzoni and insisted on going back for middle school and high school. They loved the tight-knit church and community. They knew everyone in town, and everyone knew them.
Ms. Ball-Stribling was always on the honor roll at school, and she kept busy as a singer in the church choir and a cheerleader and a majorette in the school's marching band. She had a boyfriend, Arsenio Robinson.
In 2008, a blood test during an emergency room visit for pain showed that she was pregnant -- and pretty far along. Her son, Jadon, was born later that year, when Ms. Ball-Stribling was 16.
Increasingly, health researchers are inclined to see social determinants at work in stories like hers.
Teen pregnancy rates have plummeted throughout the United States, including in Mississippi. But the state continues to have the highest rates of teen births in the nation, almost double the country's average and six times that of the state with the lowest rate, New Hampshire.
Teen pregnancies are disruptive, and they limit young women's economic and educational options. But less widely known is that pregnancy is hard on a girl's developing body, placing both mothers and their babies at risk for health problems with lifelong repercussions.
Teen mothers have more stillbirths and are more likely to develop pregnancy-related blood pressure disorders like pre-eclampsia, as Ms. Ball-Stribling did. They are also more likely to have babies who are born prematurely and are small for their gestational age.
"Pregnancy can be a beast on the body," said Dr. Kimberly Sanford, an obstetrician who practiced in the Delta until 2022.
Yet Mississippi state law allows public schools to teach only abstinence-based sex education. It does not require the information to be medically accurate, and parents must opt in for their children to participate.
The advocacy organization Sex Ed for Social Change gives the state an F rating. The lack of comprehensive sex education is one reason there are so many new H.I.V. cases each year among Black teens and young adults in Mississippi, according to the organization.
The state also moved to outlaw almost all abortions, with few exceptions, just days after a Supreme Court decision in 2022 allowed it to do so.
Ms. Ball-Stribling stayed in high school and graduated, but the high blood pressure she developed during her pregnancy never went away. The medications she was prescribed had severe side effects, including headaches and fatigue. She found it difficult to control the condition.
When her relationship with Mr. Robinson fell apart, she started dating Byron Stribling. Her high blood pressure was a constant concern. Mr. Stribling was no stranger to the condition -- he has it himself. High blood pressure ran in both of their families, and both had lost relatives younger than 50 to heart attacks and strokes.
Mr. Stribling, who works at his family's funeral home, sees the results of chronic conditions like hypertension, high cholesterol and obesity in his profession as an undertaker.
"You start embalming, and the embalming fluid pushes blood out of the veins, and you can see the cholesterol," he said. "You can tell, after you've been doing it so long, 'That was a heart attack, we've got a blockage here."'
Obesity is so common in the community, he said, that "it's nothing for us to get a call about someone who's dead who's 450 pounds, who's stuck in a back room, and we have to get them out."
Unhealthy food habits are pervasive, he added: "People get up in the morning and eat fried chicken and Coca-Cola at 6 in the morning, before they go to work -- not coffee and a yogurt parfait and an apple."
'A Bolt From the Blue'
Ms. Ball-Stribling was a bit overweight but not obese, which is linked to high blood pressure. Still, early in their relationship, the condition proved stubborn, relentless. It can damage the body without causing overt symptoms. When her blood pressure was out of control, she felt fine.
"It was the most peculiar thing," Mr. Stribling said. "When her pressure was brought down with the medication, that's when she had symptoms."
She was struggling to make ends meet, juggling college classes with shifts at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Mr. Stribling had a scholarship to attend music school in Jackson, Miss., but he came home on weekends and helped out.
He graduated in June 2015 and returned to Belzoni, and the two married a month later.
When Ms. Ball-Stribling's son, Jadon, was about 9, his father, Mr. Robinson, was arrested and charged as an "accessory after the fact" to a gang-related murder. Prosecutors said he had thrown his car keys to the suspect so the man could flee. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, which he is still serving.
As it turned out, the murder victim was related to Ms. Ball-Stribling. He was a cousin of Mr. Baymon, whose brother had also died violently: He was a bystander at a gas station who was killed after a fight broke out in a nearby club and spilled outside.
"It's like living in Beirut," Mr. Baymon said of Belzoni. "Big-city stuff happens in that small town, but there's no medical care. You can bleed out before someone gets there."
Mr. Stribling took on the role of father to Jadon after Mr. Robinson was sent away. But he and Ms. Ball-Stribling had trouble conceiving another child, and they decided to go to Dallas for fertility treatment.
Ms. Ball-Stribling conceived after two rounds of in vitro fertilization, and she continued prenatal care with doctors at the high-risk pregnancy care clinic of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, about an hourlong drive from Belzoni.
But she was not doing well: Her blood pressure was often out of control, and she had splitting headaches, Mr. Stribling said.
In May 2021, when she was about six months pregnant, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, a serious pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure and organ damage and can be fatal.
Though pre-eclampsia is rare, affecting only 5 percent to 8 percent of pregnant women, half of all women who start pregnancy with uncontrolled hypertension will develop it. It also is one of several complications, including stroke, that are more common among women who undergo fertility treatment.
How women with pre-eclampsia fare varies by region. Women in the South have the greatest incidence of pregnancy complications; those in the Northeast have the lowest.
Ms. Ball-Stribling was not a perfect patient. Her extended family was scheduled to go on vacation around the time she was hospitalized, and she didn't want to miss out. After a few days of observation, she signed herself out against medical advice.
"I didn't agree with it, but she insisted, and I didn't want to make matters worse," Mr. Stribling said.
In the weeks that followed, Ms. Ball-Stribling's blood pressure stabilized. Her mother shared the record of blood pressure readings on her daughter's phone: "May 24: 134/93. May 27: 115/85. June 7: 131/91."
The Striblings saw doctors in Jackson twice a week, and "everything was looking good," Mr. Stribling said. "Those last few visits, it was all smiles and giggles."
But women with pre-eclampsia can experience sudden seizures or strokes, which are signs of a life-threatening complication called eclampsia. The term derives from the Greek word for "lightning" or "bolt from the blue."
Before dawn on July 5, 2021, Ms. Ball-Stribling died. A hospital might have been able to save the fetus, a girl the couple planned to name Harper, but she died, too, on the side of the road.
Mr. Stribling said he had no way of explaining the loss, but he said he was a man of faith.
"I don't know why, I don't understand it -- it hurts," he said. "But none of us know when our expiration date is. It tells you that in the Bible. None of us know, so be ready."
Since then, both Mr. Stribling and his mother-in-law, Ms. Ball, have pressed the state to provide more health services in rural areas in Mississippi, where at least five hospitals have closed since 2015, several have stopped delivering babies in recent years, and 35 -- almost half of the state's rural hospitals -- are at risk of closing.
Nationally, more than 30 percent of all rural hospitals are at risk of shutting down.
Mississippi is among 11 states that have not expanded Medicaid to cover all low-income residents, which means that more hospital patients and women giving birth are uninsured, pushing even more hospitals to the brink.
Hospital administrators often close labor and delivery units as a first cost-cutting measure because they are so expensive to staff around the clock.
"They always say there's no money for hospitals," Ms. Ball said. "But if we just had a stand-alone emergency care center, even with what happened to Harmony, maybe the baby could have survived."
Indeed, the most recent report of the Mississippi Mortality Review Committee, which examined maternal deaths in the state during or within one year of pregnancy, concluded that a vast majority were preventable.
In an effort to improve birthing outcomes and infant health, Mississippi last year started a program that sends nurses into the homes of hundreds of at-risk moms and babies in rural areas.
None of the providers who cared for Ms. Ball-Stribling during her pregnancy ever reached out to Mr. Stribling after she died, he said. They didn't call to find out what went wrong, and they didn't call to express their condolences.
Annie Oeth, a spokeswoman for the University of Mississippi Medical Center, declined repeated requests for comment. She would not say whether the medical center had examined Ms. Ball-Stribling's case as part of a standard quality-assurance review.
In August 2021, Harmony Ball-Stribling was awarded her bachelor's degree in education, which she had been working toward for years through an online university. The diploma came in the mail after she died, her mother said.
Mr. Stribling bought a house and became guardian to Jadon, now a high school sophomore. Mr. Stribling is still paying off the debt incurred for the infertility services the couple received.
At family get-togethers, Ms. Ball-Stribling's absence is palpable.
"When my father's children all get together, we look around and ask, 'Where's that sparkle? That smile, that face, that sunshine?"' her sister said. "The light is gone." Harmony Ball-Stribling's cause of death was pre-eclampsia. That wasn't the whole story.

BELZONI, Miss. — The last day Byron Stribling spent with his wife, Harmony, was the Fourth of July in 2021.
The holiday fell on a Sunday. The congregation at their church in Belzoni, a small town in the Mississippi Delta, blessed the couple and prayed for a safe delivery for Ball-Stribling. She was eight months pregnant and scheduled to have a cesarean section five days later.
But around midnight that night, Ball-Stribling threw up and said her chest hurt. “She wanted to lay down, but I told her, ‘We need to go somewhere,’” recalled Stribling, 32.
Ambulances in the Delta are unreliable, and the only hospital in Belzoni closed over a decade ago. So they piled into his car and sped toward Yazoo City, Mississippi, the closest town with an emergency room, about 30 miles away.
On the way, Ball-Stribling had a seizure. Panicked, Stribling called 911. The dispatcher told Stribling to start CPR, so he slammed on the brakes and pumped her chest on the side of the road until an ambulance came. But he already knew he had lost her.
What killed Harmony Ball-Stribling? The death certificate says the cause was complications of preeclampsia, a life-threatening blood pressure disorder that can develop during pregnancy. But that’s not the whole story.
Because even though Ball-Stribling was just 30, the odds were against her: She was a Black woman in America, where pregnant women of color die at almost three times the rate of pregnant white women.
She lived in a rural health care “desert,” a county with no obstetrician or certified nurse midwife and no hospital that delivered babies — in a state with the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the country.
Her story is a case study of how powerful social, economic and environmental forces conspire against mothers of color in the United States, undermining their health even when they have access to medical care.
Researchers have become increasingly aware of the importance of these so-called social determinants of health. Well-being is inextricably linked to life circumstances — like living in safe neighborhoods with good schools and easy access to healthy food — and it is powerfully diminished when everyday life is buffeted by crime, pollution and racism.
“How you live, where you live and what you eat actually affect the DNA and affect genetic expression,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine.
The American Heart Association, taking all these factors into account, has modified the calculator that doctors use to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease, reserving space in the formula for a patient’s ZIP code as a proxy for social determinants.
Ball-Stribling always stood out in a crowd. Her older sister, Cherrell Ball-Banks, remembers her sibling as warm and gregarious, with a voice like a nightingale’s and an intense energy, someone who was “always lovin’ on you.”
“We’re all firecrackers,” Ball-Banks said of her family. “But Harmony, she was a full-fledged firecracker.”
In 2008, a blood test during an ER visit for pain showed that Ball-Stribling was pregnant. Her son, Jadon, was born later that year, when she was 16. Ball-Stribling stayed in high school and graduated, but the high blood pressure she developed during her pregnancy never went away. The medications she was prescribed had severe side effects, including headaches and fatigue.

WK Kellogg to Shut Down Cereal Plant in Nebraska
WK Kellogg plans to shut down its plant in Omaha by the end of 2026 under a reorganization that will also reduce the cereal maker's headcount by more than 17 percent, it said on Tuesday, as it streamlines its production.
The company projected 2024 adjusted net sales to come in at the lower end of its prior forecast range of 1 percent growth to 1 percent decline. It also posted in-line net sales of $ 672 million for the second quarter.
WK Kellogg is the North American cereal business of the packaged food giant Kellogg. The reorganization, approved by the board on July 31, is expected to result in cumulative restructuring pretax charges of between $ 230 million and $ 270 million. Under the plan, the Froot Loops maker will consolidate its manufacturing network beginning with a phased reduction in production at the Nebraska plant and scaling back production at its Memphis facility, starting in late 2025.

Taco Bell Sustains Profit
For Yum Amid Sales Hit
Yum Brands beat expectations for second-quarter profit on Tuesday as strength in the Taco Bell business and cost controls helped offset a sales hit from weak demand at KFC and boycotts related to the Middle East conflict.
Like its peers in the fast-food industry, Yum has been investing in loyalty programs and refreshing its menus in an attempt to appeal to budget-conscious consumers, but stiff competition for value meals and promotions has dogged its KFC business in the U.S. this year.
Company executives said on a post-earnings call that the impact from boycotts related to the Middle East conflict have surfaced in "several other markets" beyond Malaysia, Indonesia and the Middle East.
"Significant volatility remains, and we recognize sales are some markets are not where we want them to be," said the chief executive, David Gibbs. Reuters
TRANSPORTATION
Uber's Revenue Growth Beats Wall Street Forecast
Uber's second-quarter results on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates on the back of steady demand for its ride-sharing and food-delivery services.
"Mobility had a standout second quarter ... growth was consistent across use cases and geographic strength was led by LatAm and APAC, in particular Brazil, Australia and India," Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said.
Trips by self-driving vehicles on Uber's platform were six times higher in the quarter, helped by partnerships with companies including Alphabet's Waymo for ride-share and food delivery, as well as start-up Waabi for freight services.
Uber's revenue rose 16 percent to $ 10.70 billion in the second quarter ending June, while gross bookings increased 19 percent to $ 39.95 billion. Analysts had expected $ 10.57 billion and $ 39.68 billion, respectively, according to LSEG data. Reuters

Punching Their Way Out of Poverty: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Boxing is a national passion in Thailand, offering a path to the Olympics and lucrative careers in a country with one of the world's widest income divides.
She was boxing for money. Even at 13 years old, she knew that.
Why else, said Janjaem Suwannapheng, would she commit to a sport in which a boy smashed her nose in, back when she was shorter than the stalks of rice in the fields near home?
"Anyone who becomes a boxer does it because they come from a poor background," she said. "It hurts, it's tiring, it's exhausting."
Of course, Janjaem is really good at boxing. She was the first girl to train at her local gym in Thailand's rural northeast. She loves the sport now, she said. At last year's world championships, she won a silver medal in her welterweight division (66 kg, about 145 pounds). At the Paris Olympics, she is into the round of 16 with a bye.
Even if she goes no further, Janjaem said, boxing has already saved her. Now 24, she has bought land and gold for her parents and a pickup truck for herself. She scored an athletic scholarship to a university. Her older brother, by contrast, left school at 15 to work with their father, a truck driver.
Boxing is a national passion in Thailand, where the confluence of hardscrabble living and a fondness for illegal gambling -- on anything from cockfighting and buffalo racing to a fin-snapping standoff between Siamese fighting fish -- has made the sport tremendously lucrative. The local variety, muay Thai, or Thai boxing, relies on lightning strikes with legs, knees, elbows and fists first honed by ancient warriors dedicated to the "way of the eight limbs."
Muay Thai boxers wear no protective gear on their heads. In 2018, a 13-year-old fighter died of a brain hemorrhage after he was knocked out in a bout. Legislators talked about tightening regulations for minors. Not much happened. The sport continues to gird the illegal gambling economy.
In a country with the highest income inequality in East Asia and the Pacific, according to the World Bank, boxing allows young people to vault fast from subsistence farming to the climate-controlled privilege of Bangkok. By winning bouts, Thai prisoners can earn early release, as one flyweight boxer who competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics did after his sentence for robbery was commuted.
Thailand's impoverished northeast, known as Isaan, cultivates the majority of the country's boxers. The region's labor force is scattered around the country and the world because there aren't enough jobs back home. Last October, about two dozen Isaan workers were kidnapped from Israeli farms near Gaza; more than 40 Thai farmhands have been killed by Hamas.
"From working in the fields, from working in the sun, we get the fighting spirit," said Thananya Somnuek, who started boxing as a young teenager in Isaan.
Thananya won a national championship at 16 and later a gold medal at the Youth Olympic Games. Her nickname in Thai is Butter, because her mother had a premonition that her daughter would one day go to a foreign country where people ate such foreign ingredients. One of Thananya's boxing squad teammates, another Isaan native, is nicknamed Cream. Both Butter and Cream made it to Paris.
Officially, children in Thailand can enter the muay Thai ring at age 10. If they are healthy, they can box for money every 21 days. But in Isaan, locals say, standards are more lax. As long as farmhands aren't needed for the harvest, children can fight every 10 days.
"The strict rules are made by air-conditioned men sitting in air-conditioned rooms," said Suthep Saengngoen, as he sat in his family's sweltering muay Thai gym, rubbing his grandson's body with a cooling mentholated liniment. His six sons all fought, too.
The family is from Isaan, but the gym is in the outskirts of Bangkok, amid industrial warehouses and scraggly fruit farms. Boxing purses in the Thai capital are at least triple those back home.
Suthep's grandson, Chaichana Saengngoen, was named a muay Thai rookie of the year in 2023. He's now 16 and, in addition to his earnings in the ring, receives $ 1,300 in endorsements every month.
"I started boxing because my grandfather forced me to," Chaichana said. He was 7 when he began.
"I do like it now," he added.
The children at the gym train from five to seven in the morning, before going to school. Then they return for afternoon practice until the mosquitoes start swarming at dusk. That's not counting 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of running twice a day to build stamina. By the end of the day, their young arms shiver from smacking the bag -- and each other -- hundreds of times. Hundreds of roundhouse kicks leave their legs quaking, too. Still, they return for more.
Nutthapol Anuphap, 10, has been boxing since he was 3, he said. At 5 years old, he appeared on a local TV talent show. One of his muay Thai videos has nearly 2 million views. His nickname is Fist.
"I'm going to be rich," he said.
At the Chaiya District Prison in southern Thailand, in a concrete yard flanked by razor wire, a group of inmates heaved, kicked and punched in the 97-degree heat. One lifted a cement-filled bucket with his teeth, strengthening his jaw and neck with each 22-pound (10 kilogram) rep.
Out of the more than 900 inmates at Chaiya, 15 men and five women have qualified for a prison muay Thai program, one of 10 in the country. They train for eight hours a day and receive extra rations of eggs, meat and milk.
"Muay Thai training gives the prisoners resilience," said Sathika Samsri, the superintendent of Chaiya. "We want to build them into professional boxers or trainers who will not return to prison."
The fighters can keep their prize money, and prison officials allow them occasional perks such as KFC spicy chicken wings, a local favorite. Successful bouts at local stadiums, which they attend with prison officials in tow, count as good behavior in parole hearings.
Jomyud Sowangchompu, 21, was sentenced to four years in prison for drug dealing and possession. He left school in sixth grade and could only find a job making less than $ 15 a week during the fruit harvesting season, he said. In a town match in June, he lost in the first round. Still, he earned $ 55 for fighting, enough to pay for months of prison necessities: soap, toothpaste, laundry detergent, haircuts.
"I don't have to ask my parents for money," he said. "It makes me feel like a better man."
None of the prison boxers said they have any interest in watching the Paris Olympics, even if the wardens were to allow them screen time At the Bangkok muay Thai gym, the children and coaches seemed mystified by the Olympic boxing rule limiting participation to amateurs.
"What's the point of boxing if you can't make lots of money?" said Suthep, the gym family patriarch.
Besides, he said, without the kicks, knees and elbows of muay Thai, Olympic boxing seemed like only half a sport.
Demonstrations of muay Thai are taking place on the sidelines of the Paris Games. But the sport, while gaining in popularity overseas, has nowhere near the profile of international boxing. And for all the money to be made -- and gambled -- in muay Thai, the professional boxing circuit is far more developed. Many Olympic boxers retire and go pro.
Wijan Ponlid began training in muay Thai at age 9, then won flyweight gold at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. A parade of elephants greeted him upon his return, and he was handed a cushy job as a police officer. Today he's the coach of the Thai women's Olympic team. Among his duties: figuring out how to nourish the squad in Paris with their beloved shrimp and chili paste, an Isaan specialty.
"I switched to international boxing because with muay Thai, I got to a point where I was the world champion, but I wanted to be part of a national team with the flag on my chest," Wijan said.
For Thai women, international boxing offers even more opportunities.
Jutamas Jitpong, the daughter of rubber tappers, started in muay Thai at 9 years old. Within three years, she was a champion, but there were few girls of her caliber with whom to compete. Some muay Thai stadiums, governed by rules loosely affiliated with Buddhism, don't allow women to enter the ring, much less fight. In three years, she fought three times.
So Jutamas, now 26, switched to boxing. Although women's boxing became an Olympic sport in 2012, Thailand didn't send any athletes in the event until four years later.
Jutamas won a flyweight silver at the 2022 world championships and a bronze a year later. She made it to the round of 16 in Paris.
"Maybe people thought, you're a woman, you really want to box?" Jutamas said. "I want to box. I want to win."

An Addiction Scourge That Won't Go Away: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Republican vice-presidential nominee has spoken often about drug-afflicted communities like the one he escaped. But those communities have tempered their expectations for his help.
Sitting in a KFC restaurant in the former coal-mining town of Pomeroy, Ohio, a few hours before JD Vance addressed the Republican National Convention, Curtis Ramsey, 18, recalled the first time he heard the Ohio senator's name.
It was last month, he said, in the Washington office of another Ohio Republican, Representative Jim Jordan.
Mr. Ramsey, who had never been to a big city or flown on an airplane before, was in the capital with two filmmakers seeking to draw attention to a new documentary, "Inheritance." The film features Mr. Ramsey and examines the plight of drug-ravaged Appalachian communities like his own.
When the filmmakers, Matt Moyer and his wife, Amy Toensing, explained to Mr. Jordan what their documentary was about, the congressman broke into a smile. "Sounds like the story of the next vice president of the United States!" Mr. Jordan said.
Recalling this encounter, Mr. Ramsey bit into his chicken sandwich and considered the supernova trajectory of the "Hillbilly Elegy" author against his own precarious life.
"He was lucky," Mr. Ramsey said of Mr. Vance, an Ohioan who spent time in his early years 165 miles southwest of Pomeroy in Jackson, Ky. "He got out."
Central to Mr. Vance's narrative as Donald J. Trump's 39-year-old running mate is that he broke free from the grinding poverty of Appalachian roots and his mother's drug addictions to become a corporal in the Marines, a Yale Law School graduate, a best-selling author and finally a political phenomenon.
In his acceptance speech, Mr. Vance vowed, "I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from."
The statement is unassailable if measured by Mr. Vance's public allusions to his upbringing. When the standard is addressing the complexities of drug-addicted families like Mr. Ramsey's, his devotion is more complicated.
Experts in the addiction field, both in Ohio and nationally, say that healing the wounds of drug-dependent communities is an expensive, unglamorous endeavor. The most notable champion for this issue in Congress, they say, is Representative Hal Rogers, a Republican who represents the district in Kentucky where Mr. Vance spent his childhood. Mr. Rogers has steered millions of dollars to related programs back home and has also established the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit, an annual national gathering to explore the opioid epidemic.
Mr. Vance's leadership has been comparatively modest thus far.
"It was a big moment for people who were in recovery having his mother stand up during the convention and be saluted," said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who served on the board of a nonprofit, now shut down, that Mr. Vance set up in 2016 to explore social challenges in Ohio. "But that's not the same thing as a comprehensive approach to the addiction crisis."
In 2017, a year after the publication of "Hillbilly Elegy," a political memoir, Mr. Vance told the conservative journalist Megyn Kelly, "The things that I care most about are the opioid crisis, about solving some of the issues that I write about in the book."
Years later in a campaign ad, the Senate candidate echoed that sentiment, saying: "This issue is personal. I nearly lost my mother to the poison coming across the border."
But in Mr. Vance's 19 months in the Senate, his talk and actions have been more pitched to partisan politics than to the tragic complexities he experienced firsthand. He has not introduced legislation targeted to drug-afflicted communities. Instead, he has frequently cited the spread of fentanyl as a data point in criticizing the Biden administration for failing to secure the border and curb China's malign influence.
Mr. Vance was a sponsor of a Republican bill to reclassify fentanyl as a Schedule I controlled substance. He was also an early sponsor of a bill to tax remittances out of the U.S. to foreign countries with the aim of curbing drug trafficking. Both bills have been stuck in committees for the past year.
Another bipartisan bill on which he was a sponsor, to combat fentanyl trafficking, was signed into law by President Biden in April.
Experts in the field say they are waiting for more from Mr. Vance. "I haven't seen a lot of what he's done on this, to be honest," said Marcia Lee Taylor, the former chief executive of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids and currently an advisory council member of National Fentanyl Awareness Day.
"I do give Senator Vance credit for talking about the issue in a personal way," she added. "And I would hope that someone who's had a front-row seat to this complicated problem would recognize that addressing only the supply side of the addiction crisis isn't sufficient."
Beyond the legislation, there is little mention of addiction on Mr. Vance's Senate website: Only a handful of his 248 statements to the media refer to drugs. One highlights his appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" last year to discuss fentanyl trafficking and a second describes his questioning of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent at a Senate hearing about China's role in the drug trade. A third recounts his visit to a new addiction treatment center.
That visit was in October to the town of Xenia, Ohio, to tour the Emerge Recovery and Trade Initiative, which received startup funding from the Biden administration's American Rescue Plan. The center offers not only treatment but also vocational pathways of the sort that eluded Mr. Vance's mother during her addiction struggles.
Emerge's director of philanthropy, Elaine Bonner, said in an interview that the encounter was a positive one and that she would welcome more help from Mr. Vance. She said she was unaware if he had offered to steer more federal funds to the program. "I'm hoping he can come back one day," she said.
Ohio stakeholders in the addiction crisis interviewed for this article have tempered their expectations about their native son's dedication to the matter. "I remain hopeful about Mr. Vance," said Robin Harris, who leads an Ohio agency, the Gallia-Jackson-Meigs Board of Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services, that provides treatment services to struggling communities.
Ms. Harris added that she had met Mr. Vance only once, after a panel discussion shortly after the publication of "Hillbilly Elegy." She recalled approaching him and asking what he envisioned as an effective method of drug prevention.
"And he said, 'How would I know?"' she said.
Mr. Vance's spokesman, William Martin, did not respond to a request for comment about the encounter.
But in an earlier statement, he characterized Mr. Vance's dedication to the issue as a high priority. "Whether it's working with treatment centers in Ohio to help addicts get clean or fighting to stop the flow of deadly drugs across the wide-open southern border," Mr. Martin said, "Senator Vance has spent years working on this issue, and he won't stop until the job is done."
Mr. Ramsey, who now lives in a trailer with friends near Pomeroy, said he would like to find his own path out of Mr. Vance's former world.
"The pursuit of happiness isn't even possible here," he said. Ticking off the steps with his fingers, he added: "It's the pursuit of survival. Then you just live. And after that, maybe there's happiness."
The documentary "Inheritance" amply documents this: The filmmakers followed Mr. Ramsey's family over an 11-year period, during which two of the principal characters died of drug overdoses. "My entire family, every single one of them, has been an addict at some point in their lives," Mr. Ramsey said.
He aspires to be more than just a member of his family. Finding the first steppingstone has not been easy. He dropped out of high school, to the disappointment of teachers and local social workers who have seen promise in him and hoped to help him rise above his grim circumstances.
"Kids like him are superhero-strong," said Angela Lariviere, an advocate for at-risk youth in Ohio who got to know Mr. Ramsey after seeing him in "Inheritance."
"But the trauma he's experienced is hard for people to appreciate," she said. "They say, 'Curtis, why can't you stay in school? Why can't you get a job and meet these goals?"'
Meigs County, in which Pomeroy sits, is a Republican stronghold. Mr. Trump won 76 percent of the vote in the 2020 election. Nearly all of Mr. Ramsey's family members are enthusiastic supporters of the former president.
An uncle of Mr. Ramsey, Johnny Lee Stumbo, said in an interview that he was cheered by the addition of Mr. Vance to the Republican ticket. "He's kind of like a hometown hero," said Mr. Stumbo, adding that he anticipated a Trump administration would stem the tide of illegal immigration. He did not see it as the White House's duty to address the impact of drugs on communities like his.
"I was an addict for years, just like the rest of them in my family," he said. "But I don't think politics has anything to do with your habits. Drugs is a personal choice."
Mr. Ramsey does not see things quite that way. "I mean, everyone knows what the problems here are," he said after finishing off his chicken sandwich. "But what I don't get is: If everyone knows, how can there still be a problem?"

Kenya Tax Rise Sets Off Chaos And Bloodshed: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: At least five people were killed in clashes with the police that erupted after lawmakers approved tax increases that critics said would drive up the cost of living for millions.
Thousands of demonstrators flooded the streets of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and some broke into Parliament and briefly set fire to the entrance on Tuesday, after lawmakers approved tax increases that critics said would drive up the cost of living for millions.
During the protests, the police fired tear gas and guns, plunging the capital into turmoil. At least five people were fatally shot and 31 others injured, according to Amnesty International and several prominent Kenyan civic organizations. The toll could not be immediately confirmed. The independent Kenya Human Rights Commission posted a video that showed police officers firing as protesters marched toward them.
As tear gas wafted through the streets, some protesters climbed through the windows of Parliament after lawmakers voted 195 to 106 in favor of the tax bill on Tuesday, with supporters saying it would raise revenue for education and other essential services.
Kenya's president, William Ruto, said he was deploying the military to crack down on what he called "treasonous events." In a televised address on Tuesday night, Mr. Ruto said the debate about the tax bill had been "hijacked by dangerous people who have caused us the kind of loss we have incurred as a nation today."
He vowed to punish those he said were responsible. "It is not in order or even conceivable that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives and the institutions established under our Constitution and expect to go scot-free," Mr. Ruto added.
The defense minister, Aden Duale, said the defense forces had been deployed to support the police, who he said were responding to the "security emergency" caused by the protests, which spread to other Kenyan cities.
The turmoil over the finance bill has shaken Kenya, an East African economic powerhouse of 54 million people that has long been an anchor of stability in a tumultuous region. Last week, at least one person was killed and 200 others injured in protests across the country, according to Amnesty International.
The protests convulsed Kenya just as 400 Kenyan police officers were arriving in Haiti as part of an international effort to try to restore order to that country, which has been ravaged by gang violence.
Mr. Ruto's government introduced the finance bill in May. The majority leader in Parliament, Kimani Ichung'wah, has said the bill is "crucial" to secure revenue for important government initiatives, including the construction of roads, the hiring of teachers and the funding of fertilizer subsidies for farmers.
Supporters also say the additional taxes will limit borrowing for a country facing a heavy debt burden.
"Without the passage of this bill, essential government operations would come to a standstill," he wrote on social media last week, adding that lawmakers had responded to criticism by removing unpopular taxes on bread and other items.
But many Kenyans roundly criticized the legislation, saying it still added punitive taxes on imported staples like eggs, onions and cooking oil, and raised taxes on a wide range of goods and services. Detractors also pointed to corruption and mismanagement of state funds, and faulted the opulent lifestyle and extravagant spending that they said had characterized the administration of Mr. Ruto, who has been in office since 2022.
The president now has two weeks to sign the legislation or send it back to Parliament for amendments.
Young Kenyans who have helped to fuel the protests said that their movement transcends class, tribe and race.
Some protesters have confronted officials at public gatherings and in houses of worship, and carried coffins to the offices of lawmakers who supported the legislation.
"The politicians have for too long underestimated our power, energy and passion," said Muchiri Mike, a 25-year-old content creator. "We are now asking questions and demanding answers, and they are surprised by this revolution happening at their doorsteps."
On Saturday, nightclubs across Kenya played the national anthem to rally against the finance bill, and on Sunday, church leaders and congregants voiced their opposition to the tax increases at religious services.
As the protests spread on Tuesday, demonstrators draped themselves in Kenyan flags, blew whistles and plastic trumpets, and chanted, "Ruto must go." In Nakuru, about 100 miles northwest of Nairobi, they blocked streets with burning tires and shouted, "Reject," a reference to a hashtag that has galvanized the anti-tax movement on social media.
Government officials have blamed unspecified foreign powers for stirring up the protests and dismissed the demonstrators as privileged youngsters who wield iPhones, arrive at demonstrations via Uber and then go eat at KFC.
Protesters rejected that description.
"It's not about how we get to the protests, but why we are here in the streets," said Anita Barasa, 19, whose TikTok videos about the demonstrations have gained a large following. "They are trying to take attention away from our demands, but we, the cool kids, are seeing that we don't have a bright future and want change."
Before the demonstration on Tuesday, several activists who are prominent critics of the bill were abducted, according to the Law Society of Kenya. The abductors' identities were not publicly known, but some were believed to be intelligence officers, according to the Law Society's president, Faith Odhiambo. Ms. Odhiambo later said that some of those abducted had been released.
Several protesters said they had received threats or intimidating phone calls in the days and hours leading up to the protests and were fearing for their lives.
Rights groups have long accused successive Kenyan governments of kidnapping critics and torturing them. The police did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but Kenya's chief justice, Martha Koome, condemned the abductions, calling them "a direct assault" on the rule of law.
In a joint statement, the ambassadors of 13 Western embassies in Kenya, including the United States, said they were "shocked" by the scenes outside the Kenyan Parliament and "deeply concerned" by allegations that some protesters had been abducted by security forces.
"We condemn the violence reported during protests in Nairobi and around Kenya," Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesman, said at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday. He added, "We urge restraint to restore order and provide space for dialogue."
The half sister of former President Barack Obama, Auma Obama, was among the protesters engulfed in tear gas on Tuesday, according to CNN footage. "Young Kenyans are demonstrating for their rights," Ms. Obama told a CNN reporter, before she began coughing and wincing.
"I can't even see anymore," she said.
Just after 6 p.m. in Nairobi, activists urged protesters to leave the city center. Public transportation services were not readily available, two protesters said, so they were walking home with others.
"Go home. While it's still safe," Boniface Mwangi, a Kenyan photographer and activist, wrote on social media. "The government will send goons to destroy, loot and blame peaceful protesters. They must listen to us. Spread the word for people to start walking home in groups. We shall be back."

As the protests spread Tuesday, demonstrators draped themselves in Kenyan flags, blew whistles and plastic trumpets, and chanted, “Ruto must go.” In Nakuru, about 100 miles northwest of Nairobi, they blocked streets with burning tires and shouted, “Reject,” a reference to a hashtag that has galvanized the anti-tax movement on social media.
Government officials have blamed unspecified foreign powers for stirring up the protests and dismissed the demonstrators as privileged youngsters who wield iPhones, arrive at demonstrations via Uber and then go eat at KFC.
Protesters rejected that description.
“It’s not about how we get to the protests, but why we are here in the streets,” said Anita Barasa, 19, whose TikTok videos about the demonstrations have gained a large following. “They are trying to take attention away from our demands, but we, the cool kids, are seeing that we don’t have a bright future and want change.”
Before the demonstration Tuesday, several activists who are prominent critics of the bill were abducted, according to the Law Society of Kenya. The abductors’ identities were not publicly known, but some were believed to be intelligence officers, according to Law Society President Faith Odhiambo. She later added that some of those abducted had been released.
Several protesters said they had received threats or intimidating phone calls in the days and hours leading up to the protests and were fearing for their lives.
Rights groups have long accused successive Kenyan governments of kidnapping critics and torturing them. Police did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but Kenya’s chief justice, Martha Koome, condemned the abductions, calling them “a direct assault” on the rule of law.
In a joint statement, the ambassadors of 13 Western embassies in Kenya, including the United States, said they were “shocked” by the scenes outside the Kenyan Parliament and “deeply concerned” by allegations that some protesters had been abducted by security forces.
“We condemn the violence reported during protests in Nairobi and around Kenya,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday. He added, “We urge restraint to restore order and provide space for dialogue.”
The half sister of former President Barack Obama, Auma Obama, was among the protesters engulfed in tear gas Tuesday, according to CNN footage. “Young Kenyans are demonstrating for their rights,” Obama told a CNN reporter, before she began coughing and wincing.
“I can’t even see anymore,” she said.
Just after 6 p.m. in Nairobi, activists urged protesters to leave the city center. Public transportation services were not readily available, two protesters said, so they were walking home with others.
“Go home. While it’s still safe,” Boniface Mwangi, a Kenyan photographer and activist, wrote on social media. “The government will send goons to destroy, loot and blame peaceful protesters. They must listen to us. Spread the word for people to start walking home in groups. We shall be back.”

New York's Ad Sector Still Lacks Diversity: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite corporate promises and hiring campaigns, the ad industry is among New York City's least diverse job sectors. It shows in the work, critics say.
Last summer, KFC ran advertisements in Canada featuring Black people eating fried chicken and licking their fingers, their faces reflected in unused silverware.
Critics called the images racist, but the campaign was not canceled. Instead, it was submitted this spring for a prestigious industry award in New York.
Nate Nichols, the founder and creative director of Palette Group, a creative agency in Brooklyn, was one of the few Black members of the panel of judges reviewing submissions.
"My genuine response is sadness," Mr. Nichols said. "It just means not enough of us have been able to make it into the room."
The ad did not win, and KFC Global did not respond to requests for comment. But the episode was emblematic of a multibillion-dollar advertising industry that in at least one way still resembles the "Mad Men" era of the 1960s -- namely, its lack of racial diversity.
That dearth, according to a new report, is keenly evident in New York City, the heart of the industry and also the largest advertising market in the United States. The disconnect could be costly at a time when shifts in media consumption favor younger, more diverse audiences.
There is also a need, as unemployment rates in New York City for people of color remain stubbornly high, for more diversity in an industry that pays above-average salaries, is expected to keep growing and requires relatively little formal training.
Of nearly 70,000 advertising employees in New York at the end of last year, less than 8 percent were Black, about 11 percent were Asian and under 15 percent were Latino, according to a report released on Monday by the Center for an Urban Future, a public policy research organization that seeks to increase economic mobility. Over 58 percent of employees were women, most of them white. The figures made advertising among the city's least diverse industries in the city,
Expressions of Black culture are everywhere in advertising, even when few people of color are working behind the scenes to create them, said Adrienne Lucas, the head of diversity, equity and inclusion at the One Club for Creativity, an industry trade group in New York.
"Our essence, our creativity is wanted, but we are not," she said.
In other ways, the business is rapidly changing.
By 2028, money spent on advertising in the United States could surpass $ 500 billion, a record, largely because of growth in digital media, said Paul Verna, a vice president of content for Emarketer, a market research firm.
Internet search ads, primarily on Google, have long been the biggest spending category. But social media, including sponsorships on TikTok and Instagram, is rapidly growing, and is attracting a younger demographic, Mr. Verna said.
Even the stretch of Madison Avenue that once defined the industry has lost some of its luster, as more firms move to trendy areas of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.
The shift has brands and ad agencies focused on younger, more diverse audiences, even as their board rooms remain largely white.
Splashy diversity efforts in the industry in 2021, in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent wave of racial justice protests, have stalled or reversed, according to a 2023 survey of over 100 agencies by the 4As, a national trade association.
White executives owned or ran roughly three out of every four agencies in 2021, the survey found. By the next year, the figure had jumped to nine in 10. A significant share of the industry is controlled by six major holding companies, including WPP and Publicis Groupe, that together own hundreds of agencies.
The report does not offer an explanation for the drop in nonwhite ad professionals, but found that 64 percent of Black employees had spent two years or less at their current agency, the shortest tenure of any racial or ethnic group.
Industry experts said the explanation was simple: a lack of career growth opportunities for people of color.
"There'll be a lot of fake 'we're doing something about it,' and as soon as the cycle dissipates, they go back to what they are -- companies run by white men," said Steve Stoute, the chief executive and founder of Translation, a Black-owned ad firm in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood.
People of color who do find a seat at creative meetings are often the lone voices of dissent in challenging culturally insensitive ideas, said Kai Deveraux Lawson, the head of culture and marketing at Valerie, a creative agency.
"Just because you have a Black or brown person in the room, and I personally have been in this situation, doesn't mean that person has the trust or the empowerment to influence anybody," she said.
Even when the views of people of color are heeded, the results are mixed, said Mr. Nichols, 36, of Palette Group.
"You're being looked at as the monolith for your community, and that's a very heavy burden to hold," he said.
Jody-Ann Crooks, 35, who works in health care advertising, grew up in Jamaica. She recalled a past job when an executive asked her if Black people use coal or gas grills.
"All eyes were on me and, first of all, 'What did this man just ask me?"' she said. "It's lonely and isolating."
Critics attribute some recent examples of racial insensitivity to a lack of representation.
In 2017, Pepsi pulled an ad that featured Kendall Jenner, a white woman, handing a can of soda to a police officer, amid cheerful protesters with signs that read "Join the conversation." Critics panned the ad for trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement and police violence.
But advertising's lack of diversity is also a work force problem, said Jonathan Bowles, the Center for an Urban Future's executive director.
"There are a lot of jobs that are growing in New York, but not many that have good wages," he said. He pointed to the explosive expansion of the home health care sector, which employs a large number of women of color but pays close to minimum wage.
Jobs that dwindled during the pandemic in sectors like retail have disproportionately affected people of color. The Black unemployment rate in New York City was nearly 8 percent in the year's first quarter, compared with 3.3 percent for white workers, according to the city's Economic Development Corporation.
That makes advertising an industry with big growth potential for people of color, Mr. Bowles said. In New York City, the median annual income in advertising is about $ 92,000, while the citywide private sector median income is $ 55,000, he said.
And job growth in the industry has been brisk. Despite a wave of layoffs during the pandemic, mostly in tech-related sectors, the advertising work force has grown nearly 50 percent in the past two decades, from 46,700 jobs in 2003 to 69,800 in 2023, far outpacing the private sector's 37 percent job growth in the same period.
"Most people don't know jobs like this exist," said Melvin DeBerry, 37, an art director for a large tech firm's ad department in Manhattan.
Last year, Mr. DeBerry was working at a steel mill in Memphis when he heard from a friend about the One School, a free program started in 2020 to help Black creatives build an advertising portfolio. A former aspiring musician, he was accepted to the four-month virtual program and attended classes two nights a week after work. He said his new salary tops $ 100,000, the most he has ever earned.
Hiring people from varied backgrounds is crucial to the industry's growth, said Joel Rodriguez, 36, an executive director with the creative firm Translation.
"It's not just in terms of skin color," he said. "It's diversity of thought,"
Some of his group's recent work includes a campaign for AT&T and its high-tech helmets for college football players who are deaf or hard of hearing, and a well-received short film for the headphone brand Beats by Dre. The film asked: "You love Black culture, but do you love me?"
His career could have gone differently. Mr. Rodriguez grew up in an apartment building in Flushing, Queens, where his father, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, was the superintendent. While studying marketing in college, Mr. Rodriguez worked as a janitor to pay his bills.
As graduation approached, he had no job prospects and considered applying to become the super at a new building near his home. But he had a cousin who was a chauffeur for Mr. Stoute of Translation. Mr. Rodriguez asked his cousin to slip his résumé to human resources.
The move earned him his first internship. Absent that opportunity, he said, he would have followed in his father's career footsteps.
"Without that exposure," Mr. Rodriguez said, "all we know is what we see."

Full text: Whether a food brand gets special protection hinges on complicated (and not always consistent) legal calculations. How good are you at spotting a real trademark?
America is saturated with food trademarks. The Cronut? Trademarked. Pop-Tarts? Trademarked. Even grapes that taste like cotton candy, and the mash-up of gai lan and broccoli called Broccolini are legally protected.
Yet the celebrity chef David Chang was widely criticized this spring for pressuring small manufacturers to stop using the term "chile crunch." His business holds the trademark for the spicy condiment, but many people wondered: How can a name common to so many cuisines be owned by one company?
The answers to that question and many more lie in the byzantine deliberations of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in Alexandria, Va. It has registered more than 200,000 food and agricultural trademarks, which means that the name or product -- the brand, essentially -- is unique enough that no one else is allowed to use it for a similar item. (Recipes can't be trademarked, but some can be ruled trade secrets, like the formula for Dr Pepper or KFC's 11 herbs and spices.)
The process of deciding what merits a trademark can be downright Talmudic, starting with the hierarchy of trademark types. The easiest to secure and protect are the completely made-up words that the office calls "fanciful," like Häagen-Dazs. Next are "arbitrary" names -- real words that have nothing to do with the products they identify, like Apple for computers. Harder-to-trademark categories include "suggestive" names, which contain a hint of what the product is, like SweeTarts, and plainly "descriptive" ones, like All-Bran.
There are precise legal requirements to meet, but also room for subjective interpretation. Public perception is the barometer. If a name seems confusing, misleading or too common, it won't get a trademark. "Our job is to figure out what the American consumer is thinking," said Amy Cotton, the deputy commissioner for trademark examination.
As a consumer, how good are you at gauging what deserves a trademark?
1 of 10
Is Gruyère trademarked?
Yes No
No.
The patent office decided two decades ago that Gruyère, the name given a cheese first produced in the Swiss district of La Gruyère in 1115, was common enough that it could be used to describe that type of cheese regardless of where it was made. Cheese makers in France and the Switzerland challenged the decision, but a federal appeals court ruled that American consumers already knew Gruyère as a style more than as a specific, regional specialty. (Parmesan makers enjoy similar freedom in the United States, but Parmigiano-Reggiano can be used only for cheese from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.)
2 of 10
Is Cuties a trademark?
Yes.
Both the small, peelable mandarins and a tofu-based frozen treat share the word Cuties in their trademarks. A trademark request will be denied if the name might confuse shoppers, but the trademark office determined that consumers were not likely to confuse this staple fruit of school lunches with Tofutti Cuties, a type of ice cream sandwich that had already been trademarked. It's the same principle that allows Dove soap and Dove chocolate to share a name.
3 of 10
Has cereal milk been trademarked?
Yes.
Although Christina Tosi, the founder of the Milk Bar dessert chain, wasn't the first person to discover that milk flavored with breakfast cereal was delicious. she was among the first to turn it into commercial products like soft-serve ice cream. Her cereal milk panna cotta debuted on the menu at Momofuku in New York City in 2006, and three years later she was granted the trademark for the term Cereal Milk for use with frozen confections. Descriptive names like that are harder to trademark, but Ms. Tosi claimed the name early on, which gave her a leg up. In 2020, she expanded the trademark to include her cookies, coffee drinks and powder mixes.
4 of 10
Is confetti cake a trademark?
No.
Although it became a signature confection at Milk Bar, this sprinkle-saturated style of cake is made in too many other kitchens, both private and commercial, to qualify as a distinctive name. (The trademark for Funfetti is owned by Hometown Food Company, which sells cake mixes.)
5 of 10
Are Idaho potatoes trademarked?
Yes.
You can grow a russet potato that looks and maybe even tastes like an Idaho potato, but unless you grow it in Idaho and have permission from the Idaho Potato Commission, you can't sell it as an Idaho potato.The commission, which began in 1937 as an advertising agency for Idaho produce, made a case that the soil and genetics of the Idaho russet were so unique they deserved special protection. It owns a number of potato-related marks aimed at protecting the quality and agricultural characteristics of its russets, including the Grown in Idaho seal. The commission guards the name as fiercely as the sweet onion growers in Georgia protect the term Vidalia, which can be used to market only onions grown with specific seeds in a 20-county region in the state.
6 of 10
How about In-N-Out's Double Double burger?
Yes.
The California burger chain's names for both its double-patty burger and its triple-patty burger (the Triple Triple) have been trademarked since the 1960s. In 2017, another chain, Smashburger, introduced a Triple Double burger, which used two patties and three slices of cheese. In-N-Out sued, arguing that the Smashburger offering would mislead consumers and even make them think the two companies were working together. In-N-Out also alleged that the Triple Double didn't really have double the beef, but simply divided the patty in its classic burger into two. The court ruled that Smashburger was guilty of false advertising but not trademark infringement. ("Smash burger," by the way, has become a common term for a cooking method, but since 2008 the chain has held trademarks for "smashburger," "smash burger" and "smash" for restaurant uses.)
7 of 10
Are Honeycrisp apples trademarked?
No.
The University of Minnesota, whose researchers bred the Honeycrisp, applied to trademark the name in the early 1990s but never completed the process, and the mark has been labeled "abandoned." Still, the inventors of the apple were granted a patent -- which protects an invention -- because they'd bred a new and distinct plant. The U.S. patent expired in 2008. The first apple to secure a trademark was the Pink Lady. The patent for that cultivar, called Cripps Pink and bred in 1973 by an Australian named John Cripps, is held by Brandt's Fruit Trees in Yakima, Wash. Commercial growers must pay a fee to produce and market the Pink Lady.
8 of 10
Is Moskovskaya vodka trademarked?
Yes.
The adjective means "of Moscow" in Russian. Spirits International, the company that applied for the mark in 1993, is not in Moscow and its vodka is not produced there. Based on those facts, the trademark office originally ruled that the name was "geographically deceptive." But the company appealed and ultimately secured its trademark, in part because the office decided that a consumer's primary reason for selecting the brand was not that it came from Moscow. Side note: Titomirov Vodka was denied a trademark after the owners of Tito's Handmade Vodka argued that they had the name first and that the new brand could confuse consumers.
9 of 10
What about everything-bagel cashews?
Yes.
Cashews and a brand of jerky are the only two foods that have a trademark with "everything bagel" in the name, because they arrived before everything-bagel spice was everywhere. New products seeking to include the phrase are out of luck. "Everything bagel" seasoning has become a victim of what trademark lawyers called genericide -- the name has become so widely used that no single company can claim it. (Still, Trader Joe's owns a trademark for its Everything but the Bagel sesame seasoning.)
10 of 10
Is Cinnanaan a trademark?
Not yet, but maybe later!
An Atlanta-based Indian restaurant chain, Naan Stop, created a dessert using fried strips of naan tossed in cinnamon and sugar. David Perry, the lawyer who secured the trademark for the Cronut, is now trying to do the same for Cinnanaan. Not all products can become as singularly popular as the Cronut, he said, "but that's the aspiration."

Pushback on High Prices Prompts Some Discounts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: "The consumer was a fat pig -- now there's nothing left, and they need to feed the pig again," one banker told DealBook.
The president of McDonald's USA, Joe Erlinger, pushed back on "inaccurate" reports this week that said the chain had more than doubled its prices on some items over the last decade. But his retort wasn't exactly reassuring: The average price of a Big Mac is up 21 percent from 2019.
Erlinger's rebuttal underlines the heat that some companies are facing as the news media, politicians and consumers focus on steadily rising prices. Whether persistent price increases reflect price gouging, or simply companies' own rising costs, is a matter of fierce debate. Either way, one thing is clear: Consumers are becoming fed up.
McDonald's first-quarter earnings fell short of analyst expectations on sales, as "consumers continue to be even more discriminating" with their dollars, the chain's chief executive, Chris Kempczinski said. Starbucks, Target and Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut and KFC, also reported earnings misses, each acknowledging increasingly cautious customers among other factors like the war in the Middle East.
Consumer spending remained surprisingly resilient in the face of stubbornly fast inflation, but now savings from the coronavirus pandemic have dried up, economic growth has slowed and many companies are working to counteract the belief that their prices have gotten out of control.
As one banker told DealBook: "The consumer was a fat pig -- now there's nothing left, and they need to feed the pig again."
The message: Consumers have hit their limit. During periods of rapid inflation, companies tend to push to see how far they can raise prices. "We're taking smaller, more frequent price increases because it gives us the flexibility to be able to see how consumers are reacting and then adjust if or when necessary," Kevin Ozan, the chief financial officer of McDonald's, told analysts in 2022.
But now some businesses, particularly those that primarily serve low- and middle-income customers, are seeing pushback against those increases, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a summary of economic activity across 12 districts that was released on Wednesday. Consumers' resistance to higher prices "led to smaller profit margins as input prices rose on average," the report noted.
If retailers and restaurants can't profit by raising prices, they need to get more people in the door.
Enter a new round of the discount wars. In recent weeks, McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's announced new value meals, while Target, Walmart, Walgreens and Amazon Fresh said they would cut prices on thousands of items. Other companies are becoming more creative: Domino's will offer $ 3 coupons to customers who tip their driver at least $ 3, and in February, Applebee's launched a "date night pass" that gave couples a chance to eat $ 1,500 worth of food for $ 200.
"They're losing customers to some extent, and this is trying to get customers to come back," said Jeremy Horpedahl, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. He added that "part of it is they have to do it if their competitors are doing it."
For some, it's already working: Dine Brands, the parent company of Applebee's, said 28 percent of the restaurant's sales were tied to a limited-time promotion this past quarter, a jump from 19 percent in the previous quarter.
Will the discounts stick around? Many are simply aimed at getting shoppers to buy higher-margin items. And businesses will ultimately stick with whatever best helps their bottom line.
"Companies play around with it to see where the break points are, where the sensitivities are, for the consumer," said Bea Chiem, a director at S&P Global Ratings who leads a team that covers companies that deal in consumer packaged goods and durables.
But if the battle for customers does lead to a broad-based pricing war, that could have a lasting impact: A battle between Walmart and Albertsons helped set up a period of widespread grocery deflation beginning in 2016. Grocery prices are already falling: Average grocery prices, which rose at a peak rate of about 11 percent in 2022, were down in April.
Some retailers have also chosen to go in the opposite direction. Cracker Barrel, whose chief executive recently described the restaurant chain as no longer as relevant as it once was, is raising prices in certain areas after a sales drop. -- Lauren Hirsch and Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump is found guilty on all counts in his hush-money trial. Becoming the first former or sitting president to be convicted in a criminal trial, he was found guilty of falsifying business records to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels, a porn star, after an affair. The verdict didn't stop Wall Street and Silicon Valley executives from donating to his re-election campaign.
ConocoPhillips buys Marathon Oil for $ 22.5 billion. The deal between the Texas energy companies was the latest in a wave of M.&A. in the sector, as the United States has become the world's leading oil producer. Hess shareholders also backed Chevron's $ 53 billion takeover this week.
Elon Musk urges shareholders to support his Tesla pay deal. The electric car maker's C.E.O. offered a personal tour of the company's factory in Austin, Texas, in a post on X asking investors to vote in favor of his $ 46.5 billion remuneration package. Institutional Shareholder Services, a leading proxy adviser, recommended that investors reject the plan, calling it excessive and "outsized from the start."
A contentious conservative effort to gut the government
It's unclear how Trump's conviction this week will affect the presidential election. But a $ 22 million conservative operation aimed at planning for his potential second term is well underway -- and its organizers are collecting résumés.
Project 2025, led by the Heritage Foundation, involves more than 100 right-wing organizations that are drafting policy plans and recruiting "an army of conservatives" from "across the fruited plain" to enact them, as the project director, Paul Dans, put it to DealBook. The think tank wants to institutionalize Trumpism.
Trump and his campaign have not officially endorsed Project 2025, but it dovetails with his plans to gut the government and eradicate what he and Republicans call the "deep state" during a potential second term. The former president has vowed to reinstate an executive order known as Schedule F, which would reclassify some civil servants in a way that made them easier to fire and could allow him to potentially replace about 50,000 career government employees.
Project 2025 aims to be ready with ideologically aligned replacements. "Personnel is policy," said Dans, who served as chief of staff of the Office of Personnel and Management in the waning days of the Trump administration.
Here's a snapshot of the traction it's gotten:
10,000 résumés had been submitted to the Project 2025 database as of May. Candidates are "vetted for alliance" with the project, trained in government process and mechanics and "schooled in the battle plan," Dans said. The group includes "thousands of professionals, moms and people 18 to 80," he added. He also said it had been only four years since Trump was in office, so many previous appointees were waiting in the wings to return.
855,000 people have downloaded the Heritage Foundation's "Mandate for Leadership." The 887-page plan laying out conservative goals has also had "millions of hits" online, according to Dans, and about 2,000 hard copies have been sold.
The project has released 26 training videos. It has four certification programs with multiple courses on the group's website to teach conservative governance, policy drafting, how to deregulate and more.
Dans argues that the project's recruiting arm creates opportunities for many Americans who want to participate in reshaping the government, and that the effort serves "the forgotten man and woman" rather than the interests of "Big Tech or Big Law."
Critics say it's just a publicity stunt. A new report from the nonprofit watchdog Accountable, shared first with DealBook, argues that "its authors include a wide range of lobbyists and private-sector consultants who are using the cover of the MAGA movement to push unprecedented deregulatory policies."
The case for putting employee 'joy' on a par with 'productivity'
Debbie Lovich, a managing partner at BCG, was researching workplace flexibility when she realized a broader factor was at play in the return-to-office debate: "Most people didn't mind going in," she said. "What they minded was the lack of trust -- all of the sudden they were being told what to do and how to do it."
She pivoted her research to focus on what makes people enjoy their jobs, and why leaders should care about it. DealBook spoke with Lovich about setting employee joy as a business goal. The interview has been edited and condensed.
In a recent survey, you found that people who said they enjoy work are also less likely to say they want to quit. Can you say more about that?
You could say that's not so insightful. If you enjoy work, you're less likely to quit. But you're half as likely to quit. In a labor constrained market, that is a really powerful value lever.
What I'm trying to do is to get organizations to really take this enjoyment, or joy, and elevate it up right at the same level as efficiency and effectiveness in their overall goals.
Do you get a lot of pushback from executives? What do you say to change their minds?
Sometimes when people hear the word "joy," they check out a little bit. They say, oh, that's fluff.
I just ask them where in their organization their attrition is the highest, what does that attrition cost them, and what would it be worth if I could cut it in half? I've had clients who have thousands of open positions and are paying $ 100 million a year in overtime to keep operations going.
What is the best way for employers to create more enjoyment at work?
It's not about yoga and Ping-Pong tables. It's about what happens every day in the work itself.
Leaders should take the same skills they use to understand customers -- segment them and come up with value propositions, do design thinking and A/B testing -- and turn them toward employees. What drives joy for one employee may be different than what drives joy for another employee.
Are you thinking about joy in the context of how A.I. is transforming jobs?
I'm nervous that organizations will go after A.I. for productivity alone and make things worse.
I heard one story about a call center where they had generative A.I. take over all the easy, straightforward calls so they could downsize and keep their best customer service agents. And guess what? They all started quitting. They don't want to be yelled at by customers all day. So they had to change the technology to let some of the easy ones through.
It's not necessarily a trade-off of one against the other. It's not "you can make your employees enjoy work more or you could be more productive."
The art is looking for the double word score.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

MOSCOW — The word “victory” is everywhere in Moscow these days.
It is being projected from gargantuan LED screens alongside major intersections and highways and written on red flags whipping in the wind. It’s prominent at an exhibit of Western weapons destroyed on Ukrainian battlefields and lugged back to Moscow as war trophies on display in — where else? — Victory Park.
Victory is precisely the message that President Vladimir Putin, 71, has sought to project as he has been feted with pomp and pageantry after another electoral success, while his army sweeps through Ukrainian villages in a stunning new offensive in the northeast.
“Together, we will be victorious!” Putin said at his inauguration last week after securing a fifth term as president. Two days later, the country celebrated Victory Day, Russia’s most important public holiday, which commemorates the Soviet contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
During the first year of the invasion, many Russians were shocked and ashamed by the war; hundreds of thousands left the country. During the second year, they were concerned about a potential second wave of mobilization.
But with the war now in its third year, many Russians seem to have learned to accept it, interviews over the last week and recent polling show. And “victory” is an easy sell in Putin’s Russia.
Western sanctions have inflicted few economic hardships. The military news from Ukraine is increasingly positive. Yes, soldiers are still returning in coffins, but mostly to families in the hinterlands, not among the Moscow elite. And for many, the deaths only reinforce the idea, pushed by state news media and driven home relentlessly by Putin, that Russia is facing an existential threat from the West.
“We can feel that victory is near,” said Andrei, 43, who said he traveled to Moscow for the May 9 holiday celebrations from the Chita region, almost 3,000 miles from the capital.
Like others interviewed for this story, he declined to provide his last name, indicating apparent mistrust of Western news media.
He was among those who braved the cold and even snow to visit the collection of recently captured Western military equipment. (Ukraine also displays destroyed Russian tanks in the center of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital). But the brash exhibit in Moscow, with flags on the equipment showing which countries donated them to Ukraine, fits Russia’s narrative that it is fighting against the whole developed world — and winning.
“When you see all this, and all these flags, it is clear that the whole world is supplying weapons and you know that a world war is going on,” Andrei said. “It’s Russia against the whole world, as usual.”
Ivan, another visitor to Victory Park, waited his turn to pose in front of the rusted and charred hulk of the German Leopard tank, flashing a smile and giving a thumbs-up as his friend photographed him. People jostled for a spot beside a similarly destroyed American-made M1 Abrams tank.
“There has been so much talk about these Abrams, about these Leopards, and what is the result?” said Ivan, 26.
“They are all standing here, we are looking at them, we see what condition they are in. This is great!” He smiled.
The bravado exhibited by Russians like Andrei and Ivan this month mirrors the confident posture of Putin as he steers Russia past economic challenges and to greater battlefield advantage in Ukraine.
His inauguration included a church service in which he was blessed by the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill I, who expressed hope that the president would remain in power until “the end of the century.”
According to the Levada Center, an independent polling institution, about 75% of Russians profess support for their army’s actions in Ukraine. (About a quarter of the population is against the war, the poll and other research shows, but protests are effectively banned, and repression is so intense that many people are afraid to acknowledge or share anti-war or anti-government content online).
Thousands who fled Russia have returned. Their lives have adapted to the new normal, and have actually changed less than those in the West might expect.
“It’s what, the 13th package of sanctions they’re making?” Ivan said, laughing. “So far, we don’t feel anything.”
Robots built by Yandex, Russia’s homegrown version of Google, can be seen traversing Moscow’s sidewalks making deliveries. Inflation is under control, at least for now. According to a report last month by Forbes, the number of billionaires in Moscow — measured in U.S. dollars — increased so much that the city moved up four spots in the global rankings, behind only New York City.
“Most of the brands that allegedly left Russia have not gone anywhere,” said Andrei, adding that he and his daughter planned to have lunch at a rebranded KFC. What had changed, he said, was that “the consolidation of society has taken place” over the rationale for the war, as well as the conservative social values Putin is pushing.
Putin and others trumpeted that apparent cohesion when the official results of his preordained election victory in March were announced, with a record 88% of the vote going to the incumbent, a figure that Western democracies decried as a sham.
“Russia is such a complicated, multiethnic country that to understand it and govern it, you need more than one term,” said Oleg V. Panchurin, 32, a veteran of the war in Ukraine.
“If it’s going to be President Putin, then I would be happy if he served 10 terms,” said Panchurin, who said had been recently wounded near Zaporizhzhia by a Ukrainian drone.
Some civilians who were interviewed said they were pleased the president had taken a hard-line conservative position promoting traditional family values.
Zhenya, 36, and his girlfriend, Masha, expressed gratitude that the government had “finally handled the LGBTQ issue” — by banning what it called the “LGBTQ movement.” The pair were attending a 1940s-themed Victory Day celebration in a park in central Moscow where participants fox-trotted and waltzed as a live military band played.
With no one who could credibly replace him, the prospect that Putin will stay in power as long as he is alive feels increasingly possible to ordinary Russians, said Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
“Everyone understands that this is for a long time,” he said. “The longer he is in power, the more apprehension there is about who will be next, who will be worse.”
“We are moving closer to a scenario where we could see the effect of Stalin, when, after his death, people were crying, because people didn’t know how to live,” Kolesnikov added.
Russians who oppose the government say they increasingly fear that they will have to wait for Putin’s death for anything to change.
“I feel a very strong sense of hopelessness,” said Yulia, 48, a teacher who was visiting the grave of Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician, in southeast Moscow. Navalny, who died in prison in an Arctic penal colony in February, had long been considered the only possible challenger to Putin. Yulia declined to use her last name out of fear of possible repercussions.
“I don’t see a way out of this,” she said.
Yulia’s son, Pavel, said, “We are sure that everything depends on the death of person in a certain place.” His mother shushed him, noticing the uniformed Russian National Guard forces that stood nearby; even in death, Navalny is still monitored closely by the government. Still, there was a steady stream of visitors to the grave.
On the other side of Moscow, mourners were still coming to show their respects to the 145 victims of the March 22 terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall, one of the deadliest in Europe in the past decade. Floral wreaths, plush toys and photos of the victims were placed near the destroyed concert hall.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, and U.S. officials have blamed the group's Afghanistan affiliate. Even so, the Kremlin has sought to cast blame on Ukraine and the West.
One woman who declined to give her name said she was sure the West was behind it — despite the fact that the United States had warned Moscow of an imminent attack. According to the Levada Center, half of those polled believe Ukraine was behind the attack, with almost 40% saying Western intelligence services were involved.
Vladimir, 26, who was visiting the improvised memorial for the first time, said he didn’t blame the Kremlin for failing to heed the warnings.
“I want the terrorists to be destroyed,” said Vladimir, a supermarket employee. But the president, he said, was doing a great job. “He works so hard.”
“May God keep him alive and healthy,” he said. “If, God forbid, Putin dies, what will happen to our country?”

Full text: Once little more than a lively garnish for pizzas, the sweet-and-spicy condiment has squeezed its way into ice creams, fast-casual bowls and espresso martinis.
In a world gone mad for condiments, hot honey is king.
You can taste it in a Sweetgreen bowl and KFC chicken nuggets, crunch on it in Utz potato chips and pretzels, and savor it in limited-edition ice cream pints. You can buy bottles of it in bulk at Costco, relish it on ricotta toast in Williamsburg wine bars and wear it -- sort of. Mike's Hot Honey, the leading producer of the condiment, even collaborated on a branded sneaker last year.
As of last week, you can go so far as to drink hot honey in an affogato or espresso martini at a Starbucks Reserve, the deluxe locations where the company introduces new flavors and products.
Sweet-and-spicy is not a surprising combination, especially in the South, where honey and hot sauce have long kept company with breakfast biscuits. And sweetened heat has long been a beloved flavor profile across cultures: Thai nam jim gai, sweet chile sauce; ancient Rome's honey and black pepper wine; Central European gingersnaps; Nashville hot chicken.
Introduced as a pizza topping to the American palate a little more than decade ago, hot honey has quickly gone from a drizzle to a deluge. Google searches for it have increased tenfold in the past 10 years, peaking in February. Hot honey has now joined the ranks of pumpkin spice, ranch and chile crisp as flavors that made the leap from cult classic to mainstream darling.
According to many rapturous TikTok videos, its affinity for charcuterie and cheese boards, not to mention chicken tenders and pepperoni pizza, has helped drive the trend -- and inspire recipes.
Recipe: Hot Honey
We have Brooklyn, a cradle of pizza tradition and trends, to thank for hot honey's ascent. In 2009, the innovative pizzeria Roberta's introduced New Yorkers to its Bee Sting pie, topped with spicy soppressata and honey. The pizza's runaway popularity helped Roberta's grow into an empire, with outposts in Los Angeles and a presence in the frozen aisle of grocery stores.
In 2010, Mike Kurtz, a pizza apprentice who had spent years tinkering with a combination of honey, chiles and vinegar, began selling his concoction out of Paulie Gee's in Greenpoint. His story goes like this: 20 years ago, while hiking in Brazil as a college student, he descended, hot and hungry, into a green valley where a lone pizzeria stood. There, he encountered a condiment unknown to him: jars of red chiles macerating in honey.
The slice was transcendent, the flavor combination haunting. Unaware that this condiment would one day become a national obsession (and a $ 40 million annual business), Mr. Kurtz didn't ask for the recipe. "All I remember is that it was run by a Swiss guy," he said.
Hot honey is not a traditional condiment in Brazil, according to multiple Brazilian food experts. "I grew up with pepper jelly, and lots and lots of pepper sauces, but not hot honey," said Leticia Moreinos Schwartz, a food writer who grew up in Rio de Janeiro. In São Paulo, Brazil's unofficial pizza capital, sweet toppings like guava paste with white cheese are popular, but honey -- hot or not -- isn't a traditional offering.
Mr. Kurtz soon began experimenting with a recipe, first in his dorm room and later in the kitchen of Paulie Gee's. As soon as he drizzled the hot honey over the famed pizzaiolo Paul Giannone's renowned pepperoni slice, the Hellboy, a menu mainstay, was born.
Many honey purveyors have produced chile-infused versions to capitalize on the surging interest. Savannah Bee Company, which supplies hot honey to Starbucks and Costco, introduced its version in 2022. Mike's is the top-selling hot sauce on Amazon, despite Mr. Kurtz's insistence that the product is not a hot sauce. Instead of having to push its way onto crowded hot sauce shelves in supermarkets, the product was lucky to land in the sleepy honey aisle, where "nothing had changed for decades," he said.
Last year, as part of its rapidly expanding packaged foods line, Momofuku introduced a hot honey version of its popular chile crunch. Last month, when the company began trying to enforce its trademark of the phrase "chile crunch," it ignited a fierce debate over whether a sauce's name, especially one that consists of commonly used words, can be cornered by a single producer.
Mr. Kurtz said his company did, at one point, look into trademarking "hot honey."
"The lawyers said it wouldn't fly."

Recipe: Hot Honey
By Genevieve Ko
Here’s a sticky elixir to drizzle over everything. Spicy and sweet, this homemade hot honey starts with fresh chiles for a fruity brightness that you can’t get from dried chiles (though they work in this formula, too). Fresh chiles become even more complex when simmered with vinegar. Cooking the acid mellows its harshness but still gives this condiment a nice tang. If you can’t find bird’s-eye chiles or chiles that are as small, you can use a few habanero or Scotch bonnets instead. (If you love heat, you can add as many chiles as you think you can handle.) Be sure to wash the chiles well before using. This honey is delicious drizzled over vegetables, biscuits, cheese, fried chicken, pizza, grilled meat and sandwiches. With its fresh notes, it’s a nice addition to salad dressings, too.
Yield: 1/2 cup
Total time: 20 minutes, plus cooling
Ingredients:
5 to 10 fresh whole red bird’s-eye or other small hot chiles
2 tablespoons white wine or distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup clover or other mild honey
Preparation:
1. Use as many chiles as you want: five for a warm tingle, up to 10 for more burn. Using the tip of a sharp knife, cut little slits in the chiles.
2. Bring the chiles and vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high. Boil until the vinegar reduces by half, about 1 minute. Stir in the honey and reduce the heat to low. Simmer gently for 10 minutes.
3. Pour into a jar, then cool to room temperature. Pluck out and discard the chiles. Refrigerate the hot honey for up to 2 weeks.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The economy as a whole has proved resilient amid the highest rates in decades. But beneath the surface, many low- and moderate-income families are struggling.
High interest rates haven't crashed the financial system, set off a wave of bankruptcies or caused the recession that many economists feared.
But for millions of low- and moderate-income families, high rates are taking a toll.
More Americans are falling behind on payments on credit card and auto loans, even as many are taking on more debt than ever before. Monthly interest expenses have soared since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates two years ago. For families already strained by high prices, dwindling savings and slowing wage growth, increased borrowing costs are pushing them closer to the financial edge.
"It's crazy," said Ora Dorsey, a 43-year-old Army veteran in Clarksville, Tenn. "It does make it hard to get out of debt. It seems like you're only paying the interest."
Ms. Dorsey has been working for years to chip away at the debts she accrued when a series of health issues left her temporarily out of work. Now she is juggling three jobs to try to pay off thousands of dollars in credit card balances and other debts. She is making progress, but high rates aren't helping.
"How am I supposed to retire?" she asked. "I'm not able to save, have that rainy-day fund, because I'm trying to take down the debt that I have."
Ms. Dorsey isn't likely to get relief soon. Fed officials have indicated that they expect to keep interest rates at their current level, the highest in decades, for months. And while policymakers still say they are likely to cut rates eventually, assuming inflation slows down as expected, they could consider raising them further if prices begin rising faster again. The latest evidence will come on Wednesday when the Labor Department releases data showing whether inflation cooled in April, or remained uncomfortably hot for a fourth straight month.
The overall economy has proved unexpectedly resilient to high interest rates. Consumers have continued spending on travel, restaurant meals and entertainment thanks to rising wages and debt levels that, despite their recent increase, remain manageable as a share of income for most people.
But aggregate figures obscure an underlying divide that is likely to widen the longer interest rates remain high. Affluent households, and even many in the middle class, have largely been insulated from the effects of the Fed's policies. Many took out long-term mortgages when rates were at rock bottom in 2020 or earlier -- if they don't own their homes outright -- and most have little if any variable-rate debt. And they are benefiting from higher returns on their savings.
For poorer families, it is different. They are likelier to carry a balance on credit cards, meaning they're more likely to feel high rates. According to Fed data, about 56 percent of people earning less than $ 25,000 carried a credit card balance in 2022, compared with 38 percent of those earning more than $ 100,000. Black Americans, like Ms. Dorsey, and Latinos are also more likely to carry balances.
Recent economic research suggests that high borrowing costs may be one reason for Americans' dim view of the state of the economy. In surveys, lower-income households remain particularly dour about their financial well-being.
Barbara L. Martinez, a financial counselor in Chicago who works at Heartland Alliance, a nonprofit group, said that for many of her low-income clients, debt is inescapable, especially since food prices and rents have soared. They don't have savings to cover unexpected expenses like car repairs or illness. And while high borrowing costs aren't necessarily causing their financial difficulties, they make dealing with debt much harder.
"You're trying to get out of the ocean, but the waves keep pushing you back," she said. "No matter how much you swim, you get tired."
High interest rates are always tougher on borrowers than on savers. But most of the time, they also push down the value of stocks, houses and other assets. That means rate increases usually affect households across the income spectrum, albeit in different ways.
That isn't how things have played out recently. Stock prices fell when the Fed began raising rates, but have rebounded and are near a record. Home prices have continued rising in most of the country.
The result is a growing divide. Fed data suggests that wealth for the upper half dipped after the Fed's initial rate increase in 2022, but is again setting records. For the bottom half, however, wealth remains below its level before the Fed began raising rates, after subtracting credit card and mortgage debt and other liabilities.
"Higher-income households feel very flush," said Brian Rose, senior economist at UBS. "They've seen such a huge run-up in the value of their house and the value of their portfolios that they feel like they can keep spending."
Airlines, hotels and other industries that cater largely to higher-income consumers have generally reported strong profits of late. But mass-market brands like McDonald's and KFC have reported slower sales, with many citing weakness among low-income consumers as part of the reason.
The divergence puts Fed officials in an uncomfortable position: Free spending by wealthy households means high interest rates have done little to curb consumer demand. But with few other inflation-fighting tools, policymakers have little choice but to keep interest rates high -- even if those policies hurt families that are already struggling.
Virginia Diaz thought she was on track for a secure retirement when she moved to Florida from New York nearly 20 years ago. But she drew down her savings and built up credit card debt helping family members, including a niece with health issues. Now high prices and high interest rates are putting her retirement in jeopardy.
"Every time I make a payment to my credit card, most of the money is going to pay interest, and that just snowballs," she said. "I'm at the end of my rope."
Ms. Diaz, 74, said she has cut her spending to the bone -- "If I want to buy a candle, I have to think about it," she said -- and the rest of her family is also struggling. Her nephew, 35, works full time in the insurance industry, but lives in an apartment in her garage because he can't afford to buy a house, or even a car. A friend of her niece's also lives with her, chipping in to pay bills.
Ms. Diaz practically begged Fed officials to cut interest rates.
"I know they mean well, but it's not working," she said. "Lower it, for God's sake, so people can live. Give us half a chance to give us a decent level of living."
Many liberal economists agree, arguing that inflation has fallen enough that the Fed should start cutting rates before it causes more severe economic damage.
"High interest rates really forced cracks in that recovery, and it's folks who are on the margins of our economy who are hit first and hit hardest," said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist at the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive group. "They really serve as a bellwether for what could happen to the rest of our economy."
But Fed officials argue it is essential to bring inflation under control, in part because it, too, has a bigger impact on the poor, who have little room in their budgets to accommodate higher prices.
"If you're a person who's living paycheck to paycheck, and suddenly all the things you buy, the fundamentals of life, go up in price, you are in trouble right away," Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference this month. "And so, with those people in mind in particular, what we're doing is we're using our tools to bring down inflation."
And while high interest rates have affected many families, they have not so far caused the widespread job losses that many progressive critics predicted and that have historically been hardest on lower-wage workers. The unemployment rate remains low, including for Black and Hispanic workers, who are often more prone to lose their jobs when the economy weakens. And wage growth over the past several years has been strongest for lower-paid workers.
For most people, "the big issue is whether you're holding onto your job," said C. Eugene Steuerle, a fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied how monetary policy affects inequality.
But high rates today could make it harder for many families to build wealth in the longer run by making homeownership more difficult. They could also curb the construction of apartments and houses, which over time could further push up rents.
The result: a generation of young adults who fear they can neither afford to buy nor rent.
Chris Nunn, 31, has accumulated more than $ 6,000 in credit card debt, most of it from moving expenses tied to rent increases. His rent in Louisville, Ky., keeps rising, and he sees little hope of paying off the debt with what he makes driving for DoorDash while completing a college degree.
"We don't have the credit to be able to buy a house, and we have a bunch of debt, either student loans or credit card debt," he said. "So we're trapped."

What a Year on Ozempic Taught Me: [Op-Ed]

Author: Hari, Johann

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ever since I was a teenager, I have dreamed of shedding a lot of weight. So when I shrank from 203 pounds to 161 in a year, I was baffled by my feelings. I was taking Ozempic, and I was haunted by the sense that I was cheating and doing something immoral.
I'm not the only one. In the United States (where I now split my time), over 70 percent of people are overweight or obese, and according to one poll, 47 percent of respondents said they were willing to pay to take the new weight-loss drugs. It's not hard to see why. They cause users to lose an average of 10 to 20 percent of their body weight, and clinical trials suggest that the next generation of drugs (probably available soon) leads to a 24 percent loss, on average. Yet as more and more people take drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, we get more confused as a culture, bombarding anyone in the public eye who takes them with brutal shaming.
This is happening because we are trapped in a set of old stories about what obesity is and the morally acceptable ways to overcome it. But the fact that so many of us are turning to the new weight-loss drugs can be an opportunity to find a way out of that trap of shame and stigma -- and to a more truthful story.
In my lifetime, obesity has exploded, from being rare to almost being the norm. I was born in 1979, and by the time I was 21, obesity rates in the United States had more than doubled. They have skyrocketed since. The obvious question is, why? And how do these new weight-loss drugs work? The answer to both lies in one word: satiety. It's a concept that we don't use much in everyday life but that we've all experienced at some point. It describes the sensation of having had enough and not wanting any more.
The primary reason we have gained weight at a pace unprecedented in human history is that our diets have radically changed in ways that have deeply undermined our ability to feel sated. My father grew up in a village in the Swiss mountains, where he ate fresh, whole foods that had been cooked from scratch and prepared on the day they were eaten. But in the 30 years between his childhood and mine, in the suburbs of London, the nature of food transformed across the Western world. He was horrified to see that almost everything I ate was reheated and heavily processed. The evidence is clear that the kind of food my father grew up eating quickly makes you feel full. But the kind of food I grew up eating, much of which is made in factories, often with artificial chemicals, left me feeling empty and as if I had a hole in my stomach. In a recent study of what American children eat, ultraprocessed food was found to make up 67 percent of their daily diet. This kind of food makes you want to eat more and more. Satiety comes late, if at all.
One scientific experiment -- which I have nicknamed Cheesecake Park -- seemed to me to crystallize this effect. Paul Kenny, a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, grew up in Ireland. After he moved in 2000 to the United States, when he was in his 20s, he gained 30 pounds in two years. He began to wonder if the American diet has some kind of strange effect on our brains and our cravings, so he designed an experiment to test it. He and his colleague Paul Johnson raised a group of rats in a cage and gave them an abundant supply of healthy, balanced rat chow made out of the kind of food rats had been eating for a very long time. The rats would eat it when they were hungry, and then they seemed to feel sated and stopped. They did not become fat.
But then Dr. Kenny and his colleague exposed the rats to an American diet: fried bacon, Snickers bars, cheesecake and other treats. They went crazy for it. The rats would hurl themselves into the cheesecake, gorge themselves and emerge with their faces and whiskers totally slicked with it. They quickly lost almost all interest in the healthy food, and the restraint they used to show around healthy food disappeared. Within six weeks, their obesity rates soared.
After this change, Dr. Kenny and his colleague tweaked the experiment again (in a way that seems cruel to me, a former KFC addict). They took all the processed food away and gave the rats their old healthy diet. Dr. Kenny was confident that they would eat more of it, proving that processed food had expanded their appetites. But something stranger happened. It was as though the rats no longer recognized healthy food as food at all, and they barely ate it. Only when they were starving did they reluctantly start to consume it again.
Though Dr. Kenny's study was in rats, we can see forms of this behavior everywhere. We are all living in Cheesecake Park -- and the satiety-stealing effect of industrially assembled food is evidently what has created the need for these medications. Drugs like Ozempic work precisely by making us feel full. Carel le Roux, a scientist whose research was important to the development of these drugs, says they boost what he and others once called "satiety hormones."
Once you understand this context, it becomes clear that processed and ultraprocessed food create a raging hole of hunger, and these treatments can repair that hole. Michael Lowe, a professor of psychology at Drexel University who has studied hunger for 40 years, told me the drugs are "an artificial solution to an artificial problem."
Yet we have reacted to this crisis largely caused by the food industry as if it were caused only by individual moral dereliction. I felt like a failure for being fat and was furious with myself for it. Why do we turn our anger inward and not outward at the main cause of the crisis? And by extension, why do we seek to shame people taking Ozempic but not those who, say, take drugs to lower their blood pressure?
The answer, I think, lies in two very old notions. The first is the belief that obesity is a sin. When Pope Gregory I laid out the seven deadly sins in the sixth century, one of them was gluttony, usually illustrated with grotesque-seeming images of overweight people. Sin requires punishment before you can get to redemption. Think about the competition show "The Biggest Loser," on which obese people starve and perform extreme forms of exercise in visible agony in order to demonstrate their repentance.
The second idea is that we are all in a competition when it comes to weight. Ours is a society full of people fighting against the forces in our food that are making us fatter. It is often painful to do this: You have to tolerate hunger or engage in extreme forms of exercise. It feels like a contest in which each thin person creates additional pressure on others to do the same. Looked at in this way, people on Ozempic can resemble athletes like the cyclist Lance Armstrong who used performance-enhancing drugs. Those who manage their weight without drugs might think, "I worked hard for this, and you get it for as little as a weekly jab?"
We can't find our way to a sane, nontoxic conversation about obesity or Ozempic until we bring these rarely spoken thoughts into the open and reckon with them. You're not a sinner for gaining weight. You're a typical product of a dysfunctional environment that makes it very hard to feel full. If you are angry about these drugs, remember the competition isn't between you and your neighbor who's on weight-loss drugs. It's between you and a food industry constantly designing new ways to undermine your satiety. If anyone is the cheat here, it's that industry. We should be united in a struggle against it and its products, not against desperate people trying to find a way out of this trap.
There are extraordinary benefits as well as disturbing risks associated with weight-loss drugs. Reducing or reversing obesity hugely boosts health, on average: We know from years of studying bariatric surgery that it slashes the risks of cancer, heart disease and diabetes-related death. Early indications are that the new anti-obesity drugs are moving people in a similar radically healthier direction, massively reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. But these drugs may increase the risk for thyroid cancer. I am worried they diminish muscle mass and fear they may supercharge eating disorders. This is a complex picture in which the evidence has to be weighed very carefully.
But we can't do that if we remain lost in stories inherited from premodern popes or in a senseless competition that leaves us all, in the end, losers. Do we want these weight loss drugs to be another opportunity to tear one another down? Or do we want to realize that the food industry has profoundly altered the appetites of us all -- leaving us trapped in the same cage, scrambling to find a way out?

Full text: On earnings calls, dozens of corporate executives have cited a slowdown in spending to explain why sales are slipping.
The "stretched" consumer
Better than expected quarterly earnings have helped propel the S&P 500 to within a whisker of a record high on Friday. But Wall Street and Washington are closely monitoring another worrying economic indicator: the struggling consumer.
The split-screen view of the economy is becoming clearer as earnings season draws to a close. Mass-market brands, like the fast-food companies McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks, have reported that a lot of customers are pulling back on spending as high inflation bites. But less price-sensitive sectors, such as airlines and hospitality, say customers are still booking flights, hotel rooms and tables at pricier restaurants.
The starkly different snapshots may explain why voters give President Biden poor marks for economic management, even as jobs are plentiful and growth is resilient. This is "an economy of the haves and have-nots," Michael Reid, an economist for RBC Capital Markets, told DealBook. "The haves just have so much more spending power."
What's making "the haves" so flush: They tend to have little to no mortgage debt or car or student loans, and their stock-market-tied retirement accounts have accumulated healthy gains to finance vacations or nights out.
But the less-affluent are feeling the pinch. They've blown through their pandemic savings, and they're racking up credit card and other loan debt. One area to watch: A surge in "buy now, pay later" programs may be masking America's "phantom" consumer debt problem.
Company executives are increasingly warning about this cohort. On earnings calls this quarter, we've seen an uptick in the number of times C.E.O.s and C.F.O.s cite "low-income consumers" to explain why sales are slipping or why they give lackluster guidance on profit.
Here's what they're saying:
John Peyton, C.E.O. of Dine Brands Global, the parent of Applebee's and IHOP restaurants, told analysts that lower-income consumers are "more aggressively managing their check, finding our value-oriented items."
Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo's C.E.O., was more blunt. "The lower-income consumer in the U.S. is stretched," he said, adding that this type of customer "is strategizing a lot to make their budgets get to the end of the month."
Hal Lawton, C.E.O. of Tractor Supply Company, the farming retailer, sees something similar: "In the first quarter, our upper-income consumer over-indexed in big ticket categories and recreational purchases compared to our lower-income consumer, who is prioritizing their spend on needs."
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Israel hits out at President Biden's threat to withhold more weapons. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country would "stand alone" if needed after the U.S. refused to send bombs that could be used in a major assault on the Gazan city of Rafah. The comments are the latest sign of a widening rift between Israel and the Biden administration over the war.
T-Mobile and Verizon are said to be in talks that would divvy up U.S. Cellular. The telecommunications giants are in discussions to split one of the country's last big regional wireless carriers, with each getting a different part of the business, according to The Wall Street Journal. One scenario: T-Mobile's U.S. arm would pay $ 2 billion for some operations and wireless spectrum licenses; Verizon is in talks on a separate deal with U.S. Cellular.
The White House is reportedly planning to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The government could target some of China's key strategic sectors including E.V., batteries and solar cell manufacturing as soon as next week, according to Bloomberg. Biden has called Chinese E.V.s a national security threat and has accused China of using unfair industrial policies to distort markets.
Apple apologizes for the iPad ad that spurred a big backlash. The tech giant said a 60-second spot that showed a giant machine crushing tools used by artists had "missed the mark" and that it would not run on TV. The ad was slammed by actors, artists and designers, who said it was a metaphor for Big Tech destroying or co-opting their work.
How Biden and Trump are wooing business
President Biden is on a West Coast fund-raising tour, looking to extend his money lead over Donald Trump. The trip caps a week during which the president pitched his economic policies to business leaders to gain their support and reports emerged of some of Donald Trump's promises to C.E.O.s to win their backing and donations.
Biden is heading to Silicon Valley and Seattle. Vinod Khosla, the venture capital investor, and Marissa Mayer, the former Yahoo C.E.O., will host two separate events on Friday, as first reported by Puck. Biden will then head to Seattle for a fund-raiser tomorrow.
The trip follows a push to gain business leaders' support. Biden hosted seven C.E.O.s at the White House on Tuesday, including Citi's Jane Fraser, the Evercore founder Roger Altman and the United Airlines boss Scott Kirby to talk geopolitics and economics.
Biden administration officials are ramping up outreach. Jeff Zients, Biden's chief of staff, and others drew up a list of more than 100 C.E.O.s to contact (the White House hasn't disclosed their names). The group of officials charged with smoothing relations with boardrooms -- dubbed "The Hub" -- includes Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary; Lael Brainard, the director of the National Economic Council; and Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary. "At the president and Jeff's request, we're strategically engaging with business leaders," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, told DealBook.
Biden wants the C.E.O.s to help make his case. The administration is asking executives, including the former PayPal C.E.O. Dan Schulman, to call other business leaders for feedback that they might not give the president directly, a senior official said.
Many in big business haven't been happy with his first term. Some executives are frustrated by Biden's plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and companies. Business groups have sued Lina Khan's F.T.C. for banning noncompete agreements and banks say that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under Rohit Chopra has gone "rogue" in applying his pro-consumer agenda.
Trump is promising business that he'll roll back Biden-era rules. The Republican candidate told Big Oil executives last month that they should give $ 1 billion to his campaign because he would kill environmental rules that have hit the industry. He also has promised to extend the tax cuts he passed as president and said he would slash further if re-elected.
Fast-food executive charged in "sham" loan case
Federal prosecutors on Friday have charged Andrew Wiederhorn, chairman of Fat Brands, the parent of the fast-food chains Fatburger, Johnny Rockets and Hot Dog on a Stick, with orchestrating a series of "sham" payments that netted him $ 47 million.
Federal prosecutors accused Wiederhorn of concealing payments from the company to him between 2010 and 2021. They were categorized as "shareholder loans," and made directly from the board, according to a grand jury indictment released on Friday. Wiederhorn "had no intention of repaying these sham 'loans'," the filing says. The charges include tax evasion, filing false tax returns, wire fraud and certifying faulty financial reports.
Wiederhorn has had previous run-ins with the law. Twenty years ago, he served a federal prison sentence on filing a false tax return and other charges associated with his running of Fog Cutter Capital, a holding company. His case drew national media attention, including in The Times, as Fog Cutter continued to pay his salary, a bonus and "leave of absence pay" while he served his 18-month sentence.
Wiederhorn founded Fat Brands in 2017. . In February, the publicly listed company informed shareholders that the S.E.C. was investigating Wiederhorn and two other unidentified associates in a possible criminal matter, but did not disclose details. At the time, the company said it was cooperating with the authorities.
The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The other defendants named in Friday's indictment are William Amon, Rebecca Hershinger and the Fat Brands company.
"There is no law that says that the Fed moves first."
-- Andrew Bailey , the Bank of England governor, has signaled that the central bank could cut interest rates as soon as this summer -- potentially ahead of the Fed. Meanwhile, first-quarter G.D.P. data released on Friday showed the British economy had emerged from recession .
A not-so-sweet cocoa rally
Cocoa prices have been on a roller-coaster ride this year, leaving some of the biggest food companies in the world unsure of how to price their chocolate. The market volatility began with a disappointing 2023 cocoa crop. The commodity price more than tripled in a matter of months, reaching a record of more than $ 11,000 per ton in mid-April.
What will this mean for chocolate lovers? Mondelez, the makers of Chips Ahoy cookies and Cadbury chocolates, raised prices by about 6 percent in the first quarter, and Hershey did so by about 5 percent. Both companies said they wouldn't rule out further price increases if cocoa prices stay high.

Full text: COMPANIES
CVS Health Cuts Outlook Below Wall St. Forecast
CVS Health missed first-quarter expectations and chopped its 2024 outlook more than a dollar below Wall Street's forecast.
Shares of the health care giant plunged Wednesday after the company said it was struggling with rising costs from care use in its Medicare Advantage business.
The company told analysts they were still dealing with rising use from outpatient care and in supplemental benefits. The company also saw some new pressure from inpatient care.
CEO Karen Lynch said the company's visibility into trends during the quarter was impaired by the cyberattack on Change Healthcare, which is operated by rival UnitedHealth Group. Change provides technology used to submit and process insurance claims for several insurers.
CVS Health had already scaled back 2024 expectations earlier this year as it worked to understand why costs from Medicare Advantage. ASSOCIATED PRESS
FOOD
Yum Brand Shares Hurt
By Uneven Demand
Yum Brands reported a fall in quarterly global same-store sales on Wednesday, hurt by choppy demand for its KFC and Pizza Hut brands from inflation-weary consumers in the United States as well as in overseas markets.
Consumers in the United States are increasingly looking for value-oriented meals in the face of sticky inflation, pushing fast food chains to double down on promotions and offers and on revamping their store and order experiences.
Shares of Yum Brands fell 3 percent after the Pizza Hut parent joined coffee giant Starbucks in recording its first drop in total same-store sales in about three years.
The company's quarterly results also echo that of burger giant McDonald's, which missed profit estimates for the first time in two years as consumers with constrained discretionary budgets hunt for better bargains while dining out. REUTERS
CREDIT CARDS
Mastercard Profits
Rise Above Expectations
Mastercard reported first-quarter profit that exceeded Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, on higher card spending by consumers despite rising borrowing costs and persistent inflation.
Wage growth and a tight labor market have ensured job security for card users, allowing them to spend without restraint even as the Federal Reserve keeps monetary policy tight.
The payments processor earned $ 3.31 per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates of $ 3.24 a share, according to LSEG data.
Travel trends in Asia Pacific, which lifted pandemic curbs later than the rest of the world, continued to be a drag due to tougher comparisons from last year.
Mastercard's shares dipped 0.6 percent as the company's cross-border spending volumes for the first four weeks of April slowed, but it said that was tied to the timing of Easter. REUTERS

A Ragtag Resistance Sees the Tide Turning in a Forgotten War

LOIKAW, Myanmar — The night Suu Kyi thought she would die of her wounds on the front lines of a forgotten war, a crescent moon hung overhead. A pendant of the Virgin Mary dangled around her neck. Maybe those augurs saved her. Or maybe, she said, it was not yet time for her to die.
“When I joined the revolution, I knew my chances of surviving were 50-50,” Suu Kyi, 21, said of her decision to enlist as a rebel soldier, fighting to overthrow the junta that returned Myanmar to military dictatorship three years ago. “I’m an ordinary girl, an ordinary young person. I believe in federal democracy and human rights.”
Suu Kyi said the words “federal democracy” in English. There are no easy words for the concept in Burmese.
Since the junta in Myanmar staged its coup in February 2021, ending a brief period of democratic reform and training its guns once again on peaceful protesters, much of the country has turned against the military. A new generation, which came of age during the civilian administration of the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has taken to arms, joining rebels who have opposed military dictatorship for decades.
The world’s gaze has remained focused on other conflicts on other continents — to the consternation of many in Myanmar who wonder why the chaos and death here brings little global outcry. Now, after three years of desperate resistance, the battle lines are changing fast. The rebels have overrun scores of military bases and taken over dozens of towns. The tempo of victory has quickened in recent days, and anti-junta forces now claim to control more than half of Myanmar’s territory, from lowland jungles to the foothills of the Himalayas.
Much of the fighting’s rhythm seems syncopated to that of another century: trenches dug into unrelenting mud, the slide of flip-flops down monsoon-soaked hills, the clatter of homemade AK-style assault rifles in dusty towns. The junta’s multiple rocket launchers and fighter jets may bring a modern touch to the killing, as does the hovering of the resistance’s battle drones. But this conflict, with its hand-to-hand combat and profusion of land mines, feels like a throwback to the kind of civil war that was documented in black and white.
If they manage to push into the nation’s heartland — no sure thing — the insurgents could unseat a military that has, in one form or another, kept Myanmar in its grip for more than half a century. The result may be not so much a shifting of power as a shattering of a nation, its vast periphery breaking permanently away from central control.
“We want liberation from the Myanmar army,” Suu Kyi said. “I am willing to sacrifice myself for that.”
The insurgents are apportioned into hundreds of armed groups scattered across the country. In some battle zones, half a dozen different militias have united to combat the junta’s forces, sometimes with no clear chain of command. Some are led by veteran soldiers from ethnic armies that have long waged war with the Myanmar military — and, on occasion, with each other. Others were formed by lawmakers who picked up weapons after the coup curtailed their political careers. A lawyer heads one rebel force, a former student of economics another. At least one poet commands a small army.
The resistance is largely bankrolled through crowdfunding by the Myanmar diaspora: More than 4 million lived abroad before the coup, according to the United Nations, and the outflow has intensified since then. Other funding, particularly for certain ethnic armed groups, derives from the trade in illicit drugs or taxes on the gray economy. Although countries like the United States have pledged money for democracy-building and placed financial sanctions on members of the military regime and its cronies, they have not publicly allocated money for the armed rebellion.
Suu Kyi’s militia is called the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force, or KNDF. Claiming more than 8,000 soldiers, it is an umbrella organization for bands of armed youth in Karenni, Myanmar’s smallest state and the site of some of the most intense fighting. Its front-line strategist, Deputy Cmdr. Maui Phoe Thaike, is an environmentalist who studied at the University of Montana at Missoula.
The KNDF and its allied militias could soon control all of Karenni, making it the first state in Myanmar to break free from junta control, military analysts say. In a series of nationwide offensives starting last fall, insurgents have repelled the junta from large swaths of Myanmar’s north, west and east. This month, guerrillas captured a major trading town on the border with Thailand. Naypyitaw, the capital of Myanmar built by the junta as a defensive fortress, is fewer than 150 miles from Karenni.
Facing resistance on many fronts, the junta said in February that it was implementing conscription for all young men and women in the country. Morale has plunged, deserters from the military said, even as the bombardment of civilians has intensified.
Throughout the military’s half a century in power, various rebel forces have tried to unseat the generals. All have failed. This time, the opposition says, is different, in part because much of the country’s Bamar ethnic majority has found unity with minorities living in the border regions.
The young people who grew up during a period of openness, when Myanmar welcomed foreign innovations such as Facebook and KFC, chafe at how the junta has once again closed off the country. They know how much they have lost with the generals’ inward turn, and they have used social media to expose the junta’s atrocities: the imprisonment and torture of thousands of civilians, airstrikes on schools and hospitals, the killing of children with single shots to the head.
Still, it’s far from certain whether the insurgents — not to mention the 214,000 government workers who are still striking as part of a civil disobedience campaign — can maintain their resolve for a fourth year or more.
Myanmar’s civil war is taking place far from the international spotlight that has clung to the conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip. The inequity has mystified some of the 55 million people of Myanmar, who in the months after the coup lobbied the United Nations to intervene to protect a vulnerable population. No help came. Not a single country has recognized Myanmar’s pro-democracy shadow government, despite the accolades won by civilian leaders when they began sharing power with the military nearly a decade ago.
But even as their plight has failed to capture global attention, doctors, lawyers, police officers, teachers, air force pilots and others have fled to rebel-held areas to lend expertise to the armed resistance. There are thousands of such professionals now living in the jungles of Myanmar. There are thousands more on the front lines.
After the junta’s forces gunned down unarmed protesters in the wake of the coup, Linn Ni Zho, a medical student, fled to Karenni state and helped set up a secret hospital to treat rebel soldiers, as well as civilians maimed by land mines and airstrikes. The hospital is now the only major one operating in Karenni, as the military’s aerial bombardment, per capita, outpaces the Russian campaign in Ukraine.
“Looking for the help of the U.N., looking for the help of the international governments, is like walking in the dark,” Linn Ni Zho said. “We have to do by ourself to escape from this kind of hell.”
‘We Had Big Dreams’
In an emergency ward camouflaged with netting and leaves, served only by a forest track, Linn Ni Zho tended to the casualties of war. The tools of a jungle hospital surrounded her: saws for amputations, yards of gauze for bullet wounds and a generator to power lights for surgery.
Severing limbs pulverized by land mines or plunging her arms into chest cavities torn apart by mortars was not what Linn Ni Zho thought she would be doing when she chose to study medicine. Now 25, she grew up as Myanmar’s military rulers voluntarily began sharing power with civilians.
Before that change, possessing an unregistered cellphone or foreign currency could land a person in prison for years. Listening to BBC radio broadcasts meant risking arrest.
By the time Linn Ni Zho was in college, she was making pocket money selling La Mer and Lancôme beauty products online, sourced from a relative living in California. She downloaded American sitcoms on her phone — “Emily in Paris” is a current favorite — and considered setting up a private practice.
“All of us had big dreams, but I think they were normal dreams,” she said of her generation.
The coup three years ago began with an internet blackout and the arrests of Myanmar’s civilian Cabinet, including Aung San Suu Kyi. For a citizenry collectively hunched over phones, checking Facebook, the halt to communications came as a shock. (Today in most of Karenni, there is no phone or internet service.)
Within 20 days of the coup, the junta’s snipers had shot dead the first peaceful protester, a 20-year-old woman standing in a crowd. Since then, more than 4,800 protesters and political prisoners have been killed, and 26,500 people have been arrested, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), which uses the former name for Myanmar.
“We lost all of our lives, all of our futures, with our human rights, civil rights violated every day,” Linn Ni Zho said. “When dictatorship came, I just could not accept it as a youth.”
Linn Ni Zho escaped to Karenni, also known as Kayah, which is home to ethnic minorities who have long been persecuted. For the first time, a significant multiethnic resistance was forming.
With others from Myanmar’s Bamar-dominated cities, Linn Ni Zho set up a hospital.
But in 2022, fighter jets targeted the facility. The medics built a new hospital deep in a forest to protect against airstrikes. The staff live in huts, bunkers dug into the earth for the bombardment they believe is inevitable.
“They can destroy the buildings, but they cannot destroy our willpower,” Linn Ni Zho said.
Last November, resistance fighters rushed a soldier to the hospital: It was Suu Kyi, the young rebel with the Virgin Mary pendant, who had been wounded during the KNDF’s attempt to take Loikaw, the state capital.
Earlier in the day, she was sheltering in a shot-up building in a shot-up city, one that had emptied of 50,000 residents in a few days. Junta troops staked out a position across the street, so close that the astringent smell of the betel they chewed mixed with the fumes of war. An artillery shell detonated near Suu Kyi.
“I could not feel my body,” she said. “I thought this is what it feels like to die.”
An X-ray confirmed to Linn Ni Zho, who was on duty that day, that shrapnel had hurtled through Suu Kyi’s back and pierced her lung. All they could do was wait to see if there was serious internal bleeding.
Three months later, Suu Kyi was back on the front line in Loikaw, an assault rifle slung over her shoulder. Shrapnel remained lodged in her body. The enemy was close.
On the way to visit her, New York Times journalists passed a Buddhist pagoda balanced, golden and delicate, on a rocky outcrop. The street had once hummed with pilgrims and schoolchildren. There had been a sushi bar.
Now, the street was deserted, save the resistance fighters taking us to the abandoned house the KNDF had taken for an outpost. Spent bullets glistened on the ground. Barricades had been forsaken, metal twisted into ominous sculptures of war.
Suu Kyi was on the fourth day of a weeklong rotation. It had been a good day, she said: no artillery strikes nearby. She smiled.
But then small-arms fire cascaded from the Myanmar military’s hillside position, striking just outside the house and flashing bright in the midday sun. Suu Kyi smiled again as her fellow soldiers took aim out a window.
A cat left behind by the house’s owners meowed in alarm. Suu Kyi reached down to stroke it. Before COVID, before the coup, before the war, she was to study geography in college. She was to become a teacher. The cat brushed against Suu Kyi, threading her legs in a nervous pattern, then slinked behind sandbags.
“Maybe after we win the revolution, I can continue my life again,” she said. “Maybe not me, but people of my generation.”
‘He Will Be a Soldier’
In a pine clearing in Karenni State, 84 young men and 10 young women of the KNDF’s 8th Battalion stood at attention. After 11 days of basic training, the soldiers were kitted out in new uniforms. New assault rifles leaned against trees. The soldiers saluted and pledged support for “federal democracy,” in English.
Before them stood 10 portraits of young men of the 8th Battalion who had died in combat, out of about 400 soldiers. In a day or two, this next batch was heading to the front lines.
A loudspeaker played a message from the KNDF leader, Bedu. Once a civil society activist, Bedu had been jailed by Myanmar’s military dictatorship. In prison, he and other founders of the militia were tortured, they said. Their heads were wrapped in plastic bags, each breath robbing them of oxygen until the bag no longer moved into their mouths.
The KNDF is both an example of how passionate guerrillas can repel a large and overstretched army and of such a militia’s limits. The commander of the 8th Battalion used to drive a tour bus. One KNDF strategist was a national snooker champion. Another worked the docks in Singapore.
Maui Phoe Thaike was busy with organic farming projects when the coup occurred. Today, he sends soldiers into battle.
“I made a lot of mistakes at first, and a lot of our soldiers died,” he said. “But we learn every time, and we are getting stronger and stronger.”
Tattooed on his back is a partial record of the battlefield’s toll: tally marks in bundles of five, each representing a life lost. The lines stretch over his left shoulder, but he stopped adding them last May, before the militia’s biggest offensives. In the assault on Loikaw late last year, at least 150 soldiers died, one KNDF leader said. Another counted the number at double that.
“I might run out of space on my back,” Maui Phoe Thaike said. “I don’t want to think about that.”
On March 25, four more members of the 8th Battalion were killed in Loikaw.
Today, more than 80% of the population of Karenni state is internally displaced. As the Myanmar army retreated, its troops scattered land mines like rice seed, creating lasting hazards for civilians and combatants alike. In a Christmas Eve attack two years ago, junta forces killed about 35 civilians, including aid workers, leaving their charred bodies in vehicles on a road in Karenni.
“We tried to protest peacefully, but the only language the Burma army understands is bullets,” said Maui Phoe Thaike, himself a member of the Bamar ethnic majority. “Armed resistance is the only way for our revolution to succeed.”
Karenni forces said in late March that they held 90% of the state. The Myanmar military calls civilians “terrorists” and terrorizes them with airstrikes and long-range artillery.
For all the new recruits into Myanmar’s rebel forces — the college students and Buddhist monks and civil servants — other soldiers have been fighting for far longer.
When the military staged its first coup in 1962, isolating a once cosmopolitan country, its excuse was that the new nation was fragmenting. Ethnic rebels were bearing down on the capital, demanding autonomy or at least a federal democracy.
In the decades since, the military has continued to oppress ethnic minorities through organized sexual violence, the torching of villages and a policy of making ethnic minority children walk ahead of soldiers in minefields — tactics that United Nations investigators have called crimes against humanity. The civilian administration that shared power with the military until the 2021 coup stood by, too, as the army targeted one ethnic group, the Muslim Rohingya, with what the United States considers genocide.
Pal Law has been a soldier since he was 9, fighting for another Karenni rebel force. Last year, the Myanmar military stormed through his village, burning and looting. An airstrike tore the roof off the church.
One afternoon, Pal Law, 29, surveyed the charred remains of his home, stepping carefully for fear of mines. He sipped a jug of homemade alcohol, rice grains swollen in the fermented murk. The soldiers with him downed beers. Deserters from the junta’s forces say synthetic drug use is rampant. For both sides in this grinding war, respite is sought in an altered state.
After leaving his destroyed village, on roads cratered by mine blasts, Pal Law ordered the truck to stop for an impromptu target practice. He guzzled his moonshine. He lay on the red earth, aiming his rifle. Not a single shot found its mark.
“I like to fight,” he said, his words slurring. “I am good at fighting.”
After so long in power, the Myanmar military has infiltrated every crevice of the society and economy. In the borderlands, many ethnic armed groups hold similar sway. They collect taxes, and then when the Myanmar army comes back, it collects its own. The people remain impoverished.
In the resistance stronghold of Demoso, where the roads into town are lined with refugee encampments, Maui Phoe Thaike presided over a baby-naming ceremony for the son of a KNDF soldier. Around him, men spoke of federal democracy and clutched assault rifles. One, a recent amputee, leaned on crutches. The militia’s top brass gathered around the newborn. The deputy commander cooed. The baby cooed back.
The father, once a civil servant, cradled his child. If there were peace, would his son be able to one day enjoy the calm of civilian life, away from the blood and dust of war?
“No, he will be a soldier,” Maui Phoe Thaike answered. “He will be a man and fight.”

The night Suu Kyi thought she would die of her wounds on the front lines of a forgotten war, a crescent moon hung overhead. A pendant of the Virgin Mary dangled around her neck. Maybe those augurs saved her. Or maybe, she said, it was not yet time for her to die.
“When I joined the revolution, I knew my chances of surviving were 50-50,” Suu Kyi, 21, said of her decision to enlist as a rebel soldier, fighting to overthrow the junta that returned Myanmar to military dictatorship three years ago. “I’m an ordinary girl, an ordinary young person. I believe in federal democracy and human rights.”
Suu Kyi said the words “federal democracy” in English. There are no easy words for the concept in Burmese.
Since the junta in Myanmar staged its coup in February 2021, ending a brief period of democratic reform and training its guns once again on peaceful protesters, much of the country has turned against the military. A new generation, which came of age during the civilian administration of the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has taken to arms, joining rebels who have opposed military dictatorship for decades.
Now, after three years of desperate resistance, the battle lines are changing fast. The rebels have overrun scores of military bases and taken over dozens of towns. The tempo of victory has quickened in recent days, and anti-junta forces now claim to control more than half of Myanmar’s territory, from lowland jungles to the foothills of the Himalayas.
Much of the fighting’s rhythm seems syncopated to that of another century: trenches dug into unrelenting mud, the slide of flip-flops down monsoon-soaked hills, the clatter of homemade AK-style assault rifles in dusty towns. The junta’s multiple rocket launchers and fighter jets may bring a modern touch to the killing, as does the hovering of the resistance’s battle drones. But this conflict, with its hand-to-hand combat and profusion of land mines, feels like a throwback to the kind of civil war that was documented in black and white.
If they manage to push into the nation’s heartland — no sure thing — the insurgents could unseat a military that has, in one form or another, kept Myanmar in its grip for more than half a century. The result may be not so much a shifting of power as a shattering of a nation, its vast periphery breaking permanently away from central control.
“We want liberation from the Myanmar army,” Suu Kyi said. “I am willing to sacrifice myself for that.”
Suu Kyi’s militia is called the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force, or KNDF. Claiming more than 8,000 soldiers, it is an umbrella organization for bands of armed youth in Karenni, Myanmar’s smallest state and the site of some of the most intense fighting. Its front-line strategist, Deputy Cmdr. Maui Phoe Thaike, is an environmentalist who studied at the University of Montana at Missoula.
The KNDF and its allied militias could soon control all of Karenni, making it the first state in Myanmar to break free from junta control, military analysts say. In a series of nationwide offensives starting last fall, insurgents have repelled the junta from large swaths of Myanmar’s north, west and east. This month, guerrillas captured a major trading town on the border with Thailand. Naypyitaw, the capital of Myanmar built by the junta as a defensive fortress, is fewer than 150 miles from Karenni.
Throughout the military’s half a century in power, various rebel forces have tried to unseat the generals. All have failed. This time, the opposition says, is different, in part because much of the country’s Bamar ethnic majority has found unity with minorities living in the border regions.
The young people who grew up during a period of openness, when Myanmar welcomed foreign innovations such as Facebook and KFC, chafe at how the junta has once again closed off the country. They know how much they have lost with the generals’ inward turn, and they have used social media to expose the junta’s atrocities: the imprisonment and torture of thousands of civilians, airstrikes on schools and hospitals, the killing of children with single shots to the head.
Still, it’s far from certain whether the insurgents — not to mention the 214,000 government workers who are still striking as part of a civil disobedience campaign — can maintain their resolve for a fourth year or more.
In an emergency ward camouflaged with netting and leaves, served only by a forest track, Linn Ni Zho tended to the casualties of war. The tools of a jungle hospital surrounded her: saws for amputations, yards of gauze for bullet wounds and a generator to power lights for surgery.
Severing limbs pulverized by land mines or plunging her arms into chest cavities torn apart by mortars was not what Linn Ni Zho thought she would be doing when she chose to study medicine. Now 25, she grew up as Myanmar’s military rulers voluntarily began sharing power with civilians.
The coup three years ago began with an internet blackout and the arrests of Myanmar’s civilian Cabinet. For a citizenry collectively hunched over phones, checking Facebook, the halt to communications came as a shock. (Today in most of Karenni, there is no phone or internet service.)
Within 20 days of the coup, the junta’s snipers had shot dead the first peaceful protester, a 20-year-old woman standing in a crowd. Since then, more than 4,800 protesters and political prisoners have been killed, and 26,500 people have been arrested, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), which uses the former name for Myanmar.
“We lost all of our lives, all of our futures, with our human rights, civil rights violated every day,” Linn Ni Zho said. “When dictatorship came, I just could not accept it as a youth.”
Linn Ni Zho escaped to Karenni, also known as Kayah, which is home to ethnic minorities who have long been persecuted. For the first time, a significant multiethnic resistance was forming.
With others from Myanmar’s Bamar-dominated cities, Linn Ni Zho set up a hospital.
But in 2022, fighter jets targeted the facility. The medics built a new hospital deep in a forest to protect against airstrikes. The staff live in huts, bunkers dug into the earth for the bombardment they believe is inevitable.
Last November, resistance fighters rushed a soldier to the hospital: It was Suu Kyi, the young rebel with the Virgin Mary pendant, who had been wounded during the KNDF’s attempt to take Loikaw, the state capital.
Earlier in the day, she was sheltering in a shot-up building in a shot-up city, one that had emptied of 50,000 residents in a few days. Junta troops staked out a position across the street. An artillery shell detonated near Suu Kyi.
“I could not feel my body,” she said. “I thought this is what it feels like to die.”
An X-ray confirmed to Linn Ni Zho, who was on duty that day, that shrapnel had hurtled through Suu Kyi’s back and pierced her lung. All they could do was wait to see if there was serious internal bleeding.
Three months later, Suu Kyi was back on the front line in Loikaw, an assault rifle slung over her shoulder. Shrapnel remained lodged in her body. The enemy was close.
On the way to visit her, New York Times journalists passed a Buddhist pagoda balanced, golden and delicate, on a rocky outcrop. The street had once hummed with pilgrims and schoolchildren. There had been a sushi bar.
Now, the street was deserted, save the resistance fighters taking us to the abandoned house the KNDF had taken for an outpost. Spent bullets glistened on the ground. Barricades had been forsaken, metal twisted into ominous sculptures of war.
Suu Kyi was on the fourth day of a weeklong rotation. It had been a good day, she said: no artillery strikes nearby. She smiled.
But then small-arms fire cascaded from the Myanmar military’s hillside position, striking just outside the house and flashing bright in the midday sun.
A cat left behind by the house’s owners meowed in alarm. Suu Kyi reached down to stroke it. Before COVID, before the coup, before the war, she was to study geography in college. She was to become a teacher. The cat brushed against Suu Kyi, threading her legs in a nervous pattern, then slinked behind sandbags.
“Maybe after we win the revolution, I can continue my life again,” she said. “Maybe not me, but people of my generation.”

Your Fast-Food Favorites, Only Better: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The air smelled of yeast and cheese and weed, and though what I had in front of me looked like a personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut, it was in fact a more expensive dupe.
Some of the original pizza's flaws had been airbrushed and overwritten, as in a favorite childhood memory. No veins of raw dough, no discouraging sweat of vegetable oil.
The best qualities of the original were exaggerated in a buttery, gold-washed bottom and a fine, crackly edge, draped with a light brown confetti of cheese. The puff and fluff of the dough were doubled, bubbly and weightless.
What's hard to explain is why this pizza -- this impostor pizza -- felt more like a Pizza Hut pizza than the source material.
The chef Tim Hollingsworth made it for what he called "Pizza Haute," one of the meticulous themed dinners he cooks at Chain in Los Angeles, a regular pop-up that considers American fast food with an almost scholarly attention, exalting the genre with rigorous cooking and presentation.
Chain doesn't specialize in the forensic trompe l'oeils of fine dining -- those baroque lemon-flavored desserts made to look like real lemons until you cut into them, revealing layers of cream and cake. No, this is pizza disguised as, well, also pizza.
It's a different kind of illusion: a restaurant that isn't really a restaurant, selling fast food that isn't really fast food? And it sent me -- a person who isn't really a person? -- into a spiral. Was Chain celebratory and nostalgic or cynical and manipulative? Was it a marketing stunt, a performance piece or a loving rewrite of our culinary vernacular? Was it an indulgent dip into the past or a glimpse into the future?
Chain's menus change, sometimes mashing together brands into a super-lineup. This particular set meal was $ 75 a person, which got you cocktails in red Solo cups, plenty and possibly even unlimited wine, a relic of a salad bar and an ice cream station stocked with actual blocks of Hunka Chunka PB Fudge and Butter Crunch from Friendly's, flown in from the East Coast.
The actor B.J. Novak dreamed up Chain as a cheffy homage to chain foods. It first popped up in parking lots and alleys in 2021, and was later run out of a house in West Hollywood. In its earliest days, Chain might have seemed like a direct response to the darkness of the pandemic, anticipating the regression of taste that tends to follow very bad news -- that reliable surge in orders for buttered noodles, chicken tenders, macaroni and cheese, ice cream sundaes.
Another way to look at it was Hollywood solving for the risk of the restaurant business, getting a talented chef to adapt existing culinary I.P. -- the McRib, the Crunchwrap Supreme, the Bacon King -- in the way a director might work a film around Barbie.
In January, Chain and its magnificent collection of vintage fast-food tchotchkes moved to a larger space in Virgil Village, where it remains one of the city's hardest tables to land. (Chain has hosted about 100 sold-out events since it started, and the waiting list, which you join by request via text message, is 25,000 names long.)
"We don't like to think of ourselves as a restaurant," said Nicholas Kraft, one of Chain's founders. It's true that it's both more ethereal than a restaurant and more established than a pop-up. And though it's not an Instagram museum, it has the qualities of a fictional corporation's immersive experience.
Ruth De Jong, a production designer who recently worked on "Nope" and "Oppenheimer," helped devise the look, jumbling together a vintage Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders vibe with '90s arcade and video games and slick original design: curvy green lettering and red banquettes, elaborate plastic menus and self-referential poster ads. The effect is both jarring and sumptuous -- a fast-food multiverse that seems to have always existed.
Before going, I worried that Chain would feel like a pantomime, mocking the restaurants it referenced and the people who loved them. But there was a warmth to the place, a clear affection for the subject and its hard-wired pleasures. As I waited for the buzzer I'd been handed to flash, telling me the pizzas were ready to pick up, I gripped it too tightly. The anxiety of missing the notification -- the thrill when it buzzed! -- was all very, very real.
Mr. Hollingsworth used a childhood memory as a reference point for the pizza dinner: the night he was stuck in a Pizza Hut in Houston during a flash flood. But like everyone there, I brought my own set of references. By the end of the night, it felt as if I'd gone to an eccentric billionaire's party for which he'd painstakingly recreated his last birthday from the summer before his parents' divorce. The thoroughness. The precision. The sublimation of heartbreak and longing.
Mr. Hollingsworth has a serious fine-dining background -- he was chef de cuisine at the French Laundry for years and now runs Otium in Los Angeles. But he resists all fussiness -- no miniaturization, no textural transmutation, no construction that would make the dish unrecognizable. This is why it works. The food is chef-driven, technically, but the chef knows how to disappear.
Fancy remakes of fast food aren't new, but they're rarely collaborations assisting the company's own branding efforts. In a mind-bending ouroboros of marketing, Pizza Hut sponsored the pizza dinner at Chain, which doubled as promotion for the company's steak-topped pizza. The food was an ad -- for the food, which was also an ad.
But not all the dishes are sponsored, and so far Chain hasn't provoked any corporate lawyers. For fun, Mr. Hollingsworth recently served a menu he called "The Comeback Combo," inspired by beloved, discontinued stuff. It included beef-tallow fries, reminiscent of the ones McDonald's made until 1990, when the company switched to vegetable oil. He also made a look-alike of the Bell Beefer, a loose-meat sandwich from Taco Bell's early menus.
A recent Instagram post on Chain's account asked followers to chime in with the foods they missed -- retired, hard to find, coming and going with the shifts in our industrially regulated seasons.
People longed for the 7-Layer Burritos at Taco Bell and the actually fried apple pies from McDonald's. They missed Popeyes's Cajun rice, KFC's popcorn chicken, Wendy's stuffed pitas and the Olive Garden's chicken Alfredo pizza.
It was an exercise in audience engagement that surfaced artifacts worth chasing, a look into the past and future. Here was the bottomless breadbasket of ideas, the inexhaustible canon of American chain food, I.P. surviving in a blur of memory and marketing, that could be excavated and remade forever. The nostalgia -- the menus it would write, if you let it -- was boundless.

Ruth De Jong, a production designer who recently worked on “Nope” and “Oppenheimer,” helped devise the look, jumbling together a vintage Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders vibe with ’90s arcade and video games and slick original design: curvy green lettering and red banquettes, elaborate plastic menus and self-referential poster ads. The effect is both jarring and sumptuous — a fast-food multiverse that seems to have always existed.
Before going, I worried that Chain would feel like a pantomime, mocking the restaurants it referenced and the people who loved them. But there was a warmth to the place, a clear affection for the subject and its hard-wired pleasures. As I waited for the buzzer I’d been handed to flash, telling me the pizzas were ready to pick up, I gripped it too tightly. The anxiety of missing the notification — the thrill when it buzzed! — was all very, very real.
Hollingsworth used a childhood memory as a reference point for the pizza dinner: the night he was stuck in a Pizza Hut in Houston during a flash flood. But like everyone there, I brought my own set of references. By the end of the night, it felt as if I’d gone to an eccentric billionaire’s party for which he’d painstakingly re-created his last birthday from the summer before his parents’ divorce. The thoroughness. The precision. The sublimation of heartbreak and longing.
Hollingsworth has a serious fine-dining background — he was chef de cuisine at the French Laundry for years and now runs Otium in Los Angeles. But he resists all fussiness — no miniaturization, no textural transmutation, no construction that would make the dish unrecognizable. This is why it works. The food is chef-driven, technically, but the chef knows how to disappear.
Fancy remakes of fast food aren’t new, but they’re rarely collaborations assisting the company’s own branding efforts. In a mind-bending ouroboros of marketing, Pizza Hut sponsored the pizza dinner at Chain, which doubled as promotion for the company’s steak-topped pizza. The food was an ad — for the food, which was also an ad.
But not all the dishes are sponsored, and so far Chain hasn’t provoked any corporate lawyers. For fun, Hollingsworth recently served a menu he called “The Comeback Combo,” inspired by beloved, discontinued stuff. It included beef-tallow fries, reminiscent of the ones McDonald’s made until 1990, when the company switched to vegetable oil. He also made a look-alike of the Bell Beefer, a loose-meat sandwich from Taco Bell’s early menus.
A recent Instagram post on Chain’s account asked followers to chime in with the foods they missed — retired, hard to find, coming and going with the shifts in our industrially regulated seasons.
People longed for the 7-Layer Burritos at Taco Bell and the actually fried apple pies from McDonald’s. They missed the Cajun rice from Popeyes, KFC’s popcorn chicken, Wendy’s stuffed pitas and the Olive Garden’s chicken Alfredo pizza.
It was an exercise in audience engagement that surfaced artifacts worth chasing, a look into the past and future. Here was the bottomless breadbasket of ideas, the inexhaustible canon of American chain food, IP surviving in a blur of memory and marketing, that could be excavated and remade forever. The nostalgia — the menus it would write, if you let it — was boundless.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the director of salons at Henri Bendel, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue, she spent decades outfitting brides-to-be for their grand ceremonies.
Monica Hickey, who for decades swathed celebrities and socialites for their lavish nuptials in the haute bridal salons at the New York department stores Henri Bendel, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue, died on Jan. 26 in Valle de Elqui, Chile. She was 100.
She died at the home of her daughter, Caitlin Margaret May, who announced the death.
Ms. Hickey ran the bridal boutique at Bendel's under the company's president, Geraldine Stutz, a celebrated figure in fashion retailing, from 1960 until she was hired away by Bergdorf's in 1967 to run a department under her own name, the Bridal World of Monica Hickey.
In 1978, she returned to Bendel's, where for more than a decade she directed the venerable Shop for Brides at the company's flagship on West 57th Street in Manhattan, which had opened in 1908 and was considered an institution. In 1987, Bendel's announced the closing of the shop. The closing followed a takeover of Bendel's by the retailer The Limited two years earlier, which had also led to a move to Fifth Avenue.
"Through the years, the Bendel's bride has been steadfast in one concept," Ms. Hickey said in an interview with The New York Times after the announcement. "Her dress had to be romantic, delicate, in perfect taste, streamlined, never frantic."
Among the prominent brides Ms. Hickey served there were the television host Jane Pauley and three daughters of the auto magnate William Clay Ford.
Over the years, she helped dress a number of other notable brides, including Amanda M. Burden, whose mother was the magazine editor and socialite Babe Paley and who would serve as the New York City planning commission under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; Margaret Lindsay, a daughter of another New York mayor, John V. Lindsay; and Phyllis George, the former Miss America and CBS football host who married John Y. Brown Jr., the Kentucky Fried Chicken mogul who was elected governor of Kentucky in 1979.
She also helped outfit Vera Wang for her 1989 wedding to the stockbroker Arthur Becker. Later a celebrated bridal designer herself, Ms. Wang was then the design director for Ralph Lauren women's accessories and at-home wear.
After Ms. Wang opened her own bridal boutique on Madison Avenue in 1990, she asked Ms. Hickey to run it. Ms. Hickey ultimately declined the offer, although they remained friends.
"She sent a contract for three years," Ms. Hickey recalled on the podcast "Meet the Masters" in 2007. She considered it a "wonderful opportunity," she said, but when she told her husband, Peter Glushanok, a filmmaker and composer, his response was, "Do you want to be a bird in a gilded cage?"
Monica Hickey was born on Nov. 17, 1923, in Glasgow, the youngest of three children of Irish parents, Margaret (Ryan) Hickey, a seamstress, and Patrick Hickey, a typesetter.
Her family frequently moved between cities in Scotland, Northern England and Ireland during her childhood. When she was 14, they settled in London, where she left school to help her mother with her home-based dressmaking business.
Monica first grew enraptured with the world of luxury, her daughter said, during World War II, when she was evacuated from London during the Blitz to the safety of an aristocratic hunting lodge in the countryside.
In 1953, she and her sister, Kathleen, moved to New York to escape the deprivations of war-ravaged England. She eventually found a job as an assistant buyer in the evening dress department at Bendel's. At one point, Ms. Stutz asked her to serve as a temporary fill-in in the bridal department, telling her that "our buyer, that we brought in from Philadelphia, I'm afraid she drinks before she gets here," Ms. Hickey said on the podcast.
After a few months, Ms. Stutz approached her again, apologizing that she had yet to find a replacement. "And I said, 'But you did,"' Ms. Hickey recalled.
While running her boutiques, Ms. Hickey regularly traveled to Europe as a buyer -- and, effectively, as a tastemaker -- scouting for dresses by designers like Karl Lagerfeld, Ursula of Switzerland and the noted British designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel. In 1981, the Emanuels invited Ms. Hickey to the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer to get an up-close look at the explosion of ivory silk taffeta that they had fashioned for the new princess.
At 4-foot-8, Ms. Hickey rarely bothered toting boxes or hoisting elaborate gowns, her daughter said; instead, she relied on her keen eye, honed at the hand of her dressmaker mother, to advise brides on the perfect fit and draping.
She also served as a de facto diplomat, managing the egos of many of her society clients and their mothers. After her final run at Bendel's, she spent more than a decade running the bridal salon at Saks and briefly consulted for Vera Wang and Kleinfeld Bridal. She retired in 2003.
In addition to her daughter, Ms. Hickey is survived by four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Her husband, Mr. Glushanok, died in 1996.
Despite her success, Ms. Hickey faced her share of challenges -- most notably in the late 1960s and early '70s, when couples following a flower-child impulse ditched grand weddings to get hitched on sun-dappled beaches or in bucolic country meadows.
"The girls really didn't want wedding dresses at all," she recalled in a 1997 interview with The Tampa Bay Times. "But most of them succumbed because Grandmother would cut them out of the will if they didn't."

Yum Brands Sales Take Hit Over Gaza Conflict
Yum Brands' quarterly sales missed Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, with weaker growth across its top chains, as fewer customers ordered at Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut amid a choppy spending environment in the United States.
It also joined its rivals McDonald's and Starbucks in taking a sales hit from the Israel-Hamas war.
The company flagged a "low single-digit headwind" to fourth-quarter sales from the conflict that dented business in the Middle East and other markets like Malaysia and Indonesia. The impact should moderate as 2024 progresses, Yum said.
The Middle East, Turkey and North African markets make up about 6 percent of KFC's systemwide sales, while Middle East and Africa account for 5 percent of those at Pizza Hut.
Meanwhile in the United States, inflation-weary consumers have been cutting costs. Reuters

Uber Stock Hits High After Turning First Profit
Uber posted its first full-year profit since going public in 2019 and its stock hit an all-time high Wednesday as strong bookings in the final quarter of the year pushed profit and revenue beyond Wall Street expectations.
Like its final year as a private company, the last time Uber turned a profit, it got a huge tailwind from investments that helped fuel profits, $ 1 billion in 2023. The difference is that Uber has started making money from operations.
"2023 was an inflection point for Uber," said Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive.
Uber has focused on cutting costs and building up a food-delivery division, which has become a major revenue driver. Uber's ride-hailing service has gradually bounced back from a pandemic slump and the numbers from the fourth quarter suggest both are trending in the right direction. Associated Press

Alibaba Offers $ 25 Billion To Buy Back More Shares
Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding on Wednesday approved an additional $ 25 billion authorization to its share buyback program, amid lower-than-expected sales revenue for the last quarter of 2023.
Alibaba posted a 5 percent increase in sales to 260.3 billion yuan ( $ 36.67 billion) for its quarter ended December, slightly missing analyst estimates.
Net income sank to 14.4 billion yuan, down 77 percent compared with the same time last year. The Hangzhou-based firm attributed the drastic drop in net income to the decrease in value of its equity investments and a decrease in income from operations due to that.
Alibaba's New York-listed stock price fell about 4 percent in premarket trading following the report.
"Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing," Alibaba chief executive, Eddie Wu, said. Associated Press

Marlena Shaw, Cabaret Chanteuse Across Eras and Genres, Dies at 84: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She sang jazz (with Count Basie, among others) and later funk and disco, frequently in intimate venues, where she regaled audiences with tales of old love affairs.
Marlena Shaw, who cultivated a sultry stage presence and husky voice from the final echoes of the big-band era to the go-go Playboy Clubs of the 1960s, to the rise of funk, to disco, and finally to the modern cabaret circuit, died on Jan. 19. She was 84.
Her daughter MarLa Bradshaw announced her death on social media but did not provide any further details.
Ms. Shaw first came to public notice in the mid-1960s, when she performed at Playboy Clubs around the country. Describing one of those performances in 1966, The Los Angeles Times labeled her a "pretty girl singer" but also called her "the surprise of the bill." That same year, Jet magazine reported that "three record companies were waving contracts in her face" after a New York engagement.
She signed with Cadet Records, which in 1967 released her recording of "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy," a vocal version of the Joe Zawinul tune that had been a hit for Cannonball Adderley. It reached No. 58 on the Billboard pop chart and 33 on the R&B chart.

It also got the attention of Count Basie, who invited Ms. Shaw to try out for a job singing with his band.
She traveled to Las Vegas for an audition. "I have to admit," she recalled to The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1975, "that when I was first asked to sing with the Count I thought he was dead."
Halfway through one of her songs, Basie walked out. Ms. Shaw was not surprised: She didn't think she had a chance at the job.
Then he reappeared, holding two glasses of Courvoisier. He handed one to Ms. Shaw.
"Don't push the voice," he told her, she recalled to The Inquirer. "Save the pipes; you'll need them tonight."
She sang with his band for several years.
"From Basie I learned that you can put on a good show without having to have a frantic pace going," Ms. Shaw told The San Francisco Examiner in 1977.
She also toured and performed with Sammy Davis Jr., but by the early 1970s she was mainly embarked on a solo career.
She began developing a half-mischievous, half-melancholic style.
The jazz label Blue Note released her album "Who Is This Bitch, Anyway?" in 1975. Its lead track, "You Me and Ethel/Street Walkin' Woman," featured a skit in which Ms. Shaw played a commanding and clever but down-and-out prostitute -- she works, she says slyly, in "social services" -- who gently shakes off a would-be john offering only $ 25. The album's liner notes said that, for her, its songs narrated "some of the scenes I've lived through."
She transformed yet again in 1979 with an up-tempo disco album, "Take a Bite." Although she continued to release albums until 2004, she never made it big as a recording artist. Journalists often noted that she had not garnered the acclaim or celebrity that was once expected of her.
"Marlena Shaw is one of those evergreen performers, a trusty force in jazz even when she isn't at the top of the charts," the jazz critic Josef Woodard concluded in The Los Angeles Times in 2001.
Live performance became the focus of her career. As late as 2003, she worked 175 dates a year. She was inspired to sing gospel after trying out the style on a jazz-themed cruise. She studied how to relate to audiences, regaling them with ribald stories. When she sang "You've Changed," a ballad made famous by Billie Holiday, she reminisced about a cross-dressing boyfriend.
Not everyone enjoyed the shtick. In 1978, the New York Times music critic John Rockwell praised Ms. Shaw's ability to make even "the plainest of songs" into "jazz extravaganzas," but he deplored her use of "the elegantly vulgar sexual miming that is so popular on the supper‐club circuit."
Another Times critic, Stephen Holden, took the opposite view. "Her outstanding skill is an ability to interpolate amusing, semi-improvised commentary within songs, in a variety of musical styles, that turns them into personal testimony," he wrote in 1987.
In 2005, when Ms. Shaw was performing at the Manhattan cabaret Le Jazz Au Bar, Mr. Holden found that her act had retained the kind of appeal it had nearly 20 years earlier.
"She evokes the battle of the sexes, which she suggests is continuing and ultimately hopeless," Mr. Holden wrote. "Her weapon of choice is a voice with the cutting edge of a meat cleaver."
Marlina Burgess was born on Sept. 22, 1939, in New Rochelle, N.Y. She grew up singing in a church choir, and during her girlhood she performed at the Apollo Theater. She hoped to go on tour with her uncle, a trumpeter named Jimmy Burgess, but her mother forbade it. She later adopted Marlena Shaw as a stage name.
One night, when Ms. Shaw was in her 20s, she was at a bowling alley when a girlfriend of hers insisted that she ask the bandleader who was performing there if she could sing. With the courage endowed by two beers, Ms. Shaw put herself forward. She got a job singing at the joint for $ 15 a night.
As of the mid-1970s, she had five children and was married to Ed Boyer, a bassist, but family life did not stop her from touring. "We talk about problems on the phone when I'm on the road," she said about her relationship with her children in a 1977 interview with The Oakland Tribune. "They're very cool about my traveling."
Ms. Shaw lived in Las Vegas for decades. Complete information about survivors was not available.
In recent decades, some of Ms. Shaw's records provided soundtracks to TV commercials and material for sampling, including "California Soul" (which was used by KFC and Dockers) and "Woman of the Ghetto" (which was sampled by Fat Joe and Beenie Man, among others).
Before her death, her birth year had generally been listed as 1942 or 1944, but her daughter wrote in the death announcement that she had actually been born in 1939. On that subject, Ms. Shaw once told The Oakland Tribune that she had learned a lesson from Sammy Davis Jr.: "He taught me to use everything I have onstage; I don't hold anything back, except my age."

Atheist Chaplain Helps Inmate Face Last Hours on Death Row: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "God, that chicken." Devin Moss has a voice that rumbles, low and slow like distant thunder, but this morning it was softer, more contemplative. His hands gripped the steering wheel of his rental car. He was dressed head to toe in white linen, his body glowing in an almost celestial way, as he drove toward the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.
Moss, a chaplain, had spent the year working as the spiritual adviser to Phillip Hancock, a death row inmate in Oklahoma. The morning of the November execution had arrived. The prison had brought Hancock the wrong last meal the night before, white meat from Kentucky Fried Chicken instead of dark.
"That chicken, I know," echoed Sue Hosch, an anti-death penalty activist seated in the passenger seat beside Moss. "I couldn't believe it."
Hancock, convicted of two murders he committed in 2001, was scheduled to be executed at 10 a.m. With three hours to go, his lawyers were still hoping that Oklahoma's governor would grant him clemency, as the state parole board had voted to recommend three weeks earlier.
State lawyers and family members of the victims had continued to push for Hancock's execution. State officials had reminded the parole board that one of the victims was only 38 when he died, and was of "great assistance" to his parents. The death of the other victim, they said, deeply affected his younger brother, who could not sleep after the loss.
Moss was driving to the prison to be with Hancock. After more than a hundred conversations, their relationship -- death row inmate and the man charged with caring for his soul -- had come down to this morning.
Moss thought of the outrage Hancock had shared with him. "The good Christians are going to strap me to a crucifix and put a nail in my vein?" Hancock had asked. "Do they really think that their God approves of them?"
Moss also thought of Hancock's alternately plaintive, sometimes witty quips. When Moss asked, "How are you?" Hancock answered, "I'm still here."
The gray Oklahoma skies opened into a drizzle. Moss wondered what he had to offer Hancock in these final hours, when ordinary wisdom seemed to fail and prayers, in this case, were irrelevant. Heaven, hell, salvation: He had talked about it all with Hancock, but neither of them really believed in anything but people. What humans were capable of doing, for themselves and to one another. Both men were atheists.
There is an adage that says there are no atheists in foxholes -- even skeptics will pray when facing death. But Hancock, in the time leading up to his execution, only became more insistent about his nonbelief. He and his chaplain were both confident that there was no God who might grant last-minute salvation, if only they produced a desperate prayer. They had only one another.
The two spoke at least once a week, and sometimes multiple times a day. Mostly, they talked over the phone, and provided recordings of these conversations to The Times. Sometimes it was in person, in the prison's fluorescently lit visitor room, over bags of Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
During their visit the day before his execution, Hancock had seemed mostly fixated on his final meal, that one bucket of dark meat chicken.
Moss stopped his car in front of the three-story building on the prison grounds where he would spend the next hours waiting. He got out and stood still for a moment. He considered the possibility that Hancock had hope for survival, not through divine intervention but through the state's. Gov. Kevin Stitt -- who two years ago said he claimed "every square inch" of Oklahoma for Jesus Christ -- could still grant clemency. He had just under three hours.
But if the hour of death came to pass, what would the chaplain do? Moss felt viscerally the absence of any higher power on the prison compound that morning.
"It's well known that people that really believe, that really have faith, die better," he said. "How can we help people die better that don't have supernatural faith?"
The opposite path
In prison, they have a name for people who find God after they are locked up: "Jailhouse Jesus." History is rife with examples including, famously, Malcolm X, who found faith in prison and left to be a minister of the Nation of Islam.
Scholars who examine the phenomenon find that in prison, faith can be a comfort. People are searching for a new identity beyond "criminal," a sense of empowerment, the vocabulary to ask for forgiveness and the feeling of control over their future. Religion answers all these calls: The new identity is that of a convert. The power is in being an agent of God. The route to forgiveness runs through belief, or proselytizing. And past sins become just steps on the path to God.
Hancock, 59, had the opposite path. He had entered prison as a Christian, with an appetite for reading, learning and debate that he shared with many imprisoned believers. Along the way, he became an atheist.
As a child, in Oklahoma City, he went with his parents to a Methodist Church. He and his friends often left services and went to a nearby car salvage lot to smoke weed and cigarettes. In the summer, Hancock went to a Baptist Bible school, where he recalled being judged for his family's freewheeling religious practices.
"They'd inform me why all the Methodists were going to burn in hell, because we smoke, we drink, we dance, we're impious and profane and we lie, cheat, steal," Hancock said in an interview with The Times. "We're just all abominate."
Hancock frequently felt his faith was being tested. When he was a child, according to his own memories and those of his mother, the two of them fled home to escape Hancock's father, now dead, who they said was physically abusive.
Hancock's younger brother, David Craig, was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, leaving him with cerebral palsy. Hancock cared for his little brother and recalled getting into fights when older boys taunted him. Sometimes, Hancock said he looked at the crucifix in his bedroom and wondered if his faith was misplaced.
Still, in 2001, Hancock called himself a Christian. He wasn't devout, but he was a believer.
One night in late April of that year, according to case documents, Hancock went to the home of Robert Lee Jett Jr. Jett had been supplying drugs to Hancock's then girlfriend, who was staying with Jett while she and Hancock were fighting over her drug use.
Hancock and Jett got into an argument, along with Jett's friend, James Vincent Lynch. During the dispute, Hancock wrested away Jett's pistol. He then shot and killed both men. After killing them, Hancock evaded capture for a year, until he was booked into the county jail on an unrelated charge.
At the time of the killings, Hancock attributed his survival to God.
"This is something that my stepdad used to tell me -- he used to say, 'God knows what you need before you need it,"' Hancock said during a phone call in May with Moss. "I walked out of the house thinking God had intervened on my behalf to deliver me from the hands of violent men."
During Hancock's trial, prosecutors argued that he did not commit the murders in self-defense. Hancock fired multiple shots, at a distance from the two men. Hancock had also been convicted of manslaughter in 1982, when he shot an acquaintance in a dispute. In that case, he also claimed the shooting was in self-defense and served just under three years in prison.
In 2004, an Oklahoma jury found Hancock guilty of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced him to death.
Hancock entered Oklahoma State Penitentiary, or Big Mac, as it is known. The maximum security prison is set on 1,556 acres in McAlester, with more than 800 people housed in a sprawling white structure surrounded by fences topped by double strands of razor wire. It serves as a backdrop to the opening pages of "The Grapes of Wrath," and it is where some 206 people have been executed since 1915.
In prison, Hancock started to receive visits from missionaries, a common occurrence. He met proselytizers who told him they had personally raised people from the dead, or witnessed mass graves come back to life, which Hancock called "hooey and hokum."
He started to view these proselytizing visitors as insurance agents, selling insurance not for life but for the afterlife. "We've got a special this month on afterlife insurance," Hancock liked to joke.
Hancock began reading ravenously so that he could debate the missionaries. He read the Bible, often quoting stories that depict God as violent, like that of the vengeance on the Midianites. He read "Bible Myths and Their Parallels in Other Religions," which debunks biblical stories. He particularly enjoyed "A Manual for Creating Atheists," by the philosopher Peter Boghossian.
Over his early years in prison, Hancock had come to feel abandoned by God.
Then, in 2007, a court denied the appeal of his death sentence. Hancock had a revelation: "I decided, it makes more sense to me to hate a God that does not exist than to be slave to one," he said. "The weight of the world came off of me. Because I wasn't concerned about this maniacal, narcissistic, omnicidal psychopath."
He began to embrace the thrill of cross-examining visiting missionaries. "I force them through gentle persuasion, through the Socratic method, to make them question for themselves why they believe what they think that they believe," he said.
He said he took care, though, to argue with empathy. He did not want to destroy what he called a "delusion" that these missionaries might need on their own deathbeds.
But for Hancock, coming to identify as an atheist brought a difficult question: What could sustain him day by day -- through rage and grief and fear of his looming execution -- without faith in a power mightier than the people who had decided to end his life?
Memento Mori
The chaplain, Moss, 48, grew up in Hailey, Idaho, and jokes that he was born with an existential crisis: Instead of coming out of the womb saying "wah," he came out saying "why?"
His parents tried to raise him to be devout. He went to a private Christian school, part of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God. At school, in the 1980s, Moss and his classmates participated in rapture drills, akin to earthquake or fire drills. A teacher blew a whistle, one child ran to get a drum kit and another got a recorder, and then the class played worship songs.
Constantly curious, Moss started asking thorny questions about biblical tales like the story of Jonah and the whale. "Wait, so he lived in the belly of the whale?" Moss asked. "I don't know if that's possible? And for how many days?"
Adrift after high school, Moss joined the Marines. During boot camp, he took Catholic confirmation classes because they gave him an excuse to get away from his drill sergeants.
Later, in a film degree program at the University of Texas at Austin, he wrote scripts about existentialism. He studied Friedrich Nietzsche, Baruch Spinoza, Joseph Campbell and Buddhist philosophers. He realized the existentialists made more sense to him than the Christian teachings of his youth. And he eventually concluded that he did not believe in God, though he still sought a sense of spiritual purpose.
He decided to make a podcast about spirituality and death called "The Adventures of Memento Mori," referring to the Latin phrase: "Remember you must die." During a podcast interview, a Buddhist chaplain, the Rev. Trudi Jinpu Hirsch-Abramson, told Moss: "You'd make a good chaplain."
The remark stuck with him. He learned that there was a theological seminary in Chicago launching a new program for humanists. Moss enrolled at the Meadville Lombard Theological School in 2019, taking classes on ethics, Buddhism and creating inclusive communities. He did a residency as a chaplain at Bellevue Hospital in New York during the pandemic and graduated in June 2022.
He did not know what kind of job a freshly graduated atheist chaplain could land. But the opportunity arrived quickly when the American Humanist Association heard from a team of lawyers whose client on death row in Oklahoma wanted a chaplain who did not believe in God.
"Hello sir. How are you doing?" Moss wrote in a letter to Hancock in early 2023. "It would be an honor to be by your side in spiritual support for these next months -- be it a prayer, meditation, an existential ponder, a cry and even a joke. I want you to know that you are not alone."
Moss included his phone number in the letter so that Hancock could reach him. The calls were recorded, as a robotic voice announced at the beginning, and capped at 20 minutes.
During one of their first calls together, last February, Hancock explained to his new spiritual adviser the conundrum that he faced: "I want more than anything to believe in something other than this," Hancock said. "I just can't do it though, lacking evidence."
'Show me something real'
It was clear to Moss that his spiritual care client was seething with frustration at his sentence.
"I tend to get adrenaline rushes when I think about this because I'm so angry," Hancock told Moss in February 2023. "They've stolen my life from me."
Hancock shared with his chaplain some of the poems and songs he turned to for comfort, like the poem "If" by Rudyard Kipling ("If you can keep your head when all about you / Are losing theirs and blaming it on you") and a song by Slipknot that includes the line, "Everybody has to die."
"Everybody does die," Moss agreed. "But you're different in the sense that there's a day on the calendar."
Hancock was adamant about the way he wanted to face his death. "If it comes down to it, I'm maintaining my dignity," he said. "I'll make them ashamed to be scared when it's their turn to die. They'll say, 'We've got to hold our heads high, like Hancock."'
Hancock had one request of his spiritual adviser. It was drawn from a set of Bible verses, Philippians 4:7-8.
"Show me something real," he said to Moss. "Tell me something true."
As Hancock shared stories from his childhood, Moss tried to get a sense of his character. "Were you the class clown growing up at all?" he once asked.
"I'm reluctant to sit here and say what I am or how I am," Hancock replied. "Because usually when people tell you that they're a certain way, a lot of times they're not."
Sometimes they discussed philosophy; Hancock liked to quote Plato, Pyrrho and Buddhist thinkers. ("Everything's 'maybe' with the Buddhists; it seems like it all boils down to 'maybe,"' Hancock said, to which Moss replied: "It's a wise maybe.") They explored biblical stories -- Noah's flood, Cain and Abel, Samson and Delilah.
"What's interesting, Phil, is how much the Bible and Christianity and the Old Testament influences you," Moss said.
"That stuff is ancient wisdom that was commandeered by people with less than innocent intent," Hancock replied.
From time to time, Moss wondered aloud what exactly Hancock was seeking in these meandering discussions: "Why did you feel it was necessary to get a spiritual care adviser for this part of your life?"
Hancock explained that his initial motive was simple. Because of a Supreme Court ruling in 2022, which said death row inmates had the right to be with their spiritual advisers during the execution, Moss would be able to be in the execution chamber.
Hancock wanted someone by his side to ensure nothing went awry. He talked worriedly about Oklahoma's 2014 botched execution of Clayton Lockett, who after his injections began to writhe, declaring that his body felt like it was "on fire." He had a heart attack in the execution chamber.
Hancock said he liked the idea of having Moss next to him at the end. "You're a wonderful person, as far as I can tell," he said. "I mean, you're absolutely charming. I like you man. You're a nice person. I think you're sincere."
When their phone conversations drifted into retracing Hancock's legal case, Moss tried to push them back into the realm of the spiritual. "I want to see if there are opportunities and areas that you find peace or joy or some sort of light," Moss said. "Is there anything?"
Hancock explained that he found a sense of purpose in his battle for clemency, for survival. "I'm not done yet, like I said -- I love life," he said. "I'm going to fight to the bitter end of this."
"It's exactly what Virgil said to Dante," Hancock said. "In order to get out of this, you have to go through it."
Moss began visiting in person starting in July. The two sat together, with Hancock's friend Hosch, the anti-death penalty activist, for four hours in the visitation room, surrounded by other inmates spending time with their wives and children.
Moss felt like he had spent months swimming in Hancock's pain and anger, but sitting opposite one another was different -- taking in Hancock's skinny frame, draped in a maroon prison jumpsuit, his head covered in scars and his nose that had been broken in several places. Their laughter felt more genuine when they were just inches apart.
Hancock was touched that Moss had flown from Brooklyn to McAlester to see him. Hancock explained that after their first visit, wondering how he appeared in person to his chaplain, he had been thinking about a lyric from the Butthole Surfers: "You never know just how you look through other people's eyes."
Moss stopped feeling so anxious about what he was offering Hancock. He listened, as Hancock ate vending machine cheeseburgers and drank cans of Mountain Dew. It became clear to Moss that Hancock did not believe in God, but he did believe in what people can do for each other. He seemed to believe, in particular, in the relationship he was building with Moss.
In August, Moss decided that he would sublet his Brooklyn apartment and move to Oklahoma for the month leading up to the execution so that he could visit the prison more easily. The time they spent together in person felt more human -- the eye contact, the stretches of time uninhibited by the 20-minute phone limit.
"Hey Devin, man, you're blowing me away," Hancock said when he heard about the chaplain's plans. "You're showing me something I haven't seen from -- I don't recall anybody really coming through like this."
They kept revisiting the legal case, too, because Hancock and his lawyers were busy preparing for a clemency hearing when they would ask the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board to consider new evidence that Hancock had acted in self-defense. They presented testimony from Hancock's ex-girlfriend that she had asked Jett to "take care of" Hancock.
The state argued he still deserved the death penalty. "Hancock is before you now, over two decades on from the double murder of Jett and Lynch, still asserting his legal innocence, still claiming he acted in self-defense," the office of the attorney general wrote to the board. "But the evidence doesn't back that up."
State officials said that Hancock's actions during and after the murders conflicted with his claim that he acted in self-defense and feared for his life. They noted that he "calmly drove away from the scene" and did not go to a doctor or call the police.
"The losses of Robert Jett Jr., and James Lynch were a tragic setback to both their families," lawyers for the state said.
Still, the board voted, 3-2, to recommend clemency. Gov. Stitt would make the final decision, and he had up until the scheduled hour of the execution to respond.
Moss worried that recordings of his phone conversations with Hancock might influence the ultimate decision; all the tape could be available to the governor, who attends an Assemblies of God church (the same denomination that Moss was raised in). Moss voiced his concern to Hancock, but both felt they did not want fear to confine their discussions.
Moss sometimes posed deeper, cerebral questions, the sort he had initially envisioned that he would explore as a chaplain, like where humans should find their moral compass.
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," Hancock said in a mid-November phone call, explaining his view of ethics with a biblical passage. "That's it in a nutshell. That's it. You don't have to have all these other things, you don't have to believe in certain things -- that God has been and always will be."
"What do you think happens when a person dies?" Moss asked another time.
Hancock assured his chaplain he found morsels of comfort in his nonbelief. "Nonexistence didn't bother me before I existed," he said. "I don't think it's going to bother me after I'm dead."
The final visit
The execution was set for Nov. 30 at 10 a.m.
The night before, Moss ironed his white pants and white shirt. If the execution went forward -- and it still was not clear that it would -- he wanted to look like a spiritual authority while standing at Hancock's side. He wanted Hancock to understand he had a buddy with him, but that it was also a person who had a deeper role to play, someone who had touched his soul.
That morning, Moss wrote out in a notebook what he planned to say to Hancock in their final minutes together. Hancock, no longer able to make phone calls, was in his cell listening to music from the heavy metal band Slayer, one of his favorites.
Moss arrived at the prison at 7:35 and entered the room where he would wait for a decision from the governor. The minutes moved in a torturous crawl. Soon it was 8:30, then it was 9 a.m. The lawyers and prison staff were waiting together, some making small talk about the rain.
Around 10:10, an aide for the governor called. The execution was to move forward, quickly. Over on death row, the inmates gave Hancock a send-off -- kicking their doors and filling the prison with the rumbling sound of a makeshift goodbye.
Because of the delay, Moss had to cut short his final minutes with Hancock. He had been told that they would be together for 20 minutes, but instead they got only about 10. "Phil's been shorted again," he thought, remembering the fried chicken.
Moss was shuttled to H-unit, where the execution chamber was located. He entered the sparse room where Hancock lay strapped to a gurney, wearing a gray shirt and with a white sheet covering the lower half of his body. Moss was struck by how tiny the space was, and the tightness of the straps slung over the gurney.
He rested a hand on Hancock's knee and recited the words that he had written in his notebook: "We call the spirit of humanity into this space," Moss said. "Let love fill our hearts. We ask that in this transition into peaceful oblivion that Phil feels that love, and although this is his journey that he is not alone. We invoke the power of peace, strength, grace and surrender. Amen."
He thanked Hancock for the knowledge he had shared -- the expansive vocabulary, the expertise on scripture and religion and, of course, the endless jokes, of which about seven out of 10 had landed. "Seven?" Hancock interrupted, tilting his head up. "Out of 10?"
"Man," said the prison's chief of operations, who was standing nearby with another corrections officer. "That's a pretty good percentage."
Moss turned to his final words for Hancock. "In the beginning of this, when I asked what you really wanted out of a spiritual care adviser, it was Philippians chapter 4," he said. "Show me something real, show me something true."
Moss looked at the face he had come to know well. "What is real is that you are loved," he told his friend. "What is true is you are not alone."
The curtain in front of Hancock's gurney rose at 11:13, revealing the witnesses -- Hosch, two of Hancock's lawyers, the state's attorney general and an official from his office, as well as five members of the media, who provided a detailed account of the execution.
Hancock said, jokingly: "Where my enemies at?"
To Moss, his voice was the same as always, buzzing with energy. It was time for his final words. He thanked his legal team and told the attorney general, who was seated in the front row with his legs crossed, that he had been "hoodwinked." He told his witnesses that he had acted in self-defense, and still hoped to be exonerated after his death.
"I don't want anyone out there crying for me," he added, addressing Hosch: "You, Sue -- I don't want you doing that."
At 11:15, Hancock was given a three-drug lethal injection: midazolam for sedation, vecuronium bromide to halt respiration and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. As his eyes closed and his chest rose and fell, liquid moving through the I.V., Moss stood at his feet, hoping his friend could hear him. "You are loved," Moss said over and over. "You are not alone."
At 11:23, Hancock was unconscious. When his chest stopped moving and his face appeared to lose color, the prison doctor called his name, listened to his heart, opened both his eyes and inspected them under a light. At 11:29, Hancock was pronounced dead.
After death
Even after all the words they had exchanged, about existence and mortality and human cruelty, Moss hadn't been prepared for the finality of this moment. The conversation between the two had seemed, sometimes, as though it would never end; there were no conclusions, only more threads to unspool.
Looking at Hancock's body, Moss surprised himself by murmuring a spontaneous prayer, which came out involuntarily, like a sneeze. He prayed that whatever came next for Hancock, that he would be dealt a better set of cards.
The families of the victims, Jett and Lynch, spoke in the prison's media room right afterward. "I am grateful that justice has been served according to God's will," said Lynch's niece, reading a message from her mother. "I can only hope that he chose to get his soul right with God before his window of opportunity closed for eternity."
Outside the execution chamber, the drizzle had turned into sheets of rain. Moss sat in his car and began to cry.
In his hand was the paper where he had written down his final message to Hancock. There were the instructions he had written to himself: "Call the spirit of humanity into this space." And there was a sentence fragment he'd crossed out, following the word spirit: "Of the divine."
Moss had gone back and forth on how to approach those last moments. He knew he wanted his final words to his friend to honor what both of them believed to be true, as he said driving away from the prison: "God has nothing to do with this."

MCALESTER, Okla. — “God, that chicken.” Devin Moss has a voice that rumbles, low and slow like distant thunder, but this morning it was softer, more contemplative. His hands gripped the steering wheel of his rental car. He was dressed head to toe in white linen, his body glowing in an almost celestial way, as he drove toward the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.
Moss, a chaplain, had spent the year working as the spiritual adviser to Phillip Hancock, a death row inmate in Oklahoma. The morning of the November execution had arrived. The prison had brought Hancock the wrong last meal the night before, white meat from KFC instead of dark.
“That chicken, I know,” echoed Sue Hosch, an anti-death penalty activist seated in the passenger seat beside Moss. “I couldn’t believe it.”
Hancock, convicted of two murders he committed in 2001, was scheduled to be executed at 10 a.m. With three hours to go, his lawyers were still hoping that Oklahoma’s governor would grant him clemency, as the state parole board had voted to recommend three weeks earlier.
State lawyers and family members of the victims had continued to push for Hancock’s execution. State officials had reminded the parole board that one of the victims was only 38 when he died, and was of “great assistance” to his parents. The death of the other victim, they said, deeply affected his younger brother.
Moss was driving to the prison to be with Hancock. After more than 100 conversations, their relationship — death row inmate and the man charged with caring for his soul — had come down to this morning.
Moss thought of the outrage Hancock had shared with him. “The good Christians are going to strap me to a crucifix and put a nail in my vein?” Hancock had asked. “Do they really think that their God approves of them?”
The gray Oklahoma skies opened into a drizzle. Moss wondered what he had to offer Hancock in these final hours, when ordinary wisdom seemed to fail and prayers, in this case, were irrelevant. Heaven, hell, salvation: He had talked about it all with Hancock, but neither of them really believed in anything but people. What humans were capable of doing, for themselves and to one another. Both men were atheists.
Moss stopped his car in front of the three-story building on the prison grounds where he would spend the next hours waiting. He got out and stood still for a moment. He considered the possibility that Hancock had hope for survival, not through divine intervention but through the state’s. Gov. Kevin Stitt — who two years ago said he claimed “every square inch” of Oklahoma for Jesus Christ — could still grant clemency. He had just under three hours.
But if the hour of death came to pass, what would the chaplain do? Moss felt viscerally the absence of any higher power on the prison compound that morning.
“It’s well known that people that really believe, that really have faith, die better,” he said. “How can we help people die better that don’t have supernatural faith?”
In prison, they have a name for people who find God after they are locked up: “Jailhouse Jesus.” History is rife with examples including, famously, Malcolm X, who found faith in prison and left to be a minister of the Nation of Islam.
Scholars who examine the phenomenon find that in prison, faith can be a comfort. People are searching for a new identity beyond “criminal,” a sense of empowerment, the vocabulary to ask for forgiveness and the feeling of control over their future. Religion answers all these calls: The new identity is that of a convert. The power is in being an agent of God. The route to forgiveness runs through belief, or proselytizing. And past sins become just steps on the path to God.
Hancock, 59, had the opposite path. He had entered prison as a Christian, with an appetite for reading, learning and debate that he shared with many imprisoned believers. Along the way, he became an atheist.
As a child, in Oklahoma City, he went with his parents to a Methodist Church. He and his friends often left services and went to a nearby car salvage lot to smoke weed and cigarettes. In the summer, Hancock went to a Baptist Bible school, where he recalled being judged for his family’s freewheeling religious practices.
Still, in 2001, Hancock called himself a Christian. He wasn’t devout, but he was a believer.
One night in late April of that year, according to case documents, Hancock went to the home of Robert Lee Jett Jr. Jett had been supplying drugs to Hancock’s then girlfriend, who was staying with Jett while she and Hancock were fighting over her drug use.
Hancock and Jett got into an argument, along with Jett’s friend, James Vincent Lynch. During the dispute, Hancock wrested away Jett’s pistol. He then shot and killed both men. After killing them, Hancock evaded capture for a year, until he was booked into the county jail on an unrelated charge.
At the time of the killings, Hancock attributed his survival to God.
“This is something that my stepdad used to tell me — he used to say, ‘God knows what you need before you need it,’” Hancock said during a phone call in May with Moss. “I walked out of the house thinking God had intervened on my behalf to deliver me from the hands of violent men.”
During Hancock’s trial, prosecutors argued that he did not commit the murders in self-defense. Hancock fired multiple shots, at a distance from the two men. Hancock had also been convicted of manslaughter in 1982, when he shot an acquaintance in a dispute. In that case, he also claimed the shooting was in self-defense and served just under three years in prison.
In 2004, an Oklahoma jury found Hancock guilty of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced him to death.
Over his early years in prison, Hancock had come to feel abandoned by God.
Then, in 2007, a court denied the appeal of his death sentence. Hancock had a revelation: “I decided, it makes more sense to me to hate a God that does not exist than to be slave to one,” he said. “The weight of the world came off of me. Because I wasn’t concerned about this maniacal, narcissistic, omnicidal psychopath.”
It was clear to Moss that his spiritual care client was seething with frustration at his sentence.
“I tend to get adrenaline rushes when I think about this because I’m so angry,” Hancock told Moss in February 2023. “They’ve stolen my life from me.”
Hancock had one request of his spiritual adviser. It was drawn from a set of Bible verses, Philippians 4:7-8.
“Show me something real,” he said to Moss. “Tell me something true.”
Sometimes they discussed philosophy; Hancock liked to quote Plato, Pyrrho and Buddhist thinkers. (“Everything’s ‘maybe’ with the Buddhists; it seems like it all boils down to ‘maybe,’” Hancock said, to which Moss replied: “It’s a wise maybe.”) They explored biblical stories — Noah’s flood, Cain and Abel, Samson and Delilah.
“What’s interesting, Phil, is how much the Bible and Christianity and the Old Testament influences you,” Moss said.

Moss began visiting in person starting in July. The two sat together, with Hancock’s friend Hosch, the anti-death penalty activist, for four hours in the visitation room, surrounded by other inmates spending time with their wives and children.
Moss felt like he had spent months swimming in Hancock’s pain and anger, but sitting opposite one another was different — taking in Hancock’s skinny frame, draped in a maroon prison jumpsuit, his head covered in scars and his nose that had been broken in several places. Their laughter felt more genuine when they were just inches apart.

They kept revisiting the legal case, too, because Hancock and his lawyers were busy preparing for a clemency hearing when they would ask the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board to consider new evidence that Hancock had acted in self-defense. They presented testimony from Hancock’s ex-girlfriend that she had asked Jett to “take care of” Hancock.
The state argued he still deserved the death penalty. “Hancock is before you now, over two decades on from the double murder of Jett and Lynch, still asserting his legal innocence, still claiming he acted in self-defense,” the office of the attorney general wrote to the board. “But the evidence doesn’t back that up.”
Still, the board voted 3-2 to recommend clemency. Stitt would make the final decision, and he had up until the scheduled hour of the execution to respond.
The execution was set for Nov. 30 at 10 a.m.
The night before, Moss ironed his white pants and white shirt. If the execution went forward, he wanted to look like a spiritual authority while standing at Hancock’s side. He wanted Hancock to understand he had a buddy with him, but that it was also a person who had a deeper role to play, someone who had touched his soul.
That morning, Moss wrote out in a notebook what he planned to say to Hancock in their final minutes together. Hancock was in his cell listening to music from the heavy metal band Slayer.
Moss arrived at the prison at 7:35 and entered the room where he would wait for a decision from the governor. The minutes moved in a torturous crawl. Soon it was 8:30, then it was 9 a.m. The lawyers and prison staff were waiting together.
About 10:10, an aide for the governor called. The execution was to move forward, quickly.
Because of the delay, Moss had to cut short his final minutes with Hancock. He had been told that they would be together for 20 minutes, but instead they got only about 10. “Phil’s been shorted again,” he thought, remembering the fried chicken.
Moss was shuttled to H-unit, where the execution chamber was located. He entered the sparse room where Hancock lay strapped to a gurney, wearing a gray shirt and with a white sheet covering the lower half of his body. Moss was struck by how tiny the space was, and the tightness of the straps slung over the gurney.
At 11:15, Hancock was given a three-drug lethal injection: midazolam for sedation, vecuronium bromide to halt respiration and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. As his eyes closed and his chest rose and fell, liquid moving through the IV, Moss stood at his feet, hoping his friend could hear him. “You are loved,” Moss said over and over. “You are not alone.”
At 11:23, Hancock was unconscious. When his chest stopped moving and his face appeared to lose color, the prison doctor called his name, listened to his heart, opened both his eyes and inspected them under a light. At 11:29, Hancock was pronounced dead.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Hot Glazed Doughnuts on the Menu: For Parisians, How Sweet It Is: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As dawn broke in central Paris on Wednesday, a throng of 500 people, mostly French, stood with uncharacteristic patience in a snaking line, intent on buying a decidedly un-French confection: an American doughnut. A hot, glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut, to be exact.
It was the grand opening of the chain in France, and patrons -- dozens of whom had camped out overnight -- watched through a giant window as a conveyor belt ferried fried dough toward a waterfall of sugary frosting. When the doors opened, they swarmed inside, ordering doughnuts by the dozen to take out, or noshing at bistro tables in a cafe-style setting.
"The French love American products, and there's a hype around American food chains," said Amir Boudokhane, 25, a project manager at a medical clinic, as he waited to get in. A Krispy Kreme ad had popped up on his Instagram feed, and he rushed to get there before work. "I'll be late," he said with a smile. "But at least I'll have doughnuts for my colleagues."
The sight of French people flocking to American fare might have seemed surreal a generation ago in a country that loves its Michelin-starred restaurants, three-hour dinners and iconic baguette. But today, the world's gastronomic capital happens to be one of the biggest markets in Europe for major American fast-food chains, as evolving consumer habits, influenced by a more casual younger generation and social media, reshape the dining landscape.
In the spring, Popeye's fried chicken drew huge crowds in Paris when it opened the first of 350 restaurants planned across France. Wendy's has announced plans to set up shop in France. Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Domino's Pizza, Chipotle, Steak 'n Shake, Carl's Jr. and Five Guys have long had toeholds, but they are rapidly expanding their footprints with plans for hundreds of new locations across the country.
Leading the pack is McDonald's. After the United States, France is the chain's most profitable country, with more than 6 billion euros ( $ 6.5 billion) in sales from over 1,500 restaurants in 2022. France is also the second-biggest market for Burger King, with €1.2 billion in revenue last year.
"France is an El Dorado for American fast-food brands," said Xavier Expilly, a consultant who helped oversee the French openings of Burger King, Five Guys and others. "Habits are shifting -- people are eating faster than before, and they want a different experience," he noted. "The American chains know how to respond to that need perfectly."
Krispy Kreme is the latest. At the opening on Wednesday, a D.J. thumped out dance music to the waiting crowd. A red carpet adorned the entrance, while the company's mascot -- a doughnut -- bobbled alongside workers handing out fresh glazed goodies to eager patrons.
Miguel Calic-Cuere spent the night in front of the store with dozens of fans eager to secure a good place in line. "I hardly slept because it was so cold," said the 20-year-old student, who kept warm by taking short walks and making friends in the growing crowd. Waiting for the opening "was a moment of solidarity for all of us," he exclaimed. When the doors finally opened, he found himself the lucky winner of a free box of a dozen Krispy Kremes each month for the next year.
Celia Lea Amarouche, 19, and Marie Besson, 28, were ready to open their wallets after seeing Krispy Kreme cameos in American TV shows that they had watched to improve their English, including "The Simpsons" and popular crime shows. Seeing Kylie Jenner dig into Krispy Kreme doughnuts on TikTok sealed the deal, Ms. Besson said.
"Doughnuts are little known in France compared to croissants and pain au chocolat," said Alexandre Maizoué, the director general of Krispy Kreme France and a member of the executive committee of Wagram Finance, a French private-equity firm backing the company's venture. He gestured around the store, where people crowded around five counters, picking out chocolate frosted doughnuts with sprinkles, or a dozen glazed in strawberry pink.
"This is all about American pop culture," he said. Krispy Kreme "appeals to Generation Netflix," he added. "They've seen all the American series. They like U.S. culture and the American art de vivre."
Doughnuts rolled off an assembly line that had been imported from North Carolina, where the chain is based. New flavors were created to appeal to the French palate, including a fresher fruit taste for the apple doughnut and less sweetness to the strawberry frosting. One Frenchified version was loaded with gingerbread, a cookie often served with an espresso at cafes.
The store, in a premium spot that Krispy Kreme took over from the French Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse, will make 45,000 doughnuts a day. A dozen more sites will open in Paris in the next three months, Mr. Maizoué said, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts will be sold at dozens of French supermarkets.
Things were not always smooth for American brands in France: Burger King was forced to pull out of the French market before re-entering a decade ago, after it insisted on sticking with a burger menu that was too American for French tastes. McDonald's, by contrast, catered some offerings to the French market by introducing add-on items not in its U.S. restaurants, like croissants and a facsimile of the croque-monsieur sandwich.
McDonald's also set a standard by creating a sit-down restaurant atmosphere that made French consumers steeped in cafe culture feel more comfortable about gathering at a table around a Big Mac. It also uses French-sourced meats, cheeses and breads.
Other American fast-food chains have adopted that same model to survive -- and thrive, Mr. Expilly said. "Sales in France are two to three times higher than in other countries because companies have modified that ultrafast American dining experience," he said.
French food isn't about to be knocked from its perch: The No. 1 lunch counter is still the local bakery. About 2.6 billion baguette sandwiches are sold each year in France, compared with 1.4 billion hamburgers, according to Gira Conseil, a French consultancy.
But in terms of sheer earning power, American chains dominate, making up nearly 30 percent of all fast-food sales, a broad category that includes rapid-service restaurants. The top five American fast-food companies in France had €8.6 billion in sales last year, according to Xerfi, a Paris-based research firm.
By all accounts, there is more money to be made. American chains are expanding abroad because saturation levels in the United States have reached record highs, said Aaron Allen, founder and chief strategist of Aaron Allen & Associates, a Chicago-based consultancy that focuses on the global food service and hospitality industry.
"The U.S. brands have battled it out, and there's only so many places to put them," he said. "So you see a rush to get to those countries where norms are changing and there's more acceptance of fast food."
That is the case in France, where the younger generation is more casual than its parents were and regular mealtimes at home have splintered. Hourlong sit-down lunches have morphed into shorter breaks that send people looking for a faster alternative.
And the use of food delivery services like UberEats and Deliveroo exploded during the pandemic, fueling a penchant among young people to order in with the tap of an app -- a phenomenon that didn't exist in France a decade ago.
Back at Krispy Kreme, Michele Fidel and Charlie Anglo, who work at a luxury hotel in Paris, had rushed to the opening after seeing friends post about it on Facebook. "We'd been praying that Krispy Kreme would come here!" Mr. Anglo exclaimed.

PARIS — As dawn broke in central Paris on Wednesday, a throng of 500 people, mostly French, stood with uncharacteristic patience in a snaking line, intent on buying a decidedly un-French confection: an American doughnut. A hot, glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut, to be exact.
It was the grand opening of the chain in France, and patrons — dozens of whom had camped out overnight — watched through a giant window as a conveyor belt ferried fried dough toward a waterfall of sugary frosting. When the doors opened, they swarmed inside, ordering doughnuts by the dozen to take out, or noshing at bistro tables in a cafe-style setting.
“The French love American products, and there’s a hype around American food chains,” said Amir Boudokhane, 25, a project manager at a medical clinic, as he waited to get in. A Krispy Kreme ad had popped up on his Instagram feed, and he rushed to get there before work. “I’ll be late,” he said, smiling. “But at least I’ll have doughnuts for my colleagues.”
The sight of French people flocking to American fare might have seemed surreal a generation ago in a country that loves its Michelin-starred restaurants, three-hour dinners and iconic baguette. But today, the world’s gastronomic capital happens to be one of the biggest markets in Europe for major American fast-food chains, as evolving consumer habits, influenced by a more casual younger generation and social media, reshape the dining landscape.
In the spring, Popeye’s fried chicken drew huge crowds in Paris when it opened the first of 350 restaurants planned across France. Wendy’s has announced plans to set up shop in France. Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Domino’s Pizza, Chipotle, Steak ’n Shake, Carl’s Jr. and Five Guys have long had toeholds, but they are rapidly expanding their footprints with plans for hundreds of new locations across the country.
Leading the pack is McDonald’s. After the United States, France is the chain’s most profitable country, with more than 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in sales from over 1,500 restaurants in 2022. France is also the second-biggest market for Burger King, with 1.2 billion euros in revenue last year.
“France is an El Dorado for American fast-food brands,” said Xavier Expilly, a consultant who helped oversee the French openings of Burger King, Five Guys and others. “Habits are shifting — people are eating faster than before, and they want a different experience,” he noted. “The American chains know how to respond to that need perfectly.”
Krispy Kreme is the latest. At the opening on Wednesday, a DJ thumped out dance music to the waiting crowd. A red carpet adorned the entrance, while the company’s mascot — a doughnut — bobbled alongside workers handing out fresh glazed goodies to eager patrons.
Miguel Calic-Cuere spent the night in front of the store with dozens of fans eager to secure a good place in line. “I hardly slept because it was so cold,” said the 20-year-old student, who kept warm by taking short walks and making friends in the growing crowd. Waiting for the opening “was a moment of solidarity for all of us,” he exclaimed. When the doors finally opened, he found himself the lucky winner of a free box of a dozen Krispy Kremes each month for the next year.
Celia Lea Amarouche, 19, and Marie Besson, 28, were ready to open their wallets after seeing Krispy Kreme cameos in American TV shows that they had watched to improve their English, including “The Simpsons” and popular crime shows. Seeing Kylie Jenner dig into Krispy Kreme doughnuts on TikTok sealed the deal, Besson said.
“Doughnuts are little known in France compared to croissants and pain au chocolat,” said Alexandre Maizoué, the director-general of Krispy Kreme France and a member of the executive committee of Wagram Finance, a French private-equity firm backing the company’s venture. He gestured around the store, where people crowded around five counters, picking out chocolate frosted doughnuts with sprinkles, or a dozen glazed in strawberry pink.
“This is all about American pop culture,” he said. Krispy Kreme “appeals to Generation Netflix,” he added. “They’ve seen all the American series. They like U.S. culture and the American art de vivre.”
Doughnuts rolled off an assembly line that had been imported from North Carolina, where the chain is based. New flavors were created to appeal to the French palate, including a fresher fruit taste for the apple doughnut and less sweetness to the strawberry frosting. One Frenchified version was loaded with gingerbread, a cookie often served with an espresso at cafes.
The store, in a premium spot that Krispy Kreme took over from French Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse, will make 45,000 doughnuts a day. A dozen more sites will open in Paris in the next three months, Maizoué said, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts will be sold at dozens of French supermarkets.
Things were not always smooth for American brands in France: Burger King was forced to pull out of the French market before re-entering a decade ago, after it insisted on sticking with a burger menu that was too American for French tastes. McDonald’s, by contrast, catered some offerings to the French market by introducing add-on items not in its U.S. restaurants, like croissants and a facsimile of the croque-monsieur sandwich.
McDonald’s also set a standard by creating a sit-down restaurant atmosphere that made French consumers steeped in cafe culture feel more comfortable about gathering at a table around a Big Mac. It also uses French-sourced meats, cheeses and breads.
Other American fast-food chains have adopted that same model to survive — and thrive, Expilly said. “Sales in France are two to three times higher than in other countries because companies have modified that ultrafast American dining experience,” he said.
French food isn’t about to be knocked from its perch: The No. 1 lunch counter is still the local bakery. About 2.6 billion baguette sandwiches are sold each year in France, compared with 1.4 billion hamburgers, according to Gira Conseil, a French consultancy.
But in terms of sheer earning power, American chains dominate, making up nearly 30% of all fast-food sales, a broad category that includes rapid-service restaurants. The top five American fast-food companies in France had 8.6 billion euros in sales last year, according to Xerfi, a Paris-based research firm.
By all accounts, there is more money to be made. American chains are expanding abroad because saturation levels in the United States have reached record highs, said Aaron Allen, founder and chief strategist of Aaron Allen & Associates, a Chicago-based consultancy that focuses on the global food service and hospitality industry.

METROPOLITAN
An article last weekend in which a writer details his experience arriving in New York City as one of 140,000 Jewish refugees who fled postwar Europe misstated the number of days that asylum seekers must wait before applying for a work permit. It is 150 days, not 180, though a permit will not be granted before 180 days after an asylum seeker has arrived. The article also misidentified the U.S.S. General A.W. Greely. It was a Navy vessel when the author and his family arrived in New York City on March 3, 1950, not a merchant marine vessel.
REAL ESTATE
The Living In feature last Sunday misidentified the location of Brooklyn Heights Montessori School. It is in Boerum Hill, not Brooklyn Heights.
MAGAZINE
An article on Page 36 this weekend about the recent antitrust actions against the chicken suppliers industry by the Department of Justice misstates the profits that suppliers to Kentucky Fried Chicken would have made on 400 million pounds of chicken if they had increased their prices by 10 cents per pound. It is $ 40 million, not $ 4 billion.
An article on Page 40 this weekend about Las Vegas's Punk Rock Museum misquotes the zine writer Aaron Cometbus. He described the musician Mike Burkett as "Trump with a mohawk," not "Trump in a mohawk."
A roundtable interview on Nov. 26 about the Oslo peace process misstated the affiliation of an observer mission in the West Bank city of Hebron. It was a multinational civilian group, not a U.N. mission.
An article on Nov. 19 about homelessness in San Francisco misidentified a California jail. Santa Rita is a county jail that also holds federal prisoners, not a federal prison.
BOOK REVIEW
The paperback nonfiction best-­seller list last Sunday referred incorrectly to Paul McCartney's book "The Lyrics." Unlike the hardcover edition, the paperback is one volume, not two volumes, and it features the lyrics to 161 songs, not 154.

NATIONAL
An article on Friday about how complicated it can be for American presidents to balance their relationships with foreign allies misstated the title of Narendra Modi, the leader of India. He is the prime minister, not the president.
An article on Tuesday about the solar energy manufacturing sector's struggle to balance supply with demand misstated the focus of Maxeon Solar Technologies. Maxeon is engaged in cell fabrication and module manufacturing, it does not deploy or install solar panels.
METROPOLITAN
An article last weekend in which a writer detailed his experience arriving in New York City as one of 140,000 Jewish refugees who fled postwar Europe misstated the number of days that present-day asylum seekers must wait before applying for a work permit. It is 150 days, not 180, though a permit will not be granted before 180 days after an asylum seeker has arrived. The article also misidentified the U.S.S. General A.W. Greely. It was a Navy vessel when the author and his family arrived in New York City on March 3, 1950, not a merchant marine vessel.
BUSINESS
An article on Monday about resolving a flight cancellation issue with Frontier Airlines referred incorrectly to the amount that Frontier Airlines refunded the traveler. The airline refunded the entire $ 939.75 amount, including the $ 99.99 membership fee, not simply the flight costs.
ARTS
An article on Nov. 18 about places to visit on the back roads of Southern California omitted information about the California Oil Museum, in Santa Paula. It temporarily closed in September 2021 because of financial hardships related to the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to reopen. The city of Santa Paula has agreed to buy the museum and is exploring options to help reopen it.
An article on Monday about how professional athletes are increasingly becoming serious art collectors referred incorrectly to the artist Swoon. She is not Black.
MAGAZINE
An article on Page 36 this weekend about the recent antitrust actions against the chicken suppliers industry by the Justice Department misstates the profits that suppliers to Kentucky Fried Chicken would have made on 400 million pounds of chicken if they had increased their prices by 10 cents per pound.

T: TRAVEL
An article on Nov. 12 about a Graff necklace misattributed a quote about the patience and effort it takes to coordinate stones in the company's high jewelry pieces. The quote was from Francois Graff, the company's C.E.O., not Laurence Graff, its founder.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Friday about the photographer Larry Fink misidentified the museum that exhibited his collection "Social Graces" in 1979. It was the Museum of Modern Art, not the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Would You Like Fries With That Outfit?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Jeremy Scott had just started interviewing for the job of creative director at Moschino when he had an epiphany of sorts while driving through Los Angeles.
"I saw the iconic McDonald's logo," Mr. Scott said, "and it just hit me: Moschino, McDonald's."
"I've always been very much about pop culture," he added.
He got the job at Moschino not long after, and he then began to work with its graphics team to contort the fast-food chain's golden arches into the shape of a heart, a signature motif of the Italian fashion brand.
Mr. Scott, who left Moschino this year, delved deeper into McDonald's visual cues while designing his first collection for the label, which was shown in early 2014. It included jackets, skirts and a robe in reds and yellows; a handbag shaped like Happy Meal packaging; and a cellphone case that looked like a carton of French fries with the golden arches-inspired heart on it.
"Whether it's McDonald's or Mickey Mouse or Madonna," he said, "to take any icon that's so understood globally and then twist it -- that's what makes the message go so long and loud."
"Who doesn't like French fries?" Mr. Scott, now 48, added.
His collection raised some eyebrows at McDonald's because he had not received the company's permission to rework its logo. "It was an act of rebellion and we were going by the seat of our pants," he said. But in a deal reached after the runway show, McDonald's gave Moschino permission to use certain graphics in exchange for a donation to Ronald McDonald House Charities.
That Moschino collection was far from McDonald's first association with the fashion world. In the 1970s, children's clothing designed in partnership with McDonald's was sold at Sears and other department stores. Later, the designer Jean Paul Gaultier created a futuristic McDonald's uniform for the 1997 film "The Fifth Element," and the model Kate Moss wore a makeshift uniform while grilling burgers in a 2003 video by the artist Tom Sachs for W magazine.
But Mr. Scott's initial Moschino collection "spurred a new wave of creativity, fun and risk taking at McDonald's," said Morgan Flatley, the company's global chief marketing officer and head of new business ventures.
Other buzzy labels have since embraced the aesthetics of McDonald's, which has also sought out more collaborations with fashion brands. Jennifer DelVecchio, the fast-food chain's senior director of global brand, content and culture, said that "the intention around fashion has really picked up a lot of pace over the last three to five years," adding that "we are looking to meet our fans through the things they love."
This month, McDonald's announced its latest apparel collaboration: a line of Crocs clogs (starting at $ 70), some of which resemble the McDonald's characters Birdie, Hamburglar and Grimace. The collection, which follows Crocs's partnerships with Balenciaga and Kentucky Fried Chicken, will be sold online.
Heidi Cooley, the chief marketing officer at Crocs, said the footwear taps into the nostalgia people have for McDonald's characters. She added that Crocs and McDonald's both "have fans that get tattoos of our iconic products."
In August, the skate brand Palace released a 15-piece collection designed with McDonald's that included clothing and a $ 60 skateboard deck emblazoned with an M. Other labels that have recently collaborated with McDonald's include Cactus Jack, which was started by Travis Scott, and Cactus Plant Flea Market, which last year made toy figurines of McDonald's characters for a special Happy Meal and a corresponding line of sweatshirts, sweatpants and T-shirts.
At a Vetements men's wear show in 2019, some models held McDonald's fries in their hands as they walked the runway -- which was staged inside a McDonald's on the Champs-Élysées in Paris that Vetements had rented for the event.
"I remember sitting in a Starbucks, brainstorming where to do the next spring-summer show, when I looked at the iced coffee in my hand, thinking McDonald's," Guram Gvasalia, a founder and the creative director of Vetements, said in an email. "The night before, after going out, we ended up at McDonald's on Champs-Élysées as it was the only place that was open that late, and I still had the aftertaste in my mouth. That moment I knew it was the right place for the next show."
"McDonald's is an incredible brand," said Mr. Gvasalia, 38. "It's the Louis Vuitton of food. You see it everywhere when you travel, and your heart warms up, as you know what to expect when you go in."
Jimi Vain, 25, a founder of the Finnish streetwear brand Vain, which collaborated with McDonald's on clothing last year, also mentioned the company's global footprint as a reason he was drawn to working with it. During his childhood in northern Finland, he said, "McDonald's was one of the few things in our view of the street that was from overseas."
Mr. Vain said that Vain's collaboration was initiated by the Finnish marketing division of McDonald's. "They needed to get more employees and wanted us to make McDonald's seem like a cool place to work," he said. The project involved using materials from old McDonald's uniforms to design new ones, which were presented during a runway show at a McDonald's in Helsinki last November and later offered to company employees in Finland.
Vain was paid a fee by McDonald's, which also covered the costs to produce the runway show and the clothes. Roope Reinola, Vain's other founder, said the brand received lots of gift cards for fast food as well. "We ate way too much," he said.
Mr. Reinola, 25, added that Vain did not have total creative freedom over the collaboration. After a photo of fries in a black McDonald's carton was posted to Vain's Instagram, he said, emails came in almost immediately "saying that you can't do that."
Jeremy Scott said he also faced resistance from McDonald's when he incorporated its branding into some accessories he had designed for a 2017 Moschino collection inspired by garbage. "The morning after the show, they said they thought it was disgusting that they were associated with trash," he said. Those accessories were never sold, he added.
There is another rule that collaborators with McDonald's are expected to abide by, Ms. DelVecchio said: "The golden arches must remain golden."

Full text: In April 2020, a new force in Irish music announced herself with a song about love, loss and fried chicken.
The video for "Another Day (KFC)," CMAT's debut single, opens with the singer dancing cheerfully in front of a blue screen. "Baby give me something else to do," she sings, in a style pitched between country twang and '60s pop, "I cried in KFC again over you." Then, suddenly, the camera swerves to a dark room where the man this song is addressed to sits gagged and tied to a chair. CMAT, still grinning, dances over and slaps him in the face, then eats a bucket of chicken while sitting on his lap.
Since the video came out, CMAT -- an acronym for the 27-year-old artist's name, Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson -- has become a huge star in Ireland and won fans further afield with country-pop songs that are irreverent, vulnerable, sad, smart -- and decidedly strange.
Her 2022 debut album, "If My Wife New I'd Be Dead," went straight to No. 1 in Ireland, and was awarded the RTE Choice Music Prize, Ireland's equivalent to the Grammys. A follow-up, with another grammatically wayward name, "Crazymad, For Me," arrives Friday, and she has tour dates scheduled in Ireland, Britain and the United States.
The connection between Ireland and country music is longstanding: The "singing cowboy" Gene Autry toured the country in the '30s, and the genre was further popularized in the '60s by groups known as showbands that played in rural dance halls. In the '90s, Garth Brooks's stadium gigs in Dublin triggered a nationwide craze for line dancing. CMAT brings this tradition up-to-date, combining the enduring country themes of heartbreak and self-destruction with camp humor and a distinctly Irish sense of the absurd.
"I think the structure of everything I do is probably always going to come from country music," Thompson said in a recent interview. "I'm always going to sing like a country singer."
"Crazymad, For Me," however, also branches into psychedelia, anthemic pop and rock 'n' roll. For this album, Thompson said, she "wanted to make something that sounded very theatrical," like Meat Loaf's "Bat Out of Hell."
The Meatloaf influence is clear in the slow-burning, claustrophobic ballad "Rent" which builds to a rock 'n' roll chorus with a spiraling piano line and howling vocals -- but there is also "Have Fun," a pop anthem showcasing an Irish fiddle.
Mattias Tellez, the album's producer, said Thompson's voice was "timeless, and powerful, and so distinct," displaying "qualities I hear in the likes of Billie Holiday, or Ella Fitzgerald -- that power, and control, and spontaneous humor."
The new album draws on Thompson's life, looking back on a tumultuous relationship the singer began with an older man when she was in her late teens. It follows her from her lowest and messiest point, before she reckons with the past and decides to move on.
Along the way, she weaves in references to St. Anthony (the finder of lost things -- a favorite of Irish mothers), Miranda from "Sex and the City" and the "Wagatha Christie" trial that recently gripped Britain's tabloids.
The single "Where Are Your Kids Tonight?" sees CMAT collaborate with the singer-songwriter John Grant. The two appeared onstage together in September, at Dublin's National Concert Hall, where Grant was performing a concert of Patsy Cline covers. CMAT was the guest star, singing "Walkin' After Midnight" and "She's Got You."
In an email, Grant said working with Thompson was "a blast."
"They absolutely love her in Ireland, and with good reason," Grant said. "Looks like the rest of the world is catching on."
CMAT began her career describing herself online, ironically, as "a global pop star" who "lives in Dublin with her grandparents." Prepandemic, she was working in a cafe: She had no money, and was recovering from a period of depression and disillusionment, after the band she'd formed at 18, Bad Sea, failed to gain traction and split.
She reinvented herself as a solo act, self-releasing singles including "I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!" and "Nashville," a dreamy (and surprisingly exhilarating) song about suicidal ideation. She rapidly gained fans, in particular among young Irish L.G.B.T.Q. people. (Thompson, who is bisexual, once told an interviewer that she's "making music for the girls and the gays, and that's it.")
Her career took off just in time for Covid-19 to rule out the chance of touring. "Everyone was stuck at home, and had nothing to do, and didn't know how to exist on the internet," she said. "But I did, because I'd been there. I'd spent a lot of time in a room by myself."
As a teenager, Thompson was an avid Tumblr user, and wrote fan fiction about Bombay Bicycle Club, an English indie band. She focused on building her own online following, with live streamed events including "CMAT's Very Nice Christmas," and the "CMAT Confessional Line," during which fans called in with life dilemmas for her to solve.
Thompson has since swapped Dublin for Brighton, England, and has reached a point of success where the "pop star" line is no longer a joke. She has even won the recognition of her idols: On the track "So Lonely" she asked "Who needs God, when I have Robbie Williams?," attracting the online attention of the man himself. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Williams called the duet with Grant "majestic."
"Now I am actually kind of living like a pop star," Thompson said. "And now, trying to keep up the pop star thing, and having a fake life, and a fake personality to go with it, just feels wrong." Instead, she is steadily cultivating a unique brand of anti-glamour, appearing in videos in clown costumes, elaborate wigs and male drag, or with facial prosthetics, bleached eyebrows and gems stuck to her teeth.
The intimacy she has forged with fans has only intensified: Recently, Thompson promised on X that if "Crazymad" reaches the Top 10 in Britain, she would send her wisdom teeth, freshly removed, to a lucky follower.
In the same spirit of authenticity, the album shows its creator's flaws, as well as her triumphs. "When I was making this record, two things happened," Thompson said. "I got angrier about some things, but then I also realized that I had done some things wrong in my life." Across its 12 tracks, the album shifts from blaming her ex to forgiving herself for her own mistakes.
"I feel like no one is trying to make themselves look bad anymore in their music," she added, "but we've all done things wrong in our lives. I'm an embarrassing person who's done some very embarrassing things."
The album's ecstatic final tracks, "Have Fun" and "Stay For Something," complete this journey from resentment to regret, through self-acceptance to, ultimately, optimism.
"There's no point in suffering," Thompson said. "You could just have been having a good time. Because life is very short."

Full text: The company sure didn't when it was developing its mutant cowboy boots, the brand's latest attempt to create a wearable meme.
John Wayne never dreamed of this kind of ventilation.
A pair of cowboy boots was unveiled on Thursday by Crocs, the footwear brand best known for aesthetically questionable clogs that combine the composition of a pool noodle with the perforation of Swiss cheese.
The new boots make regular Crocs look like dress shoes. Picture a pair of the clogs rendered in a glossy, black crocodile-skin texture. Then add the top half of a cowboy boot, complete with pull straps and hokey embroidery. Then add spurs.
"I did a little bit of a double take," said Steve Natto, 25, a sneaker YouTuber in Philadelphia, when he saw the shoes on Instagram on Thursday.
That was most likely the goal for Crocs, a brand that has courted attention and outrage online through a series of bizarre shoe releases. There were the KFC chicken-scented Crocs in 2020 and the high-heeled Crocs, created in collaboration with Balenciaga, in 2021. Just last month, the company released chartreuse Shrek Crocs with ears.
The cowboy boots, which go on sale on Oct. 23 for $ 120 a pair, also follow in the footsteps of the Big Red Boots created by the smart-alecky collective MSCHF -- another stunt item that was hailed as an ironic masterpiece online.
Will customers find the Crocs cowboy boots similarly hilarious? Or have they begun to tire of the viral footwear shtick?
"I think there's definitely going to be a market for it," said Mr. Natto, who was among the first to clomp around in the MSCHF boots on social media. Although he couldn't imagine wearing the boots to run errands, he said, he would certainly post in them.
The idea for Crocs cowboy boots came from memes made by fans on social media, according to Heidi Cooley, the company's chief marketing officer. The brand's design and product development teams met in January to discuss ideas they had seen floating around online, and hoped to select one to release during the month the company has christened "Croctober."
As soon as the cowboy boot idea came up, it was game over. "That meeting took us about 12 minutes," Ms. Cooley said.
The design team got to work, fine-tuning the decorative stitching and suggesting a detachable spur. When a fan has a funny idea, she added, "we don't overthink it."
Crocs exploded in popularity in the early months of the pandemic, when comfort took precedence over stylishness for many customers. The brand's sales have remained strong in recent years, and the company has cultivated a following among Gen Z customers.
Ms. Cooley said the company's marketing team was aware that even its tamest products are polarizing. All the more reason to dive headfirst into meme culture, she said, and to design novelty products to generate conversation.
"It is disruptive, and it allows Crocs to leverage what we believe is a competitive advantage," she said. "We love creating things that nobody thinks we can."
She declined to say how many cowboy boots would be manufactured. The team had been surprised in the past by higher-than-expected demand for some of its novelty products, she said.
Many apparel brands would risk undermining their credibility with a stream of gag products, said Jared Watson, an assistant professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business. But Crocs has found a way to poke fun at people who already think the shoes are ugly. "With that sort of mentality of hate-consumption or hate-engagement, Crocs has had this opportunity to really push those boundaries," he said.
Crocs may also be trying to capitalize on a recent wave of interest in western apparel. Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour this summer was packed with cowboy hats decorated to look like disco balls. In the audience for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, cowboy boots tapped along with the pop star's early-career country hits.
Still, some frontiers are too wild even for the most passionate of Crocs fans.
Professor Watson, who owns three pairs of classic Crocs, recently joined an online waiting list to buy the Shrek clogs. But he bailed at the last second, struggling to imagine the shoes working as well offscreen.
"I will not wear those in public," he said. "I don't want people to think I'm a weird person."

Nine Stylish Friedkin Films To Stream: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The director specialized in grimy thrillers and social dramas that occasionally courted controversy.
An iconoclast even among his New Hollywood peers coming up in the 1970s, the director William Friedkin built a reputation for grimy, high-impact thrillers and social dramas that sought to get a rise out of audiences and frequently drew the controversy they courted.
Friedkin, who died Monday at 87, found early success in Hollywood with the one-two punch of "The French Connection" in 1971 and "The Exorcist" in 1973, but his fortunes shifted in the years that followed, which led to a career of unpredictable and often attention-grabbing swerves. One of his best '80s films, the sleek thriller "To Live and Die in L.A.," is currently unavailable to stream, but adventurous home viewers will find plenty of scorching work to command their attention.
Here are nine films that illustrate Friedkin's combination of stylistic bravado and willingness to engage on the battlegrounds of race, religion, sexuality and systemic corruption.
'The Boys in the Band'
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV and Vudu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Though Friedkin's relationship with the queer community would turn fraught a decade later with "Cruising," this adaptation of Mart Crowley's 1968 Off Broadway play was, at the time, the rare American film to focus entirely (and sympathetically) on the lives of gay men. Friedkin was so impressed by the stage production that all the original cast members were brought into the movie, which takes place mostly in the Upper East Side apartment where a fitfully employed writer (Kenneth Nelson) is holding a birthday party and has invited a motley group of friends. The boozy affair that follows zings with filthy one-liners, but tensions rise as the night carries on and the inner lives of these alienated, often closeted men start to surface.
'The French Connection'
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV and Vudu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Friedkin won his only Oscar, for best director, for this ferociously entertaining policier, which remains one of the great New York movies, a seedy snapshot of the city as it once existed -- at least through the jaundiced perspective of a detective who has his share of blind spots. With a style that's simultaneously propulsive and documentarylike in its evocation of place, Friedkin details a heroin smuggling operation that's making its way to New York from Marseilles via ocean liner. Standing in the way is Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman), a bigot and an alcoholic who's willing to go to astonishing lengths to solve the case, including a car chase under an elevated train that Friedkin turned into a classic of its kind.
'The Exorcist'
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Any conversation about the scariest movies ever made usually starts with a mention of Friedkin's demon possession thriller, but the film's effectiveness involves more than Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells" and the terrifying contortions of a young girl's body and spirit. "The Exorcist" gains an equal amount of power from the unyielding love a mother (Ellen Burstyn) has for her 12-year-old daughter (Linda Blair) as a demon wrests the girl away from her. Once the Roman Catholic Church gets involved, "The Exorcist" builds to harrowing and often frantic sessions between a priest (a superb Max von Sydow) and the ancient evil he's desperate to whisk away.
'Sorcerer'
Rent it on Amazon and Apple TV.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
After huge back-to-back hits with "The French Connection" and "The Exorcist," Friedkin adapted the same French novel that Henri-Georges Clouzot had turned into "The Wages of Fear," a suspense classic about desperate workers driving truckloads of nitroglycerin through a mountain pass. After a troubled and expensive production, "Sorcerer" was a box office failure -- coming out the same summer as "Star Wars" didn't help -- but it's now regarded as one of Friedkin's best, playing to his strengths in location shooting and intense physical action. Roy Scheider leads an international cast as one of four outlaws who accept $ 10,000 and legal citizenship for the job of driving nitroglycerin on hazardous South American roads to an oil well 200 miles away.
'Cruising'
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Friedkin had a habit of courting controversy, but nothing on the level of "Cruising," a crime thriller that gay rights activists protested vociferously during and after production for a portrait of West Village nightlife they felt stigmatized their community. With that caveat in mind, it's still one for the time capsule, a sleazy yet compelling story about a serial killer who targets gay men in New York's leather scene and a detective (Al Pacino) who goes deep undercover to solve the case. It's an understatement to say that Friedkin does not approach the material with the sensitivity his doubters might have wished for, but the locations have an almost tactile griminess to them, and Pacino's performance roils with inner torment.
'Blue Chips'
Stream it on Amazon Prime and Paramount+. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Working from a script by Ron Shelton, who'd made the superb sports comedies "Bull Durham" and "White Men Can't Jump," Friedkin tackled the seedy underbelly of college athletics with typical verve, including dramatized basketball action that's on par with the real thing. Channeling the chair-whipping tempestuousness of Bobby Knight -- who appears as an opposing coach in a cameo -- Nick Nolte stars as a legendary college coach who's starting to miss out on "blue chip" recruits. After his first losing season, he risks his reputation and his conscience by deploying school boosters to offer benefits to top prospects, including a rim-rattling center played by future Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal.
'The Hunted'
Stream it on Max. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In what would turn out to be his last major studio production, Friedkin executed this drum-tight, underrated action thriller in the "Rambo" mode about a disillusioned warrior on a killing spree and the former mentor tasked with bringing him to justice. Benicio Del Toro stars as a highly trained Delta Force soldier so traumatized by the genocide of civilians in Kosovo that he takes to the American wilderness and starts gunning down hunters. Echoing his performance in "The Fugitive," Tommy Lee Jones is the F.B.I. "deep-woods tracker" who tries to retrieve him, with the advantage (and disadvantage) of having taught him everything he knows.
'Bug'
Stream it on Pluto TV. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the first of two straight collaborations with the playwright Tracy Letts, Friedkin doesn't hide the stage roots of a drama that takes place mostly within a rundown Oklahoma motel room, but the feverishness of the camera and sound work, along with the two lead performances, have a strong cinematic intensity. "Bug" is also a vital early showcase for Michael Shannon, who projects enough charisma as a drifter to win over a waitress (Ashley Judd) with relationship problems, but soon reveals a frightening volatility. The supposed discovery of an aphid in the motel bed sends these two lonely people into a paranoid frenzy that Friedkin transforms into an alternate reality.
'Killer Joe'
Stream it on Pluto TV. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Deploying his relaxed, mellifluous Southern drawl to sinister purposes, Matthew McConaughey channels Robert Mitchum in Letts's bracing redneck noir about a trailer-park murder scheme in West Texas that goes sideways. In a plot that owes a little something to "Double Indemnity," Emile Hirsch plays a wayward 22-year-old who enlists his father (Thomas Haden Church) in a plan to kill his mother and split her $ 50,000 life insurance policy, but when they hire a cop/contract killer (McConaughey) to do the job, he requires Hirsch's virginal sister (Juno Temple) to serve as human collateral on future payment. A sequence involving a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken may be the least appetizing product placement in history.

TEASER: Pitbull on Tony Robbins
HED: Pitbull's Path to Motivational Speaking
Tony Robbins was my mother's superhero. When she would take me to school, she'd always play Tony Robbins. I wasn't trying to listen to Tony Robbins. I was trying to listen to 2 Live Crew, N.W.A and Poison Clan. But there was one story subliminally that always stuck in my mind that Tony Robbins was speaking about, which was Colonel Sanders and how many times it took him to sell that recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken. It took him more than 1,000 times. So in my mind as a kid, I'm like, you keep trying.
That always stayed in my mind. Boom, fast forward, I was utilizing that same mentality of music. Everywhere I was going, there was no, no, no way. It's stupid. It's impossible. So I just kept going, kept going, kept going until somebody finally didn't necessarily believe in me or my talents. They believed in my hustle, they believed in my grind, they believed in my work ethic.
So as my career starts to get to a whole other level now, it's a global career, I somehow, some way get connected to Tony Robbins. I speak to him about my story and what he meant to my mother and how he's been a part of my life by default.
We become good friends, business partners, he's a mentor. And then he said, "What do you think about speaking at one of these engagements that I have?" I said, "I would love to." And we tried it -- I loved it. And he gave me the thumbs up. And that's basically what opened the door for speaking engagements. I'm a big believer in the law of attraction. I don't like people with negative. I ain't trying to hear all that. Victims, I don't want to hear that. I want to hear how we're going to figure this out. No problems. Just solutions.
TEASER:Is Hip-Hop Lying About Its Age?
HED: Is Hip-Hop Really Only 50?
Boots Riley: I must have been in third grade or something when we were hearing Sugarhill Gang. This is in Oakland, and I had just recently moved from Detroit, and there was somebody else that was from the Midwest, too. He turned to me and said, "There's a hambone song on the radio." I knew exactly what he was saying. Hambone was something that my older brother and his friends would do, where they're slapping, making a beat -- very much like later people just beat on tables in the cafeteria -- and they're rapping against each other. It was all about jokes and saying stuff that rhymed that was insulting the other person.
In Detroit, the Black population there is mainly from the South. When that record hit the world, Black people didn't say, what is this newfangled thing? I mean, of course everyone loved it, but it was something that existed. I'm usually saying hip-hop started in Congo Square in New Orleans in the 1800s. There's this record of prison recordings from the '40s, '50s and '60s called "Get Your Ass in the Water and Swim Like Me." Like, you listen to the Pigmeat Markham song from the '60s, "Here Come the Judge," and it sounded just like Sugarhill Gang. We don't talk about any other music like it was invented, right? It's always an outgrowth of something.
There are other things too. When I was hanging out in Newark in the late '90s, they were telling me about this thing that was a big thing in Newark, which was to flip on mattresses to music. There was so much trash that had been piled up in the '70s, that it became almost a sport, a thing where people would flip to the music. You see it show up in Lauryn Hill's line "Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress." Basically that was like their breaking.
What I saw happening in the early '90s that I only could kind of articulate later was there were a bunch of people going to universities that were rappers in the '70s and '80s and were defining it, saying this is when it started, this is how it happened. And then writers came out of those universities and started talking about it in those terms.
TEASER: DMC on Public Enemy
HED: DMC's Fateful Run-In With Public Enemy at Dapper Dan's
I didn't care about the money starting out. I just put it all in the bank. To this day I can only speculate how much money I made, but my biggest purchase back then -- it had to be 1988, I bought a $ 50,000 sound system for my monster truck that you could hear from 50 blocks. The infamous story is I'm coming over the Triborough Bridge because I'm headed to Dapper Dan's. As soon as I get off the bridge from Queens at 1st Ave., right there on 125th Street, Dapper Dan's is five flights up. Everybody would go to Dapper Dan's -- Mike Tyson, Eric B. & Rakim, Salt-N-Pepa. But on that day Chuck D and Hank Shocklee were there, and as I'm driving up, the ground and the walls start shaking.
People are coming out all the stores like, what the hell? Is it an earthquake? Nah, it's DMC in his K5 Chevy Blazer souped up like a Hulk monster truck, and I'm blasting Public Enemy's "Don't Believe the Hype." I pull up and Chuck and Hank come out. What was important about that moment is P.E. was unsure if they should release "Don't Believe the Hype" as their next single. So here's DMC, the King of Rock, pulling up in this monster truck blasting a $ 50,000 sound system. They come out and they look at each other. The God, DMC, just gave them the verification that they should release "Don't Believe the Hype."
But here's what's crazy about that. This $ 50,000 sound system was so ahead of its time that it never worked. After that the whole system blew out. So every Thanksgiving and every birthday I would go to my mother and father's house. Until the day my father passed away everybody would be festive and getting their drink on, and he would hit the glass and announce, "Let me tell you what my son Darryl did. This guy bought a $ 50,000 sound system that never worked!" And everybody would just laugh and get on me about that.
But I never really cared about the money. Now when I get asked, "DMC, is there anything about money you would tell the young DMC back then?" my advice is I wouldn't have never spent so much money on drugs.
TEASER: Krayzie Bone on Kurtis Blow
HED: Is That ... Kurtis Blow at the Lemonade Stand?
Krayzie Bone: I'm real cool with Kurtis Blow. I came up listening to Kurtis Blow, so for me to be able to get him on the line any time I want to, that's crazy. We was first coming out, like, after our second album -- this is like '97, '98. We had like little apartments in Los Angeles. And a lot of celebrities used to stay in this apartment complex. We pull up one day, and we see Kurtis Blow out here with his son. So we pulled through the gate, right up on his spot, trippin'. His little son had a lemonade stand and Kurtis Blow said, "I'm trying to teach him business right now." You know what I'm saying? "Man! Kurtis Blow, what's up?" He like, "Oh, what's up Bone?" He knew who we was and everything. We jump out the car, you know what I'm saying? We dapped up and we was like, "Man, you live here?" He was like, "Yeah, I stay here." And we like, started like kicking it with him, going to his house. He would come to our apartment and we just built a bond with him, and we been knowing him ever since then.
TEASER: Jay-Z Joins the Revolution
HED: How Jay-Z Joined dead prez's Revolution
stic: We were working on our "Revolutionary but Gangsta" album and this writer, she got our demo. She wasn't really supposed to have it, but she had it. She was working on a project with Jay-Z, and while she would be at his crib, she was playing "Hell Yeah" so much. Jay didn't know who we was, he just knew he'd been liking the song. So one day he goes, "Yo, I like that pizza song." And she goes, "You don't know nothing about that," yadda yadda. And then he's like, "You think they'll do something with me and let me get on that with them?" But when she told us and asked us, we were like, "Jay-Z? Hell yeah!" No pun intended. Like, that's Jay-Z.
He just went in the lab and knocked it out and sent it back to us. We done worked with a lot of the greats -- you know, Nas, you name it -- but working with Jay was so perfect. Just the integrity he showed. Like not only did he jump right on what he said he was gonna do, but when he was finished with it, he was like, "Do y'all like it? Do you need me to change anything?" And then he signed the paperwork and gave it to us.
He wasn't on no funny nothing. He was like, y'all can have that. And that helped us leverage a situation, you know, because free and clear, we had ownership of a Jay-Z verse in our negotiation. That was some real boss [expletive] that he did that he ain't have to do.
TEASER: Lil Bibby on Juice WRLD
HED: Juice WRLD (1998-2019), Rap's Rock Superstar
Lil Bibby: Juice's mom didn't let him listen to rap. So he listened to all these rock bands. A lot of those bands I don't even know! He listened to the Fall Out Boys. Then graduated into rap, so he had those rock melodies and mixed it with rap.
From the beginning I saw how he was able to record. I think he's probably the best recording artist that I ever seen. He could do like four songs in one take. Ju' was just a superstar. He never really cared what nobody thought of him, he never really tried too hard. He never really thought about his image -- he just was him. Just exuded confidence. You know how most artists try to get attention? It was just everything natural.
TEASER: Vanilla Ice on MC Hammer
HED: The End of the MC Hammer-Vanilla Ice Alliance
Vanilla Ice: You have to understand, hip-hop had gone through these phases of starting off really cheesy. It wasn't cool, it wasn't gangster. And then it became gangster. Then a commercial rapper comes along and changes the game: MC Hammer.
I had played a few shows with Hammer. We became friends. He was a good guy. I saw him and he says, "Hey, man, I'm doing this tour and I want to bring you out as an opening act."
This is right when "To the Extreme" came out, and the phenomenon just lit on fire, like, with gasoline. So every interview MC Hammer did was questions about Vanilla Ice. He was, at first, loving it. "Yeah, he's on tour with me." All the shows were packed, sold out everywhere.
He had the No. 1 record when I started on tour with him, and my record bumped his off. My merch was outselling his. I guess he got upset about it. And when he was signing merch, he got to a point where he goes, "I'm not signing any more Vanilla Ice merch."
So he took my sound.
I'm, like, "Man, I just played a show -- why was the volume so low? And why were all the lights off?" I walk out to the soundboard and I go, "Bro, what is all this tape?" You know what a fader is, where it goes from zero when you turn the volume up, and it says "master volume"? He had tape on the thing, and it said, "Ice level."
"MC Hammer came out here and told me I can't raise your volume level any more than this. I'll lose my job." I went to Hammer himself. And they wouldn't let me talk to him. "He's busy, man. He ain't have time for you, Ice."
Next day I come to my show, in a full sold-out stadium, and my dressing room is the bathroom. You have enough to fit two football teams in this entire arena, and you put me in the bathroom! My record is No. 1 on Billboard, and I'm in a bathroom?
He was mad at me for knocking his song off No. 1 and just being Vanilla Ice, I guess.
TEASER: Gucci Mane's Favorite Mixtape
HED: Gucci Mane's Make-or-Break Mixtape Moment
'06 Gucci, "Chicken Talk," I feel like that defined me. The determination in that tape, for it to even come to life, it's serious. It brings back memories every time I listen to it. I just know the person that I was then was bound to blow up. I felt like, "This is my only shot."
If that tape didn't get attention, if people didn't think that tape was dope, I probably would've just said, "[Expletive] music, I'm going to be in the streets."
Not the '06 "Hard to Kill" album that they put out with all those classics on it. The label didn't advance me no money, we had no relationship and it went sour from that point. But I spent my own money on this tape and put it out myself. I went back to my high school days.
People always have issues with their label and it [expletive] their career. I was like, "I'm not going to let that happen. I'm finna make this 'Chicken Talk."' I had just got out of jail, and I was definitely in the hood -- one foot in, one foot out.
But I didn't want to incarcerate myself, so I was trying to talk in code: "I'm like a rooster in a cartoon, I say I need a brick or two/half an onion worth of extra, ask me who I gave it to/raw basin' Willy, let him vacuum up the Bentley Coupe." All that was so real, I was just trying not to get indicted and go to jail for it. It was urgent, and there's a cleverness, too.
I ain't trying to be funny, but DJ Burn One was nothing to "Chicken Talk." I don't have anything against Burn One, but the only thing I cared about was, "I know my songs are good, don't talk over it." All that New York talking, I'm not really into that. And he didn't talk over it. That's really it. Just let the songs play.
But you're going to press 'em up and help me get 'em out? Cool, let's do it. I don't want these songs to just live on Zay's hard drive. Zaytoven would give me studio time and make his house available to me without charging me. That's my guy.
But the D.J.s, I don't know them. I can't tell you, really to this day, a lot about them, and they don't know much about me. But I did know the value of having someone spread my name out there. That was a cheap way. And I survived.
TEASER: Q-Tip on Slick Rick
HED: Slick Rick's Grown-Man Vulnerability
Q-Tip: I loved Slick Rick for the subject matter. The way he chose to tell a story, his humor. It was just very beyond his years. It made me want to step my game up, but also it made me feel like I could fit in, because my voice back then was even weirder than it is now. Not that Slick Rick's voice was weird -- it was atypical.
On "The Moment I Feared," this is what he said:
Well I'm sitting on my lunch break grinning my teeth
It's the last day of the week, boy, what a relief
My muscles kinda ache, they felt rigid and stiff
So I looked around and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be, I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55, almost time for the bell
Put the breath mints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
It's just so not teenager [expletive].
The salvo of that verse is they're going to a club -- "Boogie Down was performing, hey, they ain't no joke/And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was looking all down my throat/Was it my big chains with the big plates on them?/Then they rolled on me and told me to run 'em."
So in all that you get a blue-collar, everyday man. You get going out to the club. You get extravagance with the jewelry. You get violence. But the key thing is the whole song is about how he was in a vulnerable moment. And with the vulnerability, which he was so brilliant at, he was also self-effacing, right beside his brilliance and his ego.
Everybody at that time was, you know, basically superheroes. Dudes was, "Notorious, I'll crush you like a jelly bean," or they were taking "Seven M.C.s, put 'em in a line." Or, you know, even if we're uplifting, it's "Bass, how low can you go?" It was this very stern machismo or this idea of what manhood is, which was great, it's nothing to pooh-pooh at.
But on the other side of that, you had somebody who embodied those things, but still had the maturity and the honesty within the music to display that vulnerability.
TEASER: 50 Cent on Baby Oil
HED: Why 50 Cent Got All Oiled Up
When there's no plan B, you looking at everything and saying, "I gotta figure out what's gonna work or what's not gonna work." There's points where you're laughing at a guy and then you look and it's not funny no more. Like Juvenile. We would laugh at him on "400 Degreez." He was standing in front of the yellow Corvette and he had like a little bit too much baby oil on. He was shiny. We're laughing like, this [expletive] is country. And when them numbers came back, listen, I said, "Get me some baby oil!"
TEASER: Earl Sweatshirt on Hip-Hop Timing
HED: An Earl Sweatshirt Music Lesson
What's happened is people's relationship to the beat has changed. Kids now dance faster than the beat because kids have been learning how to dance on their front cameras. And so with their movements, they meet the beat at where it's gonna be. They don't let the beat direct the thing, you feel me?
The generation before, especially coming out of the '90s, all that is behind the beat. Everything is coming off the back of the beat. Like how Kurupt is rapping on "Cali Iz Active" -- he's finishing the word after the snare comes. Kids now, it's the polar opposite. You're racing, you feel me? 'Cause you want to finish what you're saying before the beat, so you can, like, dab. You create the space on the beat to hit your quan. Any place where there's a disconnect between old and young people is right there.
TEASER: Cardi B on Shmoney
HED: The Perks of Fame, According to Cardi B
I went from $ 20,000 a show and then after "Bodak Yellow," I went to 100. And then like two, three months later I went to 200, 300, 400, 500. Then in 2018, I was getting booked for like $ 700,000, $ 800,000. And then I went to millions. I haven't put out an album in five years and the numbers just keep going up.
When I bought my mom a house, that meant a lot to me. When I bought my house with my husband, that meant a lot to me. When I bought another house ... damn, I bought a lot of houses.
But it also do be the little things, right? I just bought this playground set for my kids and it's huge. It looks insane. And I spent in the 20 thousands for it. Of course it's not my biggest purchase ever, but this is what I work hard for, for my kids. Overly spending on your kids doesn't mean that you're a great parent, but it makes you feel good. It makes you feel like that you're living your childhood dream.
But it's everything -- the people that you meet, the access that you have. It's from the biggest things to the smallest things, you know what I'm saying? Like being able to go to Carbone whenever you want. Being able to skip lines everywhere is the greatest thing.
TEASER: 'Banned in the U.S.A.'
HED: 2 Live Crew's First Amendment Fights
Uncle Luke: It was actually three trials. We got no support at all from the industry. The parody trial, I was there to defend free speech. I was there to defend the Constitution in a hip-hop form, knowing that it was only a case because it was versus a hip-hop artist and company. My crazy ass was like, I'm gonna take the fight on. And then the obscenity case, when they deemed the record obscene, I think they realized, you can't shut this down, so let's drain him by tying him up in court. I eventually got it overturned in a court of appeals.
I could have left that on the books and been like, OK, that's precedent. But I was looking at it from the standpoint of I'm fighting for hip-hop. Because if I let this be the standard and it's on the books as case law, then they can use that against any other artist that say what they want to say on a record.
I always said these people that are not supporting me are idiots. The industry, they had a whole thing going on against me. People in the industry would go on television shows and be like, no, that's not hip-hop. We not supporting that. That's trash music. So they were saying the same things that all these other people were saying in court. They denounced it. It wasn't no cavalry coming.
There was a moment when I thought the Grammys was gonna be like, thank you. The industry was kinda getting behind me a little, more so the white industry, not necessarily the Black part of it.
So the guy gets up there and says, at this moment, we have a person that's fighting this fight for free speech, and nobody should censor our music. And I want to just honor this person because they're putting up the fight for all of us in the industry. And then the guy said, "Madonna." I've not been to the Grammys ever since.
When I did "Banned in the U.S.A.," MTV got behind it. I did "Banned in the U.S.A." at the MTV Awards in 1990. I felt appreciation, you know, being backstage with the other artists and they embracing you. One of the first people to ever come up to me and say "Thank you, I believe in what you're doing" -- outside of Bruce Springsteen, just talking to him over the phone saying that we want to do the song -- was Sinead O'Connor. We just sat there and talked the whole night until it was time for me to go on. To see that people are hearing you and supporting you, even though you might not hear them, it was big. And then we got onstage and did the song, it was such an emotional moment. Flavor Flav came to the stage and gave me a big hug, and all the other rappers came to the stage, and that was the moment of "We with you, we're feeling what you feeling."
TEASER: LL Cool J Meets Paul Simon
HED: LL Cool J Brings Paul Simon to His Basement
Paul Simon came to my basement in 1987, and we went and visited a high school. He's from Queens, too. I'm not saying Paul Simon was like some hip-hop dude that was out there promoting it, but he definitely was open-minded and willing to embrace it.
I'm gonna be honest with you, I didn't even know who Paul Simon was, bro. He came to my house, we did some interview, and we're gonna visit the high school. I love this guy now, he's amazing. But then, I didn't know. This is literally how I announced him. I was like, "Yo, I don't know if you know him or not y'all, but this is my man, Paul Simon." The high school went crazy. I was standing there like, oh [expletive]! I ain't know who he was! Like, what's going on?
They told me he was important. I respected him. And I went and listened to his music. Matter of fact, my mother had some of his music in the house, "Bridge Over Troubled Water" with Simon & Garfunkel. But I was listening to hip-hop, I was in a totally different world. The furthest I was going that way would be the O'Jays and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, but I never got to those albums. But he was a very cool dude, And I respect the fact that at that time he was a superstar, and he came to my house. Not to my block -- my house. In my basement.

For Workers in Some Fields, A.I.'s Threat Is Already Here: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To many people, chatbots and other technology feel like a ticking time bomb, sure to explode their work. But to some, the threat is already here.
"This A.I. stuff is getting really crazy."
The voices of Charlamagne tha God, host of the nationally syndicated radio show "The Breakfast Club," and his guests Mandii B and WeezyWTF filled Ylonda Sherrod's car as she sped down Interstate 10 in Mississippi during her daily commute. Her favorite radio show was discussing artificial intelligence, specifically an A.I.-generated sample of Biggie.
"Sonically, it sounds cool," Charlamagne tha God said. "But it lacks soul."
WeezyWTF replied: "I've had people ask me like, 'Oh, would you replace people that work for you with A.I.?' I'm like, 'No, dude."'
Ms. Sherrod nodded along emphatically, as she drove past low-slung brick homes and strip malls dotted with Waffle Houses. She arrived at the AT&T call center where she works, feeling unsettled. She played the radio exchange about A.I. for a colleague.
"Yeah, that's crazy," Ms. Sherrod's friend replied. "What do you think about us?"
Like so many millions of American workers, across so many thousands of workplaces, the roughly 230 customer service representatives at AT&T's call center in Ocean Springs, Miss., watched artificial intelligence arrive over the past year both rapidly and assuredly, like a new manager settling in and kicking up its feet.
Suddenly, the customer service workers weren't taking their own notes during calls with customers. Instead, an A.I. tool generated a transcript, which their managers could later consult. A.I. technology was providing suggestions of what to tell customers. Customers were also spending time on phone lines with automated systems, which solved simple questions and passed on the complicated ones to human representatives.
Ms. Sherrod, 38, who exudes quiet confidence at 5-foot-11, regarded the new technology with a combination of irritation and fear. "I always had a question in the back of my mind," she said. "Am I training my replacement?"
Ms. Sherrod, a vice president of the call center's local union chapter, part of the Communications Workers of America, started asking AT&T managers questions. "If we don't talk about this, it could jeopardize my family," she said. "Will I be jobless?"
In recent months, the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT has made its way into courtrooms, classrooms, hospitals and everywhere in between. With it has come speculation about A.I.'s impact on jobs. To many people, A.I. feels like a ticking time bomb, sure to explode their work. But to some, like Ms. Sherrod, the threat of A.I. isn't abstract. They can already feel its effects.
When automation swallows up jobs, it often comes for customer service roles first, which make up about three million jobs in America. Automation tends to overtake tasks that repeat themselves; customer service, already a major site for outsourcing of jobs abroad, can be a prime candidate.
A majority of U.S. call center workers surveyed this year reported that their employers were automating some of their work, according to a 2,000-person survey from researchers at Cornell. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they felt it was somewhat or very likely that increased use of bots would lead to layoffs within the next two years.
Technology executives point out that fears of automation are centuries old -- stretching back to the Luddites, who smashed and burned textile machines -- but have historically been undercut by a reality in which automation creates more jobs than it eliminates.
But that job creation happens gradually. The new jobs that technology creates, like engineering roles, often demand complex skills. That can create a gap for workers like Ms. Sherrod, who found what seemed like a golden ticket at AT&T: a job that pays $ 21.87 an hour and up to $ 3,000 in commissions a month, she said, and provides health care and five weeks of vacation -- all without the requirement of a college degree. (Less than 5 percent of AT&T's roles require a college education.)
Customer service, to Ms. Sherrod, meant that someone like her -- a young Black woman raised by her grandmother in small-town Mississippi -- could make "a really good living."
"We're breaking generational curses," Ms. Sherrod said. "That's for sure."
In Ms. Sherrod's childhood home, a one-story, brick A-frame in Pascagoula, money was tight. Her mother died when she was 5. Her grandmother, who took her in, didn't work, but Ms. Sherrod remembers getting food stamps to take to the corner bakery whenever the family could spare them. Ms. Sherrod cries recalling how Christmas used to be. The family had a plastic tree and tried to make it festive with ornaments, but there was typically no money for presents.
To students at Pascagoula High School, she recalled, job opportunities seemed limited. Many went to Ingalls Shipbuilding, a shipyard where work meant blistering days under the Mississippi sun. Others went to the local Chevron refinery.
"It felt like I was going to always have to do hard labor in order to make a living," Ms. Sherrod said. "It seemed like my lifestyle would never be something with ease, something I enjoyed."
When Ms. Sherrod was 16, she worked at KFC, making $ 6.50 an hour. After graduating from high school, and dropping out of community college, she moved to Biloxi, Miss., to work as a maid at IP Casino, a 32-story hotel, where her sister still works.
Within months of working at the casino, Ms. Sherrod felt the toll of the job on her body. Her knees ached, and her back thrummed with pain. She had to clean at least 16 rooms a day, fishing hair out of bathroom drains and rolling up dirty sheets.
When a friend told her about the jobs at AT&T, the opportunity seemed, to Ms. Sherrod, impossibly good. The call center was air-conditioned. She could sit all day and rest her knees. She took the call center's application test twice, and on her second time she got an offer, in 2006, starting out making $ 9.41 an hour, up from around $ 7.75 at the casino.
"That $ 9 meant so much to me," she recalled.
So did AT&T, a place where she kept growing more comfortable: "Out of 17 years, my check hasn't ever been wrong," she said. "AT&T, by far, is the best job in the area."
'Your Biggest Nightmare'
This spring, lawmakers in Washington hauled forward the makers of A.I. tools to begin discussing the risks posed by the products they've unleashed.
"Let me ask you what your biggest nightmare is," Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked OpenAI's chief executive, Sam Altman, after sharing that his own greatest fear was job loss.
"There will be an impact on jobs," said Mr. Altman, whose company developed ChatGPT.
That reality has already become clear. The British telecommunications company BT Group announced in May that it would cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030 as it increasingly relied on A.I. The chief executive of IBM said A.I. would affect certain clerical jobs in the company, eliminating the need for up to 30 percent of some roles, while creating new ones.
AT&T has begun integrating A.I. into many parts of its customer service work, including routing customers to agents, offering suggestions for technical solutions during customer calls and producing transcripts.
The company said all of these uses were intended to create a better experience for customers and workers. "We're really trying to focus on using A.I. to augment and assist our employees," said Nicole Rafferty, who leads AT&T's customer care operation and works with staff members nationwide.
"We're always going to need in-person engagement to solve those complex customer situations," Ms. Rafferty added. "That's why we're so focused on building A.I. that supports our employees."
Economists studying A.I. have argued that it most likely won't prompt sudden widespread layoffs. Instead, it could gradually eliminate the need for humans to do certain tasks -- and make the remaining work more challenging.
"The tasks left to call center workers are the most complex ones, and customers are frustrated," said Virginia Doellgast, a professor at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell.
Ms. Sherrod has always enjoyed getting to know her customers. She said she took about 20 calls a day, from 9:30 to 6:30. While she's resolving technical issues, she listens to why people are calling in, and she hears from customers who just bought new homes, were married or lost family members.
"It's sort of like you're a therapist," she said. "They tell you their life stories."
She is already finding her job growing more challenging with A.I. The automated technology has a hard time understanding Ms. Sherrod's drawl, she said, so the transcripts from her calls are full of mistakes. Once the technology is no longer in a pilot phase, she won't be able to make corrections. (AT&T said it was refining the A.I. products it used to prevent these kinds of errors.)
It seems likely, to Ms. Sherrod, that at some point as the work gets more efficient, the company won't need quite as many humans answering calls in its centers.
Ms. Sherrod wonders, too: Doesn't the company trust her? For two consecutive years, she won AT&T's Summit Award, placing her in the top 3 percent of the company's customer service representatives nationally. Her name was projected on the call center's wall.
"They gave everyone a little gift bag with a trophy," Ms. Sherrod recalled. "That meant a lot to me."
'Look at My Life'
As companies like AT&T embrace A.I., experts are floating proposals meant to protect workers. There's the possibility of training programs helping people make the transition to new jobs, or a displacement tax levied on employers when a worker's job is automated but the person is not retrained.
Labor unions are wading into these battles. In Hollywood, the unions representing actors and television writers have fought to limit the use of A.I. in script writing and production.
Just 6 percent of the country's private-sector workers are represented by unions. Ms. Sherrod is one, and she has begun fighting her company for more information about its A.I. plans, sitting in her union hall nine miles from the call center, where she works under a Norman Rockwell painting of a wireline technician.
For years, Ms. Sherrod's demands on behalf of the union have been rote. As a steward, she typically asked the company to reduce penalties for colleagues who got in trouble.
But for the first time, this summer, she feels that she is taking up an issue that will affect workers beyond AT&T. She recently asked her union to establish a task force focused on A.I.
In late May, Ms. Sherrod was invited by the Communications Workers of America to travel to Washington, where she and dozens of other workers met with the White House's Office of Public Engagement to share their experience with A.I.
A warehouse worker described being monitored with A.I. that tracked how speedily he moved packages, creating pressure for him to skip breaks. A delivery driver said automated surveillance technologies were being used to monitor workers and look for potential disciplinary actions, even though their records weren't reliable. Ms. Sherrod described how the A.I. in her call center created inaccurate summaries of her work.
Her son, Malik, was astonished to hear that his mother was headed to the White House. "When my dad told me about it, at first I said, 'You're lying,"' he said with a laugh.
Ms. Sherrod sometimes feels that her life presents an argument for a type of job that one day might no longer exist.
With her pay and commissions, she has been able to buy a home. She lives on a sunny street full of families, some of whom work in fields like nursing and accounting. She is down the road from a softball field and playground. On the weekends, her neighbors gather for cookouts. The adults eat snowballs, while the children play basketball and set up splash pads.
Ms. Sherrod takes pride in buying Malik anything he asks for. She wants to give him the childhood she never had.
"Call center work -- it's life-changing," she said. "Look at my life. Will all that be taken away from me?"

Denny Crum, 86, Coach Who Built Louisville Into a Basketball Powerhouse: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He led the Cardinals to two national championships in the 1980s and amassed 675 victories over a career that led to his induction into two halls of fame.
Denny Crum, who won two N.C.A.A. men's basketball championships and built the University of Louisville into one of the dominant programs of the 1980s during a long Hall of Fame coaching career, died on Tuesday at his home in Louisville, Ky. He was 86.
The university announced his death after being informed by his wife, Susan. No cause was given. Crum had a mild stroke in August 2017 while fishing in Alaska and another two years two ago.
Nicknamed Cool Hand Luke because of his unflinching sideline demeanor, Crum retired in March 2001 after 30 seasons at Louisville with a record of 675-295 and championships in 1980 and 1986.
A former assistant under the renowned U.C.L.A. coach John Wooden, Crum often wore a red blazer and waved a rolled-up stat sheet like a bandleader's baton as he directed Louisville to 23 N.C.A.A. tournaments and six Final Fours. He was voted college coach of the year three times.
He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., in May 1994, with Wooden, his college coach at U.C.L.A. and longtime mentor, at his side. Crum finished with 11 more wins than Wooden had amassed at U.C.L.A. and was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, in Kansas City, Mo., in 2006.
Denzel Edwin Crum was born on March 2, 1937, in San Fernando, Calif. He played guard for two seasons at Pierce Junior College in Los Angeles before transferring to U.C.L.A. in 1956.
The Bruins went 38-14 in Crum's two seasons as a player. He briefly served as a graduate assistant to Wooden before coaching Pierce in the mid-1960s.
Wooden hired Crum as his assistant and chief recruiter in 1968, when the Bruins were in the midst of their dynastic run to 10 N.C.A.A. championships. Crum is credited with luring the future Hall of Famer Bill Walton to U.C.L.A., and the Bruins went 86-4 and won three N.C.A.A. titles during Crum's three seasons there.
He succeeded John Dromo as Louisville's coach in April 1971.
Until then, Louisville had enjoyed little postseason success, reaching only the 1956 N.I.T. championship and the 1959 N.C.A.A. Final Four. The Cardinals lost Crum's first game, 70-69, to Florida but then reeled off 15 consecutive victories.
"Denny was so good that I knew I wasn't going to keep him very long," Wooden once told The Courier Journal of Louisville. "I was pleased when he got the job at Louisville. I had always hoped when I retired that he'd be the one to succeed me, but he left and proved to be just what I thought he was."
Crum's Cardinals won the Missouri Valley Conference -- the first of his 15 regular-season league titles -- and then reached the Final Four, where they met Wooden's Bruins. At the time, Crum was the third coach to lead his team to the Final Four in his first season. But the Bruins won, 96-77, on their way to a sixth straight championship.
The schools met again in the semifinals three seasons later with a similar result: U.C.L.A. won, 75-74, in overtime. By then Crum had employed much of Wooden's fundamentally focused style, but with pressure defense and a fast-breaking flair. Instead of an offense built around a dominant center, Crum used athletic guards and forwards who could finish plays with the high-flying dunks Wooden eschewed.
Crum's philosophy helped make the Cardinals perennial N.C.A.A. tournament participants, with 20 or more wins each season from 1975 through 1979. Louisville's breakthrough came in the 1979-80 season, when the homegrown star guard Darrell Griffith and the so-called Doctors of Dunk marched through the regular season, 26-3, and won their second Metro Conference championship in three years.
Crum's second-seeded Cardinals reached their third Final Four in nine seasons, only to run up against U.C.L.A. again, this time coached by Larry Brown. Louisville finally prevailed, with a 59-54 championship-game win in Indianapolis led by the high-flying all-American Griffith.
Crum's second title followed in 1986, when Louisville beat Duke, 72-69.
The second half of his tenure was not nearly as successful as the first. Louisville endured two separate N.C.A.A. investigations and never again returned to the Final Four under his watch.
After his retirement, Crum was a co-host with Joe B. Hall, the longtime Kentucky men's basketball coach, of a sports radio program heard in Kentucky. Hall died last year at 93.
Crum remained a respected presence around Louisville. He frequently attended Cardinals games on the KFC Yum! Center home court bearing his name. He was present for the September 2022 dedication of Denny Crum Hall, a new campus dormitory for athletes and students. And he had a front-row seat in March 2022 for the introduction of one of his former players, Kenny Payne, as the Cardinals' coach.
Complete information on Crum's survivors was not immediately available.

They Met on Instagram and Took Off on TikTok: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nora Achmaoui and Khalid Alherani met on Instagram. One month later, they started a TikTok account that now has 1.3 million followers.
Nora Achmaoui made the first move on Khalid Alherani in September 2021 in typical Gen Z fashion: She liked two of his pictures on Instagram after finding his profile on her explore page.
Although they disagree on what exactly happened next -- she said he immediately liked her "whole feed," while he claimed that could not be possible because he was at the gym at the time -- they both agree that he liked several of her photos in response.
In Instagram culture, liking several photos in return is the indication that there is mutual interest. So, Mr. Alherani was under the impression that Ms. Achmaoui would make the next move. After waiting for a few minutes, he got impatient. He decided to send her a direct message: "Hi, how are you?"
From then on, they "literally spoke every second," Mr. Alherani said. "She was telling me about her whole day and each thing she's doing."
They instantly felt comfortable with each other. "She started sending me weird things, and I started sending her weird things," he said. As an example, he mentioned one instance when she sent him a photo of her nose.
"I was like, 'Why would you send me that?'," Mr. Alherani said. But he found it charming that she was comfortable being herself.
After talking for four days, they had their first date at Dubai Safari Park on Oct. 1.
Mr. Alherani, 25, and Ms. Achmaoui, 27, both live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He is Palestinian; she is Moroccan and from Süsterseel, Germany. She moved to Dubai in November 2020.
On their first date, Mr. Alherani recalled that Ms. Achmaoui wore light blue Nike Air Jordan 1s that were several sizes too large. "I could see her feet going in and out and in and out," he said. (In defense, she said she had been "dying to get them," but they were sold out in her size.)
Mr. Alherani was not the only one observing style choices that day, because while Ms. Achmaoui was wearing shoes that were too big, he was wearing clothes that were too small.
"He was wearing a shirt full of colors with neon shoes, and the shirt was maybe two sizes too small," she said. "I remember thinking that he's marriage material, but we definitely need to change the style, that's for sure," she said, playfully. (His response? "Whatever," with an eye roll.)
Mr. Alherani picked her up in his car for their first date, and they went to Ms. Achmaoui's favorite restaurant, Saddle Cafe, for breakfast at 4 p.m. because she forgot to eat that day. Although they had only known each other for four days, he already knew that she had a habit of accidentally skipping meals.
Afterward, at the safari, the two entertained each other with their "silly jokes." "I saw a giraffe, and I just made a stupid joke: 'Oh, she looks like you,"' Mr. Alherani said. "And we kept laughing for the whole day, I don't know why."
They stayed at the safari until it closed, and then had dinner at Bab Al Mansour, a Moroccan restaurant. Mr. Alherani had a family dinner afterward, but he didn't want the first date to end, so he ate dinner twice that night.
Ms. Achmaoui said that she called her mother after she got home that night. "I told her I think I found 'the one,"' she said. Mr. Alherani also called his best friend and told him about how easy their conversations felt on the first date.
"When I sat with her, I really opened up with her," said Mr. Alherani, who is usually a private person.
They have seen each other every single day since their first date, with the exception of one week in August 2022, when Ms. Achmaoui visited her family in Germany.
During their second date at Sunrise Beach, "they chose this life" of marriage, Mr. Alherani said. As they sat in his car by the ocean, drinking acai smoothies from Saddle Cafe, the same restaurant they stopped by on their first date, he confessed to her that he is not yet financially stable. He felt he should tell her from the get-go, as they were already dreaming of a future together.
"I didn't want to waste her time," he said.
"I think this moment was when I fell in love because of his honesty," she said. "I knew even if he's not stable, when we would take this path together, we would succeed."
Ms. Achmaoui's indifference toward Mr. Alherani's financial position motivated him to "push hard," he said. He had graduated earlier that year in March from Near East University, a college in Nicosia, Cyprus, with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. He was still figuring out his career and was working with his father for his interior design company, Atwaar Decoration Design, for the time being.
Ms. Achmaoui graduated from DHBW Mosbach, a college in Germany, in 2017 with a bachelor's degree in international business, innovation and techniques.
The next day, they visited Abu Dhabi, which is an hour drive away from Dubai. Although Mr. Alherani was born and raised in Dubai, he had never visited Abu Dhabi before, so Ms. Achmaoui served as his tour guide, showing him sites like the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, the Etihad Towers and the Emirates Palace.
A month after they met, in November 2021, they posted a TikTok video of themselves participating in a trend where they tried to trick each other into looking in a specific direction. At the time, Mr. Alherani "hated social media," he said. "I remember how much he was fighting me for posting it," Ms. Achmaoui added. But overnight, the video received 1.5 million views.

For Ms. Achmaoui, going viral after one post was a "sign" that they should seriously pursue TikTok as a source of income. They posted four TikToks every day on their couple account, and within the first week, they received 40,000 new followers.
"I promised him if he pushed with me for one year, we're going to have one million followers," she said. "And within one year we received 1.2 million followers."
Today, @noraandkhalid has 1.3 million followers on TikTok. There, they post couples content and skits about relationships. Both are currently full-time content creators.
"It really enabled us to get married so soon because otherwise we wouldn't be financially stable," she said. Ms. Achmaoui is also an entrepreneurial coach for Sheeo Consulting, a company she started in 2019 that helps women start their own businesses. Mr. Alherani is also a personal trainer in mixed martial arts.
On May 28, 2022, on her birthday, he proposed to her on a vacation in Petra, Jordan, though he could not utter any words when he pulled out the diamond ring. "He was just standing in front of me, kneeling with the ring, but not asking anything," Ms. Achmaoui said.
The proposal came as a surprise to Ms. Achmaoui because their original plan had been that she would be the one to propose. "I thought he deserved to be asked and to feel as special as he makes me feel every day," she said. Still, her plan was on.
On Eid al-Adha, July 8, 2022, she proposed to Mr. Alherani in front of his parents and six siblings in his living room, with a white gold and black ceramic ring she purchased for him from Cartier.
"He was so shocked and nervous, and a bit shy, because as Arabs, you usually don't show those emotions in front of your family," Ms. Achmaoui said. "He cried, I cried."
Mr. Alherani was still living with his family in Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai, at this time, and he moved into Ms. Achmaoui's apartment in the nearby Barsha Heights on the day after their wedding.
On Feb. 22, 2023, the couple were married by Imam Ahmed Maher of Abdullah Mohammad Al Shirawi Mosque at Bab Al Shams Desert Resort, which provided the event space.
The couple received sponsorships from Omer Rasool Events, the planner, and Anastasia Panjinskaya, the videographer and photographer. Their wedding outfits were also gifted: Ms. Achmaoui wore dresses made by Amira Lebsatte, Ezra Couture and Alaa Duba. Mr. Alherani wore outfits by Zaid Farouki and Emad Tariq Hussein.
Their wedding was steeped in Moroccan and Palestinian culture. Inez Atili, a Moroccan singer, performed.
Ms. Achmaoui also sang an original song that she wrote, called "Candle lights and KFC." (KFC is his favorite restaurant.) Although she never sang in front of an audience before, she wanted to surprise him on their wedding day in front of their 120 guests. The song shared personal anecdotes from their love story, including overcoming familial and cultural differences as a Palestinian and Moroccan couple and about the "light feeling" she experiences with him.
"One thing that people always used to tell me is that love is easy, but in my past, love felt like a lot of drama and a lot of heartbreak," Ms. Achmaoui said. "For the first time, with him, love felt easy."
On This Day
When Feb. 22, 2023
Where Bab Al Shams Desert Resort, Dubai, United Arab Emirates
Equestrian Entrances Ms. Achmaoui made her bridal entrance on a white horse accompanied with Moroccan folk music by Dakka Marrakchia, and Mr. Alherani entered on a brown horse with Palestinian dabke music. A dance battle ensued, but the couple disagreed on which side outdanced the other. Ms. Achmaoui's family, in the background during a video interview, shouted that the Moroccans won. "No, no, no! Her community is the Moroccans. If I'm going to ask my community, they're going to say the Palestinians," Mr. Alherani said in response.
Food on Wheels Rather than plated or buffet meals, the couple brought in food trucks that served Palestinian food like ouzi (a rice dish) and warak enab (grape leaves) and Moroccan food like couscous and pastilla (chicken pie). For a "modern twist," they had a frozen yogurt truck and a fruit bar, Ms. Achmaoui said.
All White in the Desert: Ms. Achmaoui wore a takshita, a traditional Moroccan two piece dress, and Mr. Alherani wore a qumbaz, a Palestinian garment. Although it was a challenge to get their guests to abide by the all-white theme, it was worth it for the couple. "Everyone looked like angels in the desert," Ms. Achmaoui said.

Full text: Have you experienced the magic of McDonald's Sprite? With its electric spice, its zhush, its je ne sais quoi, it is, of course, supreme among all sugary drinks, a star in the great firmament of processed foods.
I grew up loving processed foods: There's the kind in a can (SpaghettiOs, Chef Boyardee, Vienna Sausage) and the kind in a cardboard box or plastic container (the many varieties of Hamburger Helper or instant ramen). There's the fresh kind (McDonald's and KFC, Popeyes and Burger King, Domino's, Pizza Hut and Little Caesars) and there's the frozen kind (Tyson and Totino's, Gorton's, Swanson and Ore-Ida, frozen finger foods and full-on meals). And there's fancy-ish processed food of the Red Lobster or Olive Garden or LongHorn Steakhouse variety, and there's less fancy processed food, like chicken wings from 7-Eleven or hot dogs or burritos or insert-your-regional-specialty-here from the convenience store down the street.
For much of my 24 years, I was a processed-food connoisseur. The Tex-Mex dishes characteristic of the Rio Grande Valley, where I grew up, and these processed foods, distinctly American, constituted my diet through the end of high school. About half of the Rio Grande Valley is a food desert, a phrase that describes a place where it's hard to obtain healthy, nutritious foods because of factors like cost, distance and time. But even those who can get something other than processed and fast food often still eat it. Almost all the people I knew ate this way, didn't mind eating this way, enjoyed eating this way, even though they knew it was unhealthy.
Today, I'm embarrassed to admit that I loved these foods, that I ate them without much of a second thought for most of my life. I'm embarrassed because I "know better" now.
I use that phrase only because I have received a social education that has taught me that some foods are "good" and others are "bad," that what I eat says something meaningful about who I am.
This social education began when I went to Yale, where, as The Times has reported, at one point "more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent." Many people I met there couldn't distinguish among chicken nuggets from McDonald's, Burger King and Chick-fil-A.
My freshman year, I found myself listening to some classmates chatting about ice cream, homemade with fresh strawberries. They went on about how singular and spectacular it was, about how much they loved it. I'd never eaten ice cream made with fresh strawberries, had never eaten homemade ice cream. My naïveté led me to believe that this shouldn't stop me from participating in the conversation, so I said that I liked the flavor of artificial strawberry ice cream. There's just something about that fake flavor, I said, something special about strawberry syrup.
The people around me looked at me as if I were an alien. I understood then that I was an alien, that processed food was the food of the Other America -- or what most Americans just call America. I already knew that I wasn't part of the 1 percent, but this moment underscored that where I came from and what I liked were more foreign than I could have imagined.
For a while, I continued to defend this way of eating to other people and to myself. Whereas critics and skeptics balked at the ease with which processed food could be acquired and produced, I lauded the efficiency of the industrialized food system. Whereas the foodies squinted at the amalgamating of animal products and preservatives into something palatable, I sang the praises of foods that were, in their mediocrity, paradoxically pretty good. Whereas the closet processed-food enjoyers (I know you're out there!) fretted about processed food being unnatural, I wondered who needed nature anyway, that source of decay and death.
I was embarrassed to find an ally in Donald Trump. His love of Big Macs, Filet-O-Fishes and Diet Coke made people's heads explode. When he served a feast of fast food at the White House? The scandal!
Still, for me, McDonald's in the White House sounded like a dream. It was easy to laugh at the contradictions between Mr. Trump's cultural tastes and his class status, but I understood that those very contradictions are what made him a democrat with a lowercase d, just another American who ate processed food, what he calls "Great American food."
But the more time I spent in this world of homemade ice cream and duck and kale, the more familiar it became to me. Further moments of alienation helped accelerate my assimilation: "Oh, you're from the Rio Grande Valley?" a professor with limited experience of the area once asked me. "That's where they think Olive Garden is a fancy restaurant, right?" My new peers might have been ignorant of the foods that raised me, but I wasn't going to return the favor.
I have expanded my culinary horizons. When I moved to New York in 2021, I decided to stock my kitchen with many of the pots, pans and gadgets recommended by the website Serious Eats. I bought and skimmed the cookbook "Salt Fat Acid Heat." I learned how to brine and roast a chicken. I started buying salads from Trader Joe's.
I didn't stop eating processed foods. In fact, I probably ate more of them. In the maelstrom of the past three years, a time filled with loss, uncertainty and change, in which I graduated from college during a pandemic and moved to New York to start a job that was supposed to last only a year, I sought an anchor in the foods of my youth. I wanted to recapture that magic, the excitement at the prospect of satisfaction and pleasure. So I ate McDonald's and Little Caesars and Hamburger Helper, trying to achieve what the food writer M.F.K. Fisher describes as that "warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied."
The old comfort, however, was nowhere to be found. It felt as if I were sitting at a slot machine, pulling the lever over and over, waiting for this order, this pizza, this French fry to make me feel I'd hit the jackpot. But the food just made me feel sick. My skin would itch, my stomach would turn. I'd get a headache.
By the latter half of 2022, I'd turned my temporary job into a permanent one, renewed my lease and had begun to ease further into the life of a member of the professional-managerial class. The maelstrom, if not completely calmed, was abating. Around that time, I began to experience odd cravings. One evening, I wanted lettuce. With apples and walnuts. And chicken -- cold. I had to Google it to be sure, but I realized I wanted a Waldorf salad.
My culinary tastes have changed along with my socioeconomic position. I have come to accept that the kinds of food we eat and appreciate signal to the world and to ourselves something about who we are, about who we were, about who we have become. I'm fundamentally happy to now live a life where I not only understand references to the madeleine in Proust but have actually eaten one (and at a writing class in the South of France, no less).
But I am mourning the loss of something I loved -- I wish eating a McNugget could still transport me to a time of warmth and love and safety, a time when I didn't know what a madeleine was, when I didn't know any better.

Full text: Ajay Banga will begin a monthlong "global listening tour" to drum up support for his nomination to be the bank's next president.
The Biden administration's nominee to be the next president of the World Bank, the international development and climate institution, is embarking on a monthlong sprint around the globe to solidify support for his candidacy.
It will be the first opportunity for the nominee, Ajay Banga, to share his vision for the bank, which has been aiming to take on a more ambitious role in combating climate change while maintaining its core commitment to alleviating poverty.
Mr. Banga, who has had a long career in finance, faces the challenge of convincing nations that his decades of private-sector experience will help him transform the World Bank.
He will begin his "global listening tour" on Monday with stops in Ivory Coast and Kenya, the Treasury Department said on Friday. In Ivory Coast, he will meet with senior government officials, leaders of the African Development Bank and civil society organizations. In Kenya, he will visit the Kenya Climate Innovation Center and a World Bank-backed project that helps local entrepreneurs find ways to address climate change.
Mr. Banga will focus on how finding development solutions can be intertwined with climate goals and emphasize his experience working on financial inclusion in Africa, where he helped expand access to electronic payments systems while chief executive of Mastercard, a Treasury official said.
The whirlwind campaign will also take Mr. Banga to Asia, Latin America and Europe.
The White House nominated him last week after the unexpected announcement last month that David Malpass will step down as World Bank president by the end of June, nearly a year before the end of his five-year term. Mr. Malpass, who was nominated by President Donald J. Trump, ignited a controversy last year when he appeared to express skepticism about whether fossil fuels contribute to global warming.
During a briefing at the Treasury Department this week, Mr. Banga made clear that he had no doubts about the causes of climate change. "Yes, there is scientific evidence, and it matters," he said.
Careful to strike a balance between the bank's growing climate ambitions and its poverty-reduction goals, Mr. Banga emphasized that both issues were interconnected and equally important.
"My belief is that poverty alleviation, or shared prosperity, or all those words that essentially imply the idea of tackling inequality, cannot be divorced from the challenges of managing nature in a constructive way," Mr. Banga added.
The World Bank's nomination process runs through March 29, and other countries may offer candidates. But by tradition, the United States, the bank's largest shareholder, selects an American to be its president. The executive board hopes to choose a new president by early May.
If approved by the board, Mr. Banga will face an array of challenges. The world economy is slowly emerging from three years of pandemic and war that have slowed global growth and worsened poverty. Emerging economies face the prospect of a cascade of defaults in the coming years, and the World Bank has been vocal in calling for debt reduction.
The Biden administration has pointed to China, one of the world's largest creditors, as a primary obstacle in debt-restructuring efforts. Mr. Banga was careful not to be critical of China and said he expected to travel there in the coming weeks.
"Today I'm the nominee of the United States, but if I'm lucky enough to be elected, then I represent all the countries who are part of the bank," Mr. Banga said on Thursday. "Having their points of view known, understood and openly discussed -- maybe not agreed to, but openly discussed -- is an important part of leading a multilateral institution."
His nomination has won both praise and skepticism from climate activists and development experts.
Some climate groups have lamented Mr. Banga's lack of direct public-sector experience and expressed concern about his affiliation with companies that invest in the oil and gas industries.
"Many question whether his history at global multinationals such as Citibank, Nestlé, KFC and Mastercard will prepare him for the huge challenges of poverty and inequality," Recourse, a nonprofit environmental organization, said in a statement this week. Recourse has been critical of the World Bank's policies on gas transition, its exposure to coal and its pace of action on climate change.
Other prominent activists have praised Mr. Banga, including Vice President Al Gore, who predicted that he would bring "renewed leadership on the climate crisis to the World Bank."
And others viewed Mr. Banga as a natural choice to bridge the gap between the bank's broad mandates.
"Throughout discussions of the World Bank's evolution, borrowing countries have consistently communicated that financing for climate should not come at the expense of other development priorities," Stephanie Segal, a senior fellow with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in an essay this week. "In nominating Banga, whose candidacy does not lead with climate, the United States has signaled agreement that the bank's development mandate cannot be abandoned in favor of a 'climate only' agenda."
The Biden administration has also faced questions about why it did not choose a woman to lead the bank, which has had only men serve as its full-time president.
Mr. Banga asserted that as someone who was born and educated in India, he would bring diversity and a unique perspective to the World Bank. He also emphasized that at Mastercard, he had demonstrated a commitment to empowering women and elevating them to senior roles.
"I think that you should credit the administration with taking a huge leap forward into finding somebody who wasn't born here, wasn't educated here," Mr. Banga said. "I believe that giving people a level playing field is our job."
He added: "And that means whether you're a woman, your color, your sexual orientation, growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, it doesn't matter."

U.S. Loans $ 2 Billion
To Support Battery Effort
The Energy Department on Thursday announced a $ 2 billion loan to help a Nevada company step up production of critical components of electric vehicle batteries.
The company, Redwood Materials, plans to use the loan to expand a manufacturing campus near Reno, Nev., where it makes some of the components from new and recycled sources. The company was founded by J.B. Straubel, a former top Tesla executive, and has partnerships with Panasonic, Ford Motor, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.
After construction is complete, Redwood aims to produce enough battery materials at the Nevada campus to support production of more than one million electric vehicles a year. The loan will help to create about 3,400 construction jobs, Redwood and the Energy Department said. The company said it expected about 1,600 full-time employees to work at the campus when it was finished.
The announcement was the latest loan from the department to support domestic battery manufacturing as the Biden administration seeks to bring more of the supply chain for electric vehicles to the United States and reduce reliance on China. Last month, the department said it would lend $ 700 million to support a mining project in Nevada. In December, the department announced a $ 2.5 billion loan for Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution. NIRAJ CHOKSHI
RIDE HAILING
Lyft Blames Bad Weather
For Bleak Revenue Forecast
Lyft on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, blaming extremely cold weather in some of its major markets and lower prices, especially during peak hours, sending its shares down 23 percent in extended trading.
The company's outlook was in contrast to that of its larger rival, Uber, whose strong presence globally is helping it ride a boom in demand for ride-hailing services from travelers and officegoers
Lyft's bigger presence on the West Coast, a region that analysts have said was trailing the rest of the United States in return to pre-Covid demand, could be hurting its recovery compared with Uber's.
Lyft forecast first-quarter revenue of about $ 975 million, which fell below analyst estimates of $ 1.09 billion, according to Refinitiv data. REUTERS
FAST FOOD
Chick-fil-A Will Test
Plant-Based Sandwich
Chick-fil-A said Thursday that it's testing its first plant-based entrée -- a breaded cauliflower sandwich -- at restaurants in Denver; Charleston, S.C.; and the Greensboro, N.C., area. The test begins Monday.
The Atlanta-based company said its culinary team spent four years developing the sandwich after guests told the chain they wanted to add more vegetables to their diets. Chick-fil-A tested mushrooms, chickpeas and chopped vegetables formed into patties but kept returning to cauliflower for its mild flavor.
Like Chick-fil-A's signature chicken sandwich, the cauliflower steak is marinated, breaded, pressure-cooked and then served on a bun with two pickle slices.
Chick-fil-A is a relative latecomer to the plant-based fast food scene. Burger King started selling its Impossible Whopper -- featuring a plant-based burger made by Impossible Foods -- in 2019. Starbucks launched an Impossible sausage sandwich in 2020. McDonald's debuted its McPlant burger -- developed with Beyond Meat -- in the United Kingdom in 2021. And KFC began selling Beyond Meat nuggets last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

South Africa's Power Crisis Declared a 'Disaster': [Foreign Desk]

Full text: President Cyril Ramaphosa, facing rising public wrath, on Thursday declared a "state of disaster" and pledged to end an energy crisis that threatens economic and political stability.
With South Africa enduring daily power outages of up to 10 hours, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a nationwide "state of disaster" on Thursday to address an electricity crisis so dire that day-old chicks are freezing to death, supermarket owners are rushing to sell meat before it spoils and many businesses have been forced to shut down.
The blackouts are caused by an aging fleet of coal-fired power stations that the dysfunctional state power company, Eskom, is struggling to keep online. Power cuts have been a part of life in South Africa for nearly 16 years, but the past several months have been the darkest yet.
From large industries to mom-and-pop stores, many businesses have closed or laid off workers in a country where one in three people is already jobless. With the outages driving up the cost of doing business, prices for everyday goods have shot up, as has the frustration of a populace losing faith in the government.
"We are therefore declaring a national state of disaster to respond to the electricity crisis and its effect," Mr. Ramaphosa announced in his state-of-the-nation speech. "The people of South Africa want action; they want solutions."
The blackouts have consumed the president and his party, the African National Congress, which had promised to reinvigorate South Africa's collapsing economy.
Political opponents and civic organizations have staged large street protests and dragged the government to court for failing to uphold its constitutional mandate as the outages have interrupted trade, education and health care.
Despite the dramatic "disaster" declaration, effective immediately, Mr. Ramaphosa did not offer any new plan to end the crisis. He said that he was appointing a minister of electricity, and that the declaration would allow the government to accelerate power projects and exempt food producers and other critical industries from power cuts.
For all the political bluster, the crisis plays out in life's most mundane rituals, in places like Meyerton, a town 34 miles southwest of Johannesburg surrounded by farms and factories.
At Foodzone, a corner supermarket just off the main road, when the clock struck noon on a recent day, the music stopped abruptly, the refrigerators stopped humming and the fluorescent lights went dark.
"Oh, see, there it goes," said Karina da Silva, the store's co-owner.
It was the second power outage of the day, and the refrigerators were as warm as a cupboard. Ms. da Silva and her husband, Eddie da Silva, rifled through packs of sausages, chicken and burger patties, checking their expiration dates. Mr. da Silva fired up a generator to keep the cash registers going, and the supermarket's cooks fried up the thawing meat on a gas burner to sell at a discount to customers whose stoves at home would be useless during the outage. The store has taken most of its egg dishes off the menu.
"You don't want a rotten egg in your store," said Mr. da Silva, tapping his nose.
Laying off their already lean staff of 14 would make running the store impossible, and the da Silvas are not sure how they will survive.
"I don't think things are going to change for us; it's not going to get better," Ms. da Silva said.
Since 2007, power outages have become so common that Eskom, the national electricity supplier, has devised a schedule to cut the power to different neighborhoods at different times. It calls these periods of national frustration "loadshedding."
Eskom's troubles are the result of a century of poor management, experts on energy and economics said in interviews. During apartheid, the utility, which mostly supplied the country's white minority, subsidized the cost of electricity for big industries like mining, meaning that many lucrative companies did not pay their fair share.
That legacy of low tariffs continues to hamper Eskom's ability to cover basic costs like maintenance, said Jesse Burton, a researcher in the Energy Systems Research Group at the University of Cape Town.
When the A.N.C. came to power in 1994, it failed to expand the utility at a time when the fleet began to buckle under growing demand and shrinking revenue. Corruption and incompetence in the construction of new power plants only made things worse. Mismanagement in successive presidential administrations hobbled Eskom until it collapsed.
"It's institutional failure at every level," said Ms. Burton. "They're in a debt spiral, and they're in a maintenance spiral."
Since taking office five years ago, Mr. Ramaphosa created a broad-reaching strategy to save Eskom. It included a plan to fix existing power stations, introduce renewable energy and allow private companies to produce power.
But the plan has produced few visible results. Those charged with solving the problem are bitterly divided. Gwede Mantashe, South Africa's energy minister and one of Mr. Ramaphosa's top lieutenants in the A.N.C., accused Andre de Ruyter, the chief executive of Eskom, in December of trying to undermine the A.N.C.-led government.
Mr. de Ruyter, tapped by Mr. Ramaphosa to save Eskom, quit a week later. He said in an interview with The Financial Times that someone had tried to assassinate him by lacing his coffee with cyanide. Eskom declined to comment on the allegation, and Mr. de Ruyter did not respond to a message seeking comment.
The fatal flaw in Mr. Ramaphosa's effort to rescue Eskom is that he has tried to do too many things at once, said Khaya Sithole, an economic analyst in Johannesburg. His plan, like those of previous administrations, failed to focus on the fundamental challenge: maintenance.
"Maintenance does not amount to a new project, so if it's not a new project, you're not going to have a P.R. exercise where you're cutting a ribbon," Mr. Sithole said.
Analysts say that solving the energy crisis would require bold measures, like going into debt or putting in place a tiered tariff system in which the poor are subsidized while big companies pay more.
"The people who will suffer most acutely from all of these problems are the poor and the marginalized, and that's where the seeds of a social revolution are going to be planted," said Mr. Sithole.
The power crisis has created some winners, though. During outages, copper thieves have ripped out wiring to sell, leaving neighborhoods without power for days. In Meyerton, a general supply store is trying to capitalize on the need for alternative energy sources by selling solar panels alongside dog food and laundry detergent.
Still, there is mostly suffering.
The prolonged power outages are threatening the food supply. The South African Poultry Association and other agricultural groups lobbied the government to exempt them from loadshedding, said Izaak Breitenbach, head of the association.
In December, KFC announced that it was temporarily closing some of its stores because of a chicken shortage. The price of chicken in stores has increased, along with eggs and other food. Public attention turned to farms when images of hundreds of dead birds began to circulate in the local news and on social media.
With heaters going out during power cuts, some chicks are freezing.
On a small farm outside Meyerton recently, Dawit Goji picked up two lifeless chicks in a pen inside a concrete building, shooing away the hundreds that were chirping around them. The power had gone out early that morning, and a crush of chicks stampeded into a corner of the building in an effort to stay warm.
Mr. Goji, who is farming chickens for the first time this year, bent over a chick lying on its side.
"He's about to go," Mr. Goji said, stroking the chick.

Full text: Brazil inaugurates its new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on Sunday. Facing investigations, former President Jair Bolsonaro has taken refuge in Orlando.
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took the reins of the Brazilian government on Sunday in an elaborate inauguration, complete with a motorcade, music festival and hundreds of thousands of supporters filling the central esplanade of Brasília, the nation's capital.
But one key person was missing: the departing far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.
Mr. Bolsonaro was supposed to pass Mr. Lula the presidential sash on Sunday, an important symbol of the peaceful transition of power in a nation where many people still recall the 21-year military dictatorship that ended in 1985.
Instead, Mr. Bolsonaro woke up Sunday thousands of miles away, in a rented house owned by a professional mixed-martial-arts fighter a few miles from Disney World. Facing various investigations from his time in his office, Mr. Bolsonaro flew to Orlando on Friday night and plans to stay in Florida for at least a month.
Mr. Bolsonaro had questioned the reliability of Brazil's election systems for months, without evidence, and when he lost in October, he refused to concede unequivocally. In a sort of farewell address on Friday, breaking weeks of near silence, he said that he tried to block Mr. Lula from taking office but failed.
"Within the laws, respecting the Constitution, I searched for a way out of this," he said. He then appeared to encourage his supporters to move on. "We live in a democracy or we don't," he said. "No one wants an adventure."
On Sunday, Mr. Lula ascended the ramp to the presidential offices with a diverse group of Brazilians, including a Black woman, a disabled man, a 10-year-old boy, an Indigenous man and a factory worker. A voice then announced that Mr. Lula would accept the green-and-yellow sash from "the Brazilian people," and Aline Sousa, a 33-year-old garbage collector, played the role of Mr. Bolsonaro and placed the sash on the new president.
In an address to Congress on Sunday, Mr. Lula said that he would fight hunger and deforestation, lift the economy and try to unite the country. But he also took aim at his predecessor, saying that Mr. Bolsonaro had threatened Brazil's democracy.
"Under the winds of redemocratization, we used to say, 'Dictatorship never again,"' he said. "Today, after the terrible challenge we've overcome, we must say, 'Democracy forever."'
Mr. Lula's ascension to the presidency caps a stunning political comeback. He was once Brazil's most popular president, leaving office with an approval rating above 80 percent. He then served 580 days in prison, from 2018 to 2019, on corruption charges that he accepted a condo and renovations from construction companies bidding on government contracts.
After those convictions were thrown out because Brazil's Supreme Court ruled that the judge in Mr. Lula's case was biased, he ran for the presidency again -- and won.
Mr. Lula, 77, and his supporters maintain that he was the victim of political persecution. Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters say that Brazil now has a criminal as president.
In Brasília, hundreds of thousands of people streamed into the sprawling, planned capital, founded in 1960 to house the Brazilian government, with many dressed in the bright red of Mr. Lula's leftist Workers' Party.
Over the weekend, passengers on arriving planes broke into rally songs about Mr. Lula, revelers danced to samba at New Year's Eve parties and, across the city, spontaneous cries rang out from balconies and street corners, heralding Mr. Lula's arrival and Mr. Bolsonaro's exit.
"Lula's inauguration is mainly about hope," said Isabela Nascimento, 30, a software developer walking to the festivities on Sunday. "I hope to see him representing not only a political party, but an entire population -- a whole group of people who just want to be happier."
Yet elsewhere in the city, thousands of Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters remained camped outside the army headquarters, as they have been since the election, many saying they were convinced that at the final moment on Sunday, the military would prevent Mr. Lula from taking office.
"The army has patriotism and love for the country, and in the past, the army did the same thing," Magno Rodrigues, 60, a former mechanic and janitor who gives daily speeches at the protests, said on Saturday, referring to the 1964 military coup that ushered in the dictatorship.
Mr. Rodrigues has spent the past nine weeks sleeping in a tent on a narrow pad with his wife. He provided a tour of the encampment, which had become a small village since Mr. Bolsonaro lost the election. It has showers, a laundry service, cellphone-charging stations, a hospital and 28 food stalls.
The protests have been overwhelmingly nonviolent -- with more praying than rioting -- but a small group of people have set fire to vehicles. Mr. Lula's transitional government had suggested that the encampments would not be tolerated for much longer.
How long was Mr. Rodrigues prepared to stay? "As long as it takes to liberate my country," he said. "For the rest of my life if I have to."
The absence of Mr. Bolsonaro and the presence of thousands of protesters who believe the election was stolen illustrate the deep divide and tall challenges that Mr. Lula faces in his third term as president of Latin America's biggest country and one of the world's largest democracies.
He oversaw a boom in Brazil from 2003 to 2011, but the country was not nearly as polarized then, and the economic tailwinds were far stronger. Mr. Lula's election caps a leftist wave in Latin America, with six of the region's seven largest countries electing leftist leaders since 2018, fueled by an anti-incumbent backlash.
Mr. Bolsonaro's decision to spend at least the first weeks of Mr. Lula's presidency in Florida shows his unease about his future in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro, 67, is linked to five separate inquiries, including one into his release of documents related to a classified investigation, another on his attacks on Brazil's voting machines and another into his potential connections to "digital militias" that spread misinformation on his behalf.
As a regular citizen, Mr. Bolsonaro will now lose the prosecutorial immunity he had as president. Some cases against him will probably be moved to local courts from the Supreme Court.
Some top federal prosecutors who have worked on the cases believe there is enough evidence to convict Mr. Bolsonaro, particularly in the case related to the release of classified material, according to a top federal prosecutor who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential investigations.
On Sunday, Mr. Lula told Congress that Mr. Bolsonaro could face consequences. "We have no intention of revenge against those who tried to subjugate the nation to their personal and ideological plans, but we will guarantee the rule of law," he said. "Those who have done wrong will answer for their mistakes."
It is unlikely that Mr. Bolsonaro's presence in the United States could protect him from prosecution in Brazil. Still, Florida has become a sort of refuge for conservative Brazilians in recent years.
Prominent pundits on some of Brazil's most popular talk shows are based in Florida. A far-right provocateur who faces arrest in Brazil for threatening judges has lived in Florida as he awaits a response to his political asylum request in the United States. And Carla Zambelli, one of Mr. Bolsonaro's top allies in Brazil's Congress, fled to Florida for nearly three weeks after she was filmed pursuing a man at gunpoint on the eve of the election.
Mr. Bolsonaro plans to stay in Florida for one to three months, giving him some distance to observe whether Mr. Lula's administration will push any of the investigations against him, according to a close friend of the Bolsonaro family who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private plans. The Brazilian government has also authorized four aides to spend a month in Florida with Mr. Bolsonaro, according to an official notice.
On Saturday, Mr. Bolsonaro greeted his new neighbors in the driveway of his rented Orlando house, many of them Brazilian immigrants who took selfies with the departing president. He then went to a KFC to eat.
It is not uncommon for former heads of state to live in the United States for posts in academia or similar ventures. But it is unusual for a head of state to seek safe haven in the United States from possible prosecution at home, particularly when the home country is a democratic U.S. ally.
Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies argue that he is a political target of Brazil's left and particularly Brazil's Supreme Court. They have largely dropped claims that the election was rigged because of voter fraud but instead now claim that it was unfair because Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who runs Brazil's election agency, tipped the scales for Mr. Lula.
Mr. Moraes was an active player in the election, suspending the social-media accounts of many of Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters and granting Mr. Lula more television time because of misleading statements in Mr. Bolsonaro's political ads. Mr. Moraes has said he needed to act to counter the antidemocratic stances of Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters. Some legal experts worry that he abused his power, often acting unilaterally in ways that go far beyond that of a typical Supreme Court judge.
Still, Mr. Bolsonaro has faced widespread criticism, on both the right and the left, for his response to his election loss. After suggesting for months he would dispute any loss -- firing up his supporters and worrying his critics -- he instead went silent, refusing to acknowledge Mr. Lula's victory publicly. His administration carried out the transition as he receded from the spotlight and many of his official duties.
On Saturday night, in his departing speech to the nation, even his vice president, Hamilton Mourão, a former general, made clear his views on Mr. Bolsonaro's final moments as president.
"Leaders that should reassure and unite the nation around a project for the country have let their silence or inopportune and harmful protagonism create a climate of chaos and social disintegration," Mr. Mourão said.

BRASÍLIA, Brazil — President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is expected to take the reins of the Brazilian government Sunday in an elaborate inauguration, complete with a motorcade, music festival and hundreds of thousands of supporters filling the central esplanade of Brasília, the nation’s capital.
But one key person will be missing: the departing far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.
Without him, there will be no ceremonial passing of the presidential sash Sunday, an important symbol of the peaceful transition of power in a nation where many people still recall the 21-year military dictatorship that ended in 1985.
Instead, Bolsonaro woke up Sunday 6,000 miles away, in a rented house owned by a professional mixed-martial-arts fighter a few miles from Disney World. Facing various investigations from his time in his office, Bolsonaro flew to Orlando on Friday night and plans to stay in Florida for at least a month.
Bolsonaro had questioned the reliability of Brazil’s election systems for months, without evidence, and when he lost in October, he refused to concede unequivocally. In a sort of farewell address Friday, breaking weeks of near silence, he said he tried to block Lula from taking office but failed.
“Within the laws, respecting the constitution, I searched for a way out of this,” he said. He then appeared to encourage his supporters to move on. “We live in a democracy or we don’t,” he said. “No one wants an adventure.”
That message did not appear to resonate with many supporters. Thousands remained camped outside the army headquarters in Brasília, as they have been since the election, many saying they were convinced that at the final moment Sunday, the military would prevent Lula from taking office.
“The army will step in,” said Magno Rodrigues, 60, a former mechanic and janitor who gives daily speeches at the protests. “The army has patriotism and love for the country, and in the past, the army did the same thing.” He was referencing the 1964 military coup that ushered in the dictatorship.
Rodrigues has spent the past nine weeks camped outside the army headquarters, sleeping in a tent on a narrow pad with his wife. He provided a tour of the encampment, which had become a small village since Bolsonaro lost the election. It has showers, a laundry service, cellphone-charging stations, a hospital, 28 food stalls and even a system for relieving oneself inside the tent.
The Brazilian army has allowed the protesters to remain but has shown no signs of intervening in the government handover. The protests have been overwhelmingly nonviolent — with more praying than rioting — but a small group of people have set fire to vehicles. Lula’s transitional government has suggested that the encampments will not be tolerated for much longer.
How long was Rodrigues prepared to stay? “As long as it takes to liberate my country,” he said, dressed in a leather jacket and leaning on a cane outside the portable toilets. “For the rest of my life if I have to.”
Elsewhere in Brasília, it was a party. Hundreds of thousands of people streamed into the sprawling, planned capital, founded in 1960 to house the Brazilian government, with many dressed in the bright red of Lula’s leftist Workers’ Party.
Passengers on arriving planes broke into rally songs about Lula, revelers danced to samba at New Year’s Eve parties and, across the city, spontaneous cries rang out from balconies and street corners, heralding Lula’s arrival and Bolsonaro’s exit.

Bolsonaro plans to stay in Florida for one to three months, giving him some distance to observe whether Lula’s administration will push any of the investigations against him, according to a close friend of the Bolsonaro family who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private plans.
“He will try to stay low for a while — to disappear,” Constantino said.
On Saturday, Bolsonaro greeted his new neighbors in the driveway of his rented Orlando house, many of them Brazilian immigrants who took selfies with the departing president. He then went to a KFC to eat.
