Full text: "We have this conviction that fine fragrance is like fine wine," said Owen Mears, the founder of Ffern, a line of perfumes based in London. "Everybody knows it's just grapes, but you can't simply recreate it, because there is craft involved." He was drinking tea at the Nine Orchard hotel next to his sister, Emily Cameron, Ffern's creative director.
"Our starting point was doing things really differently," Ms. Cameron said.
Undeniably, their perfumes are made and sold in a manner far different from a fragrance you might pick out at a department store or at Sephora.
Ffern, which Mr. Mears started in 2016, is a subscription service. A space on the ledger, as it's called, costs $ 129 per season and signifies that you want a bottle from the next batch. From then on, you'll get a new scent four times a year, as the seasons change.
Each edition is handmade in small batches in the English countryside from ingredients that are 95 percent natural and aged in barrels. Each scent is produced only for that season, never to be made again, incentivizing subscribers to make sure they collect each precious release.
That may explain the wait list. The number of spots on the ledger are limited, and once it's full, you have to wait for a space to open up. According to the company, the wait list has half a million people on it, and 20,000 people add their names each week.
Jacqueline Peker, a carpet consultant who lives in London, had to wait a few months before she became a member in 2021. "I might have found it on Instagram, or maybe it was one of those word-of-mouth things," she said. "It's not just about the perfume but the ritual and the way it takes you through the year. I was literally just sitting in bed thinking it must be time for the next one."
The perfumes, created by François Robert and Elodie Durande, the company's "noses," are released at the equinox and the solstice. Autumn 24 was quince with notes of jasmine and myrrh; Winter 25, which will come out on Dec. 21, is a rose scent with bergamot and eucalyptus.
Ffern won't disclose how many bottles it makes for each season, but the run of the first scent, called Winter 19, was just 300 bottles.
Mr. Mears, 29, and Ms. Cameron, 35, take pains to explain each scent for subscribers who haven't smelled them. Each release comes with a piece of art. (The autumn 2024 scent, for example, was accompanied by photographs of a still life with quinces by Jamie Beck). Each smell has an evocative back story.
"We have imagined a figure skating through a moonlit landscape of wild ice and frozen forests," reads the description of the Winter 25 scent on their website. And indeed, Mr. Mears and Ms. Cameron had just returned from filming a couple dancing on ice in the Rocky Mountains.
Ffern, which has 35 employees, also has a podcast and maintains an in-house film crew to create short films around each perfume.
"It's not superfluous to the product," Mr. Mears said. "If you're a company that makes shampoo, your product lives or dies by efficacy, and the storytelling is superfluous. The efficacy of a fragrance is the joy a wearer has. We have to immerse them in the world so they can fall in love and feel part of it."
Most Ffern customers are buying the perfumes based on descriptions and reviews on TikTok, Instagram or the review site Fragrantica. That is where the fans come in. They post unboxing videos of social media, send in poems they have written about their favorite scents and paint pictures inspired by them.
The siblings had what Ms. Cameron described as a "folkloric, pagan childhood" in a rural village in Somerset, next door to one of the first biodynamic herb farms in Europe. Many of their early memories involve playing in fields of echinacea and lemongrass and in apple orchards. They also had a great-aunt who was a botanist.
In 2022, they opened a shop in Soho in London, giving nonsubscribers a chance to experience the fragrances firsthand, and they are thinking of adding a shop in New York. The United States is home to their largest number of members. (The company currently ships only to Britain, the United States, Canada and Germany.)
"We never do market research," Ms. Cameron said. "So we didn't realize rhubarb and quince don't have the same connotations in the U.S. But we quite like the divisiveness." Rhubarb, she said, is often associated with strawberry-rhubarb combinations, so the scent is not familiar on its own, and quince is generally more common in Britain.
Each Ffern perfume comes with a small sample so subscribers can try the scent. They can return the unopened full-size bottle if, say, the Spring 25 violet leaf scent, is not for them.
Paul Thomas, a creative director in Cardiff, Wales, hasn't skipped a scent since he joined the ledger in 2021. "Winter 23 reminds me of when I got married," he said. "It's a unisex scent we both share. I love that connection, and we go through a full bottle each season."
The next Ffern project will be starting a farm in Somerset. Mr. Mears and Ms. Cameron have been visiting potential locations on weekends with a very specific vision in mind: to show how their fragrances are made and aged in barrels, to host events, even to create a place to stay overnight. They imagine a landscape evocative of cozy children's books like "The Secret Garden" or "The Wind in the Willows." A walled garden is on the wish list.
The farm is the first Ffern venture for which they have taken outside funding. It is intended to be the culmination of their vision, a way to live the full Ffern lifestyle, if even for an afternoon. Mostly, though, they want to educate.
"From Day 1, that has been out aspiration," Mr. Mears said. "To show what happens with fragrance from this field versus another field."

"Blush is trending," says the makeup artist Ernesto Casillas, referring to the product's ongoing popularity on TikTok. "A lot of people are calling it 'blush blindness' when someone overapplies it." For advice on creating a more nuanced look, we turned to three people well attuned to the product's capabilities: the comedian, actress and "Saturday Night Live" cast member Chloe Fineman, known for her uncanny impressions; the American Ballet Theatre principal dancer James Whiteside, who returns to the stage this month for the company's fall season; and Casillas, whose clients include the actresses Zendaya and Ayo Edebiri. Here are their tips.
Chloe Fineman, 36, comedian and actress
Blush is a survival tool for me, in terms of being like, "I'm healthy! I got sleep! Right...?" I've tried almost every cream blush. I'm packing at least two versions in my purse right now. My tried-and-true is Tata Harper's Peachy, which is also the name of my dog. The bronzy, peachy color makes me look not ill. And Victoria Beckham has amazing stick blushes. I follow the makeup artist Jo Baker and she used this bright orange one on [the actress] Daisy Edgar-Jones. I do have to blend it out, but I like the way it looks.
I spread one or two fingers of blush on the apples of the cheeks, then continue up to my temples. If I have any left over, I put it on my eyelids. And if I want to be like all the makeup girlies, I put it on my nose. I might as well look like the sun touched me for once in my life in New York.
I have the best makeup artist, Daniela Zivkovic, [for "Saturday Night Live"]. For Saturdays, we do powder blush [which can be set] because we have makeup at 8 p.m. that has to last us for the live show at 11:30. Charlotte Tilbury has a highlighter-bronzer that we use; she also makes lovely blush-highlighter palettes. I love Charlotte Tilbury. Her videos are so charming and iconic. Today a package came, and it was a wig like Charlotte's hair that I forgot I ordered at three in the morning, being like, "Oh, I should do an impression."
James Whiteside, 40, dancer and choreographer
I use Sephora's Colorful Blush for pretty much everything -- for the stage, and if I want to look polished for red-carpet events. I keep repurchasing because it's so easy and cheap. I call it Sunburn, and I put it anywhere I would get a burn: my cheeks, the bridge of my nose, my brow bone. Bella [dancer Isabella Boylston] makes fun of me because it's such an extreme color -- it's called Over the Top -- but I apply it really sparingly with an angled brush.
Onstage I also use a tritone bronzer that has highlight, shadow and sort of a rouge. I apply it at the top of my forehead, under my cheekbones -- all over, basically -- to give myself more of a living-creature look as opposed to pale zombie, which is very easily achieved under the bright stage lights. [A good option is Guerlain's Terracotta Light.]
There's also a Fenty Beauty cream blush that I adore. It's a standard grannyish blush color -- very natural-looking, no shimmer.
Ernesto Casillas, 35, makeup artist
There's a three-step blush process I've been doing lately to ensure I get maximum color payoff and glow. I start with a cream blush; I use some by NudeStix, some by Danessa Myricks. Afterward, I'll do a layer of a luminous blush powder to set the cream for longevity. Hourglass makes these amazing palettes. Then I'll go over that with a balmy blush, like Makeup by Mario's, which brings back that dewy, glowy look that powder can't give.
I use brushes for everything. You get more precision. I like Morphe's synthetic M240 Angled Liquid Bronzer Brush for cream blush, and Hakuhodo's fluffier, natural-hair Blush Brush Round and Flat for a powder blush. For the balms, I do sometimes use my fingers because I feel they won't disrupt the foundation underneath.
You can't judge how a blush looks in the pan. You have to test it because your undertone might change the way it looks on you. A lot of cream blushes have a slightly white base, so when you apply them on deeper skin, it can pick up as too ashy. You want to go with a jewel tone.

Full text: "The biggest misconception about brushes is that you need a hundred of them," says the makeup artist Diane Kendal, who's also the creative director of Rabanne Beauty. "Unless you're a pro, it's better to have only a handful and wash them regularly." The New York-based makeup artist Linda Gradin estimates that most people need just three to seven brushes for everyday use -- to even out the skin, add some color to the cheeks and create simple, well-defined eye looks. The best ones can also do double duty; you can apply lipstick with a small, angled eyeliner brush, for example. And while putting on makeup with your fingers can be great -- skin-to-skin contact warms formulas, helping them to blend easily -- you need brushes if you're looking for polish and precision. Here's a breakdown of the essential styles to have on hand, and how to clean them.
Foundation
If you prefer powder foundation, a medium-size brush with loose bristles, such as Real Techniques' Ultra Plush Powder Makeup Brush, can evenly distribute the product for a matte, but not caky, finish. Tightly packed options like Westman Atelier's Clean Foundation Brush are the most effective at moving liquid and cream formulas across the skin, without absorbing too much product or causing it to streak. And a note that while beauty sponges work well for creating a high-coverage, airbrushed finish, they also hold on to more bacteria and dead skin than brushes; save them for the occasional, formal event.
Concealer
When covering up tiny blemishes or hyperpigmentation, many people "go wrong [by] putting too much product on," says the makeup artist Lauren Parsons, which can cause caking and bring more attention to the area. Instead, conceal precisely by using a small-tipped brush, such as Westman Atelier's Spot Check Brush.
To cover up slightly larger areas like under-eye circles, or to contour intricate places like your nose, try a bigger brush with a doe-foot tip, such as Rare Beauty's Liquid Touch Concealer Brush. That type of applicator blends well and can even help "sheer out product into a tinted moisturizer texture," Parsons says.
Cheeks
A good blush and bronzer brush should help you build different levels of color intensity, from a diffused look to a bold flush. Artis's large, rounded Elite Oval 7 is shaped like the apples of the cheeks, allowing you to add a layer of pigment in one swipe -- and it works with cream, liquid and powder formulas. If you're only dabbing on cream or liquid, then Hourglass's No. 15 Blush Brush will get the job done. Alternatively, Patrick Ta's Dual-Ended Blush Brush has both a powder side, with loose bristles and a rounded shape, and a cream or liquid side that's dense and a little flatter at the top.
Eyes
You can create a variety of eye makeup looks with just four basic brush types.
A broad, tapered brush such as Surratt Beauty's Large Classic Shadow Brush is a good choice for sweeping a single shade over the entire lid or blending a dark color into the outer edges to add definition. The tapered end creates some resistance against the skin, Gradin says, making it easier to direct eye shadow.
A small, fluffy brush like Hourglass's No. 4 Crease Brush is best for adding dimension to the creases with dark, neutral colors or creating a smoky eye.
For precise application of shadow or gel liner, a "skinny edge can get into small areas like the lower lash line," Kendal says. Try a slanted brush such as MAC's 263 Synthetic Small Angle Brush, which can also be used for filling in your eyebrows.
"The biggest thing that can change a face with minimal effort is just brushing your eyebrows up," says Parsons. Use a spoolie like MAC's 204 Lash Brush to lift and shape them.
How Do I Clean My Brushes?
"Most people don't clean their brushes anywhere near enough," says Kendal. But product buildup can hinder their performance and cause inflammation and breakouts, says Parsons. She and Gradin both recommend cleaning brushes every other week. Here's a simple and effective routine:
Pour a nickel-size amount of a mild, nonperfumed soap such as Johnson's Head-to-Toe Baby Wash into your palm.
Run the brush's bristles under water and "wash the brush softly [against your palm]," says Gradin, with back-and-forth or circular motions. Repeat until the brush rinses clear.
Squeeze and lightly shape the bristles with your hands to remove as much water as you can.
Leave the brush to dry completely on a paper towel or cloth. "It should be laid flat so that water doesn't drain into the ferrule" -- the metal ring below the bristles -- "and loosen the adhesive" says Kendal.
Use an antibacterial spray, like Sephora's Daily Brush Cleaner, between washes and store your brushes in a separate case from the rest of your makeup so the bristles don't get damaged by other tools, says Gradin. A good option is Kevyn Aucoin's convertible Beauty Pochette. "But it could just be a regular pen case," she adds.

To Persuade a Reluctant Tween to Read, Try Cash: [Op-Ed]

Full text: This summer, I paid my 12-year-old daughter $ 100 to read a book. As far as mom maneuvers go, it was definitely last-ditch, and the size of the payout was certainly excessive. I can't say I am proud -- but I am extremely satisfied. Because the plan worked. It worked so well, I'd suggest that other parents of reluctant readers open their wallets and bribe their kids to read, too.
My daughter is a whip-smart kid, definitely smarter than I was at 12. But until I resorted to bribery, she'd never read an entire chapter book for pleasure. She'd read books for school, but getting her to do that was like pulling teeth, and on her own she'd read a few graphic novels and listened to the audiobooks of the "Harry Potter" series. None of those activities became a gateway to any habit of what I might call classic deep reading -- with two eyes in front of paper, and nothing else going on.
When I faced this truth a few months ago, it felt like a parenting failure. Even though we'd read many storybooks when she was younger and we live in a house stuffed with books, I'd not managed to instill one of life's fundamental pleasures in my kid.
Just before the pandemic, a depressing federal survey revealed how much reading for pleasure had dropped among children. Almost 30 percent of 13-year-olds said they "never or hardly ever" read for fun, a substantial increase from the 8 percent who said the same roughly 35 years earlier. Given that screen time among children also increased significantly during the pandemic, it's fair to conclude that leisure reading is an increasingly endangered pursuit among children.
For those of us who are lifelong readers -- who value our night stands stacked with teetering towers of books; who hold in our minds like friends the ideas and characters we've collected over the years from the printed page -- conveying the importance of reading shouldn't be hard. We all understand how reading enhances the fabric of our experience. Yet I found it weirdly difficult to communicate any of this to my reading-reluctant daughter. She claimed to dislike reading. Furthermore, she didn't care to like it. And she didn't see any of this as a problem. Lots of her friends, she explained to me, just "weren't into" reading. I realized that if I wanted to communicate the joy of reading to my child, I had to clarify what the joy was for myself.
Certainly, my daughter's having landed a smartphone last year -- a secondhand iPhone with a zillion parental controls and time limits baked in -- is part of the problem. Before the phone, I had a child who was like a gregarious Tigger, squealing with delight at something as simple as a new dessert cooling in the fridge. Post-phone, I had a monosyllabic blanket slug who wanted only to stay in her room with the blinds down, door closed, under a duvet, palming that little rectangle as if unhanding it would make her social life disappear. If it wasn't her friends or it wasn't her phone, it was only one thing: "boring."
Have you ever tried cheerfully to tell a nearly-13-year-old enduring a couple of parentally imposed phone blackout hours to pull out the old watercolors set? Or maybe try origami? Unless you want your hair to instantly fall out from teenage eyeballs laser-hating you through tiny slits, I'd suggest don't.
But I held a candle for reading. Because I could see that what my daughter was looking for, like so many her age, was escape. To me, that felt developmentally appropriate. The problem was that the easiest way for her to find escape was to plunge into the addictive chaos of her smartphone.
So I campaigned. I told her she needed to read because novels are the best way to learn about how people's insides work. She said she could learn more from watching the people she followed on social media, who were all about spilling their insides.
I said books offered storytelling. She said, "Netflix."
I said books taught history. She said, "The internet."
I said reading would help her understand herself, and she said, "Um, no thank you. I'll just live."
I promised, extravagantly, that I'd buy her all the books she wanted and construct bookshelves in her room so that she could see the spines of all the books she loved from her bed. She said, "Mama, welcome to your dream."
I could not win our debates, I realized, because few of my daughters' arguments against reading seemed wrong to me. Yes, reading is a way to broaden your universe and discover new worlds -- but so is the entire internet. So these discussions, which annoyed both of us, would inevitably whittle down to my wheedling about cognition and attention and how reading is "good for you."
That's not why I wanted my daughter to pick up a book. It wasn't about optimizing her brain function but about being privy to a certain subtle magic. You know when an author sums up a feeling you didn't even know you've had, and 100 lightbulbs go off in your head in a kind of epiphany? I wanted her to have a chance at feeling that. As Neil Postman wrote in 1982 in "The Disappearance of Childhood," a screen-based medium like TV or video can't create this kind of relationship because, by its nature, the medium must fill in all the blanks for you. Books leave space for blanks -- and for the internal invention they can inspire.
So I decided to cut through all the reasoning with a cold, hard practicality: cash. I told my 12-year-old I would pay her $ 100 to read a novel. She said: "What? Really?"
Then, of course, she said yes.
I canvassed friends with teenagers about what book would work to ignite her reading desire. While some weirdos suggested things like "The Little Prince" and "Wuthering Heights," the book suggested most often by people who know my daughter was Jenny Han's "The Summer I Turned Pretty," which had been turned into a popular Amazon Prime series that my daughter had watched and loved.
I brokered the deal: $ 100 if she finished the book within a month. We then embarked on a beach holiday, along with my boyfriend, to a romantic Greek island -- an extended event involving bathing-suit-clad middle-aged bodies so mortifying to a 12-year-old that it was better not to look up. Perfect!
The holiday was eight days long, and before the seventh day was done, my daughter had finished the book. When we got back home, she asked for the sequel, then finished that one in about two weeks -- at no extra charge.
Will this lead to her reading "Little Women"? To tearing through "Catcher in the Rye" and "White Teeth"? Will it result in a long reading life full of teetering night-stand stacks of books that she will come to see as friends, teachers, cheerleaders and balm for whatever her troubles of the day may be?
I don't know. What I do know is that my daughter now has $ 100 worth of new Sephora items that I'd spent the past year refusing to purchase. I also know that together, we finally opened a new portal for her to the printed page: a quiet personal place that I imagine -- I hope -- will serve her for a lifetime. That feels like the best money I ever spent.

Usual Tools Can't Help China to Fix Its Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A real estate collapse has made consumers cautious and businesses wary, as China confronts a crisis unlike any other since it opened its economy to the world.
In 2004, as China's economy was emerging as a global force, a group of researchers started conducting nationwide surveys asking Chinese people if they were better off financially than they were five years earlier.
The percentage who felt wealthier climbed when surveyed five years later and again in 2014, when it reached a high of 77 percent.
Last year, when respondents were asked the same question, that figure dropped to 39 percent.
The results of that survey, titled "Getting Ahead in Today's China: From Optimism to Pessimism," speak to a new reality. China's economy is confronting a crisis unlike any it has experienced since it opened its economy to the world more than four decades ago. The post-Covid rebound that was supposed to bring the economy roaring back to life was more like a whimper.
A few years ago, Beijing resolved to wean its economy from its dependence on an overheated real estate market, a sector that had underpinned the savings of families as well as China's banking sector and local government finances. Now, the property sector is in crisis. Developers collapsed, leaving behind huge debts, a trail of failed investments, unsold apartments and lost jobs.
Chinese consumers, already prone to saving heavily, have become even more frugal. Businesses that endured the crippling impact of draconian Covid measures have cut salaries and scaled back hiring. Millions of college graduates joining the job market are facing long odds and poor prospects. And China's population has shrunk two years in a row. In a country where the majority of people had only known the economy to grow rapidly and living conditions to improve, confidence is eroding.
Sherry Yang opened her business in 2006 making store signs, billboards and posters in Sichuan Province in southwestern China. Within a few years, local firms were placing so many orders that Ms. Yang had 16 employees and her printing machines were running around the clock.
But the business has never fully recovered after Covid, she said. This summer, already sluggish demand worsened; sales in July fell 70 percent from a year earlier. Ms. Yang said it felt like every industry was struggling and no one was spending.
Ms. Yang is down to six employees, many of whom spend the day scrolling their phones because there isn't enough work.
"This has been the most difficult year since our opening," she said.
Consumer spending, which Chinese authorities have identified as an important driver of growth, remains weak across the economy.
Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce firm, said sales in its domestic online shopping business fell 1 percent in the spring. China's summer movie box office sales have dropped by almost half over last year, according to Maoyan, an entertainment data provider. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast in August that Chinese consumers would cut back on buying pork and shift to cheaper beef, because of economic pressures.
A number of foreign firms that once rushed into China to catch a rising tide are now retrenching. Last month, the beauty retailer Sephora, an arm of the French luxury group LVMH, announced that it was cutting jobs because of "the challenging market." IBM is shutting its two research and development centers in China.
And policymakers trying to respond are hindered because they cannot rely on a principal fix that worked in the past. For years, local governments borrowed money for splashy development projects that kept people working and the construction sector booming -- even if there wasn't an actual need for that much infrastructure.
But the debt from that borrowing, often funneled through opaque funding channels, has ballooned to more than $ 7 trillion. With investors already jittery about China's financial system, the days of lavish borrowing for vanity infrastructure are unlikely to return anytime soon.
The Chinese government has signaled its alarm by restricting access to data about the markets and economy. Last year, it suspended releasing youth unemployment figures when the number reached record highs. It started distributing the information again this year, with a new methodology that lowered the figures.
To quell discussion of a major economic crisis, officials have warned some economists not to draw public comparisons between China's problems and the collapse of Japan's debt-fueled property bubble in the 1980s, which weighed on its economy for decades.
China's debt is difficult to ignore, however.
While the housing sector's collapse has caused much collateral damage, the risk of insolvency is minimized by China's tightly controlled financial system. The danger is that the government could have fewer fiscal resources to deploy to keep things from unraveling.
"The consequences for this fiscal crisis is less growth," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region at the investment bank Natixis.
The economic uncertainty has left Chinese savers and foreign investors alike scrambling for safe places to park their money. Real estate prices continue to plunge, and Chinese stocks are underperforming compared with those in just about every other major country, including the United States, Japan and India.
Foreign funds have turned into net sellers of Chinese equities in 2024, which would be the first annual outflow since the data became available a decade earlier. Shares of around 180 Chinese companies have been removed from a critical stock market index since the start of the year, reducing the presence of Chinese firms in global benchmarks.
Investors have retreated to the safety of China's bond market, driving up prices and pushing down yields. But even that comes with a potential risk. Yields collapsed so drastically that the country's central bank is now concerned that it might leave banks vulnerable if interest rates rise in the future.
Chinese investors have also piled into gold, helping drive prices to record highs.
China has forecast that its economy will grow about 5 percent this year, a faster rate than most major economies, although that may now be in doubt. A record-setting surge in exports, flooding the world with electric vehicles, batteries and household appliances, is fueling China's economic growth. But the resulting glut of supply is also undermining the profitability of the high-tech manufacturing industries that China had hoped would soften the blow of its painful shift from real-estate-led growth, while drawing a backlash from a growing number of major trading partners.
For its part, China has downplayed economic concerns. In an April opinion article in state media, Jin Ruiting, director of the Institute of International Economics at the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research, said Western media and politicians continued to "make a fuss about China's short-term economic fluctuations," while "unilaterally exaggerating the problems and challenges of the Chinese economy."
But fundamental problems remain.
For a vast number of young people, there are not enough jobs. In July, China's unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds jumped above 17 percent, from 13 percent in June.
Winnie Chen graduated this summer with an auditing degree in Nanchang, a southeastern Chinese city. She took the civil service exam in March but didn't land a job, competing against hundreds of applicants for every available position.
She started looking for private-sector jobs. Ms. Chen messaged 1,229 companies on a job-seeking app and applied for 119 jobs in accounting, e-commerce, social media and other industries. After dozens of interviews, she said, she scored a few job offers -- but all came with "absurd" conditions.
One job had a starting salary of $ 380 a month, which she considered too low to live on. Another company offered her a position, but said she would have to work on public holidays and not get any days off in return. She was offered a position she was told was for a makeup artist, but declined after learning she would actually have to work in a nightclub.
"It feels like there are too many college graduates now, too many people but too few jobs," Ms. Chen said, noting that many of her classmates were jobless. "The economy is in a bad state."

Myron E. Ullman III, Executive Who Remade Macy's, Dies at 77: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a leader behind many of the world's best-known brands, he exuded operational know-how. He also displayed a rare humility, which helped drive his success.
Myron E. Ullman III, the unassuming retail executive who gave Macy's a strategic makeover, revitalized J.C. Penney during two stints as chief executive, and held key positions at Starbucks and the French conglomerate LVMH, died on Aug. 6 in Grand Junction, Colo. He was 77.
His wife, Cathy Emmons Ullman, said the cause of his death, at a hospice facility, was complications of Alzheimer's disease, cancer and other ailments. For much of his career, Mr. Ullman zipped through store aisles on a Segway scooter because of a progressive neurological condition that made walking difficult.
In a business of grandiose personalities, Mr. Ullman stood out for being a measured executive with a keen analytical mind and an intense focus on customer satisfaction, which included stocking merchandise and sizes that were popular in local communities.
"I think the best shopping experience is when there really is a stimulating environment -- things you haven't seen before, variety, newness and freshness," Mr. Ullman told Women's Wear Daily in 2015. "Its hard to describe, but you know it when you feel it."
He was operationally shrewd and lacking in bravado.
"He never sought the spotlight, and he really defined for me and others what servant leadership truly means," Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, where Mr. Ullman was a director and chairman, said in an interview. "The success that Starbucks enjoyed while he was the lead director, and at my side, is very hard to even measure. It's incomparable."
Mr. Ullman didn't start in retail. After working for IBM as an international account manager and serving as vice president for business affairs at the University of Cincinnati -- his alma mater -- he joined Federated Department Stores in 1982 as an executive vice president at its Sanger-Harris department store chain in Dallas.
Four years later, he became managing director of Wharf Holdings, a real estate investment group in Hong Kong. There he met Edward Finkelstein, the flamboyant chief executive of Macy's, which was nearing bankruptcy.
Mr. Finkelstein hired Mr. Ullman in 1988 to impose financial controls and reshape the company's strategy; for example, he stocked stores with merchandise that more closely reflected the tastes and figures of local shoppers. To do so, Mr. Ullman introduced computerized systems that tracked customer preferences so store managers and buyers could react rapidly to changing trends.
"He was very good about doing the dirty work, the operational stuff, making sure that store operations were working functionally well," Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, said in an interview.
But the underlying financial troubles at Macy's were too much to overcome. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1992, and Mr. Finkelstein resigned. Mr. Ullman took over, but he left after Federated Department Stores bought the company in 1995.
Not long after, Mr. Ullman became the chief executive of DFS Group, a chain of duty-free luxury outlets in airports. LVMH -- led by Bernard Arnault, widely considered the most powerful figure in retail -- bought a controlling stake in DFS Group in 1996. Mr. Ullman became LVMH's second in command.
While he was working at LVMH, a progressive neurological condition that doctors struggled to diagnose grew more debilitating. He retired in 2002. After moving to a ranch in Colorado, he joined the boards of several corporations, including Starbucks in 2003. He became the company's chairman in 2018 and held that position until 2021.
In 2004, J.C. Penney approached him about becoming chief executive. The company was facing fierce competition from Macy's, Target, the Gap, T.J. Maxx and online shopping. To Mr. Ullman, the offer was tantalizing -- and not just because of the operational challenges.
"I was grieving the fact that I had to leave because of my disability," he told The Wall Street Journal in 2009. "That was not the right way to end my career."
At J.C. Penney, he added popular higher-end lines like the makeup brand Sephora and Polo by Ralph Lauren. He revamped the company's marketing, introducing an ad with the tagline "Stepping Up Our Style." And he daringly opened a store near Herald Square in Manhattan, home to the flagship of his former company, Macy's.
"We're the David, and they're the Goliath across the street," Mr. Ullman told sales associates at the store's opening.
In 2005, J.C. Penney's operating profit jumped 22.5 percent from the previous year, to $ 1.6 billion.
"It's quite a departure from your mother's J.C. Penney," Mr. Ullman told investors at the company's annual meeting in 2006. "Our long-range plan is designed to make J.C. Pen­ney a leader in the retail industry, and our excellent performance in the first year of this plan underscores that we are well on our way."
Still, there were significant headwinds for department stores -- especially with customers shifting to specialty stores and discount retailers. And from 2007 to 2009, the Great Recession hammered the entire retail industry. Activist shareholders, including William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, ultimately forced Mr. Ullman out in 2011. His replacement was Ron Johnson, the former head of Apple's retail stores.
Taking the reins with "celebratory bravado," as an advertising agency blog said, Mr. Johnson tried to make stores more hip with in-store boutiques. He also introduced a "fair and square pricing" policy that eliminated discounts -- which had the unintended result of making customers feel that they were no longer getting good deals.
"Fourteen months later, J.C. Penney is America's favorite cautionary tale," the business writer James Surowiecki wrote in The New Yorker. "Customers have abandoned the store en masse: over the past year, revenues have fallen by twenty-five per cent, and Penney lost almost a billion dollars, half a billion of it in the final quarter alone."
Mr. Johnson was fired. J.C. Penney rehired Mr. Ullman, who brought back his original initiatives, dismantled Mr. Johnson's and was credited with stabilizing the company.
Myron Edward Ullman III, known as Mike, was born on Nov. 26, 1946, in Youngstown, Ohio, to Myron Edward Ullman Jr., a mechanical engineer and designer, and June (Cunningham) Ullman. He grew up in nearby Canfield.
He studied business at the University of Cincinnati and graduated in 1969. The university awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2006.
Mr. Ullman served on the boards of numerous charities, including Mercy Ships International, which sends hospital ships to coastal Africa to provide medical care.
He married Cathy Emmons in 1969. In addition to her, he is survived by their six children, Cayce, Tryan, Peter, Kyrk, Kwynn and Maddy Ullman; his siblings Chris Stubbins, Gretchen Tisone, Curt Ullman and Greg Ullman; and six grandchildren. Two siblings, Carl Ullman and Deborah Shaw, died before him.
Mr. Ullman's wife said shopping with him could be disappointing. He was only ever interested in analyzing a store's layout, customer service and merchandise offerings.
"When you went to a store with him, you weren't shopping," she said. "You were just walking the store to see how everything worked."

Aiming to Make the Lamborghini of Skin Care: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dermatologist Antony Nakhla created a beauty brand for his clients who include some of Southern California's most pampered people. But he wondered: Could he also get them to use sunscreen?
Before he introduced his skin care line, Dr. Antony Nakhla, a Newport Beach, Calif. based dermatologist, would frequently vet the products his patients were using. More often than not, he was unimpressed.
"I was taken aback by how much these things cost and what was actually in them," he said, sitting in a small outdoor area at the Whitby Hotel on a recent trip to New York. "If you buy a Lamborghini and you look under the hood, I can tell you why it costs this much," he added. "With luxury products and skin care, when you look at the ingredient list, there's really nothing in there of real value."
Dr. Nakhla wanted to develop something worth the money. So in 2016, thinking of starting his own brand, he began researching ingredients. He created what he calls a "Peptide-rich Plasma" -- a patent-pending mix of laboratory-produced extracts that he said are identical, on a molecular level, to what's already in human skin. Peptides can help hide the skin's signs of aging, which often become more pronounced as aging skin begins to lose collagen.
When he was satisfied with the formulas, with the high concentration of active ingredients and patented technology that is typically why certain brands cost more than drugstore ones, Dr. Nakhla invested several hundred thousand dollars of his own money to start his company, hoping that the business could go from "expensive science project to enterprise," he said.
He named the company Eighth Day to express his view that, "you look best when you look like yourself, and that beauty transcends time," he said.
But this comes at a cost, in this case a steep one: Products range from $ 85 for face cleanser that lasts 4-6 weeks, to $ 450 for a 50 milliliter bottle of serum that claims to improve a long list of aging-related skin woes, like wrinkles, reduced elasticity, loss of volume and dullness.
Despite their prices, his products seem to be gaining a following by word of mouth: When Eighth Day's Regenerative Serum became available on the luxury beauty boutique and website Violet Grey, it "sold out three times in the first two months," wrote Sarah Brown, the retailer's chief brand officer, in an email (the company wouldn't share the volume or sales figures). Investors are taking note. Last year, Elevate Beauty, a division of the private equity firm L Catterton that has minority stakes in companies such as DIBS Beauty, acquired a minority share in the company. (Neither Elevate or Dr. Nakhla would share the precise amount of the investment.)
Beyond Wrinkles
Dr. Nakhla has been based in California since 2006 but considers himself "an East Coast guy." The son of Egyptian immigrants, he and his two older sisters grew up between Ridgefield Park and Jersey City. He knew he wanted to be a doctor by the time he went to college, and earned a degree in osteopathic medicine at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 2004. Mohs surgery (the process of removing skin cancer in precise stages, so as not to harm healthy tissue and minimize scarring) has become a big part of his work -- he performs it on about 75 percent of his patients.
His collection's most recent addition, the Rejuvenating Moisturizing Primer Broad Spectrum, is a zinc-based sunscreen without the chalkiness of many mineral products. At $ 140, the matte lotion is about 10 times the price of a tube of Banana Boat's mineral sunscreen.
Does the world really need another doctor-founded skin care line?
"There are so many products by so many physicians," said Dr. Seth Matarasso, president of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. (Dr. Nakhla is a member of the organization, although Dr. Matarasso doesn't know him personally.) "I think we're almost cannibalizing -- this physician claims this and this physician claims that. One doesn't know who or what to believe."
Many celebrity skin care lines are developed with the input of doctors, presumably with the notion that it lends credibility. Take, for example, Dr. Jean-Louis Sebagh, who worked with Cindy Crawford on her Meaningful Beauty line and appeared regularly in its frequently aired infomercials. Pharrell Williams's skin care line, Humanrace, was tested by his dermatologist, Dr. Elena Jones; Rhode, Hailey Bieber's brand, was made with input from Dr. Dhaval Bhanusali, a dermatologist, and Dr. Ron Robinson, a cosmetic chemist.
"People are not over the doctor thing," said Larissa Jensen, the global beauty industry advisor at Circana, a research company devoted to consumer shopping habits. Sales of clinical prestige brands sold by retailers like Sephora were $ 723 million in the first quarter of this year, up about 8 percent versus the same period last year, according to Circana. In a consumer survey the company issued last May, nearly 60 percent of respondents said they sought out brands endorsed by a dermatologist or doctor.
Susan Martin, 49, a Manhattan-based event planner who loves skin care, is one of those consumers. When she's shopping, she said in a phone interview, she looks for "Doctor things paired with clinical research that shows results." She's purchased products from Dr. Nicholas Perricone's popular line, for example, and Kaplan MD, developed by a Beverly Hills-based dermatologist, among others.
But for customers to remain loyal, products need to perform the skin care miracles they promise. "At the end of the day, skin care is about efficacy," Ms. Jensen said. "They're looking for products that will work."
Ms. Jensen added: "There is an inherent expertise that underlies clinical and doctor brands versus others."
Beauty shoppers have increasingly higher expectations about the products they buy, fueled in part by the amount of information and tutorials, frequently from influencers, on social media and outlets like YouTube. "They're getting into the technical terms, so we've got to make sure that we're bringing product to them that has that efficacy, the high performance, and providing things that they're looking for," said Debra Redmond, who oversees the selection of beauty brands at Nordstrom.
When it comes to the habits of beauty shoppers, "A doctor's name on a bottle might be the initial grab," said Cori Aleardi, one of the founders of Elevate Beauty, but, she added, "they are not stupid."

Teen Looks, Ever in Flux: [Style Desk]

Full text: Youth might be wasted on the young, but beauty trends rarely miss them. While a spate of recent headlines have centered on the "Sephora teens" who run like wolf packs through the aisles of the personal-care retailer, snapping up rarefied lotions and lash-growth serums, the adolescent urge for transformation is hardly new.
The concept of teenagers as their own distinct marketing demographic first emerged during the postwar boom of the 1940s, though for many years the products catering to them remained relatively modest: a pink froth of bubble bath, a smattering of Lip Smacker lip balm.
This year, the global beauty industry is projected to generate more than $ 600 billion in revenue, with an 8 percent rise among teen and tween consumers alone. (Whether a 12-year-old actually needs a "visibly firming," $ 48 Brazilian Bum Bum Cream is another story.) Below, a partial look back at the last eight-plus decades of shimmer sticks and zeitgeist shifts.
1940s
The start of Seventeen, and a democratic lipstick
The debut of Seventeen magazine in 1944 helped to promote a fresh-faced glow via products such as Pond's Angel Face Powder and growing brands like Tangee, whose best-selling lipstick contained a fluorescein dye that changed color upon skin contact to uniquely suit the wearer, or so the company claimed. (Though its relevance faded by the late '60s, you can still find the line's signature shade today at The Vermont Country Store, following a 2002 revival.)
Also emerging around this time: The popularity of miniature products -- known as "ten-cent sizes" and initially sold as samples -- as a boon to girls with little experience and limited money to spend.
1950s
A bath-time fairy tale
In 1952, a British businessman acquired the trademark rights to "Tinkerbell" and began manufacturing toiletries and cosmetics designed specifically for young girls. The line would go on to feature an enduringly popular line of bath products, lipsticks and "Bo-Po" peelable nail polish, though the company eschewed eye shadow or mascara. ("We don't want to tell an 8-year-old that she should look like she's 18," the company's president told The New York Times in 1989.)
Alas, it was all headed for Neverland; by the turn of the millennium, an ongoing lawsuit with Disney over naming rights shuttered the brand for good.
1960s
Mod squads and beehives
Enter the youthquake, and with it a new era of marketable teen-dom -- perhaps most memorably embodied by the lithe early supermodel Twiggy, whose exaggerated Bambi-like under-lashes, pixie haircut and pale lips made her a star at 16. For that look, false eyelash strips were a must, as well as bright pencils and powders from Cover Girl, Max Factor or Maybelline.
Also all the rage, if considerably less low maintenance than the pixie: beehive hairdos, initially created by a Chicago beautician named Margaret Vinci Heldt and soon adopted by rising girl groups like the Supremes and the Ronettes. "It's all about Aqua Net, and then teasing it, and then more Aqua Net, and then teasing it a little more," Ronnie Spector, the Ronettes' famously diminutive lead singer, explained in a 2010 interview.
1970s
A natural shift
As mod gave way to the Woodstock generation and later the dawning of disco, looks both softened and expanded to convey a more carefree kind of glamour (see the fragrant rise of groovy shampoos like Clairol Herbal Essences and Gee, Your Hair Smells Terrific).
Bonne Bell Lip Smacker, introduced in 1973, let teens eschew the waxen, heavily pigmented lipsticks of their mothers' era in favor of sheer balms in collectible flavors like strawberry, green apple and Dr Pepper. (For the girl perhaps a little more versed in the ways of romance, there was Maybelline Kissing Potion, a roll-on lip gloss available in cheeky formulations like "Provocative Pineapple," "Wild Watermelon" and "Devil Mint.")
Also new in 1973: Fashion Fair Cosmetics, which was among the first mass brands to cater to Black beauty needs. At the same time, the unfettered hair of counterculture icons such as the political activist Angela Davis signaled a shift away from damaging straighteners toward products like Afro Sheen that celebrated natural textures.
1980s
Beauty goes pop
A booming economy, and the big hair to match: The Greed Decade welcomed the rise of crimping tools, Ogilvie home perms and other products designed to pump up the volume.
Many teens chose to boost their spiral perms with Sun In -- the heat-activated spray that promised natural highlights, though it more often delivered unseemly streaks of metallic orange. And to sweep those curls up, preferably to one puffy side? Enter the scrunchie, that wrist-ready twist of fabric and elastic first patented by a former nightclub singer named Rommy Hunt Revson. (Or in a literal pinch, there were always banana clips.)
Makeup of the '80s, too, had little use for subtlety -- whether in bright neons, frosted pastels or the saturated shades (teal, orchid, cobalt) produced in teen-friendly price ranges by Wet n Wild. Later, it could all be wiped off with a bracing swipe of Sea Breeze astringent, and the after-burn covered with a crop-dusting spritz of Electric Youth, Love's Baby Soft or Malibu Musk.
The bulky, ubiquitous vessel in which to stash all this bounty: a Caboodle, the brightly colored, multilevel case inspired, legend has it, by a fishing tackle box that Vanna White used to organize her cosmetics on the set of "Wheel of Fortune."
1990s
Alt nation
While corporations targeted the emerging "alternative" sensibilities of a young and jaded Generation X, beauty also turned away from '80s glam and excess: MAC Cosmetics, a Canadian brand, offered matte, densely pigmented products in browns, burgundies and taupes, and subtler shimmers replaced frost.
The irreverent print magazine Sassy reflected the shift, crystallizing trends that ranged from Bantu knots and baby barrettes to belly button rings. (Piercings emerged in other spots too: eyebrows, noses, nipples.)
The decade was not all earth tones and overtweezed eyebrows, though; Manic Panic hair dye, vegan and cruelty-free, came in a spectrum of screaming colors available to any rebellious kid with a sink and a comb, and brash new groups like the Spice Girls and Destiny's Child embodied the panoply of looks (cyberpunk, sporty, baby-doll) that filtered down from the pop charts to the local mall.
2000s
Pop-punk hair and body sprays
As grunge receded and MTV's "Total Request Live" era entered the chat, things got a little shinier and more girlish again: butterfly hair clips, eye shadows in Easter-basket hues, lip products so high gloss that they looked like car paint.
The rise of emo and pop punk also brought a new coed twist to grooming: the boom in so-called "guyliner" for boys, along with assiduously flat-ironed hair for all. The upstart makeup line Urban Decay offered more genderless options in provocatively named shades (Absinthe, Gangrene, Asphyxia) that deliberately eschewed "pretty."
Fragrances could be unisex, too -- see the enduring appeal of CK One, introduced in 1994 -- but mass-market offerings like Axe body spray, introduced by Unilever in 2002, helped to democratize scent, steeping a generation of teenage boys in an ambient, often eye-watering cloud of musk and metrosexuality.
Was it deodorant, cologne or chemical warfare? Ask the girls who drenched themselves in analogous potions from Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret Pink, their candy-colored mists aggressively evoking melons, berries or warm cookies.
2010s
Celebrity beauty and social influencers
The continued rise of social media and YouTube helped to spread the gospel of previously niche items like nail art, Korean skin care or ombré hair via self-styled influencers and "get ready with me" videos. Increasingly, too, the messenger was as notable as the medium, thanks to product lines from celebrities including Lady Gaga (Haus Labs) and Kylie Jenner (Kylie Cosmetics), who cannily extended (and monetized) their brands.
Suddenly, any sophomore could learn to contour like a Kardashian -- and with the 2017 introduction of Rihanna's shade-inclusive Fenty Beauty, find a range of foundations in tints that actually matched their skin tone. (In its first year, The Times reported, Fenty surpassed $ 500 million in revenue; Jenner's line, as of 2019, was valued at $ 1.2 billion.)
And every era has its of-the-moment lip balm; the 2010s belonged to EOS, the spherical (if controversial) pastel ball tucked into the skinny jeans of Millennial icons like Britney Spears and Hilary Duff.
2020s
The TikTok takeover
Glazed Donut, Strawberry Girl, Coquette, Cottage-core: The ascendancy of TikTok-driven micro trends has often made beauty feel like a game of free association or a chaotic grocery list. Even faux freckles became a viral hit when applied with a broccoli floret. (No, really.)
And broccoli is also for boys, as evidenced by the highly meme-able haircut of the same name (long on top, cropped or faded on the sides). All genders took cues from "Euphoria," the boundary-pushing HBO show whose high school hallways spilled over with eye gems, bright irridescents and other outré looks.
But even amid the dizzying churn -- one day, it's bows or Barbie; the next, Brazilian Bum Bum Cream -- come reminders that these are, after all, just kids. Witness the ongoing popularity of the pimple patch: once a deliberately low-key spot treatment, now a statement piece worn publicly in bold, Lisa Frank-style colors and shapes.
At a moment when the machinery of trendmaking has rarely felt more outlandish or frankly overwhelming, it's a sweet idea: Rather than burying so-called flaws in shame and coverup, stamp them proudly with a gold star.

Gen Z Males Fall for Rock-Hard Gum: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Young men are buying "Facial Fitness" chewing gum that promises to bulk up their jawlines. But dentists say the products are not particularly effective or safe.
A square-jawed young man faces the camera and tells viewers that they, too, can have the facial architecture of Clark Kent. He runs a finger along his jawline as if it really could cut glass.
Near the end of the video, one of many similar testimonials on TikTok and YouTube, he credits his chiseled appearance to his habit of gnawing on extra-hard chewing gum.
It might come from a brand like Stronger Gum, which claims that its product can sculpt customers' jawlines within two weeks, or Jawcko, which offers tough gum in flavors like "Muscle Mango" and "Jacked Watermelon."
A growing number of Gen Z men are seeking out stiff chewing gum from brands that claim their products will build up chewers' jaw muscles, giving them a more conventionally masculine look. Teenage boys hoping to improve their attractiveness in "looksmaxxing" communities online are encountering an explosion of gum brands that position their products as the facial equivalent of a Spartan workout routine.
"Say goodbye to a weak chin and hello to a jawline that commands attention," Jawliner, a brand that sells "Facial Fitness" chewing gum, says on its website.
The products are reaching young customers despite their cost. Jawliner has sold more than one million pouches of its gum, which usually sell for $ 26 and contain around 60 pieces, since the product was introduced in 2022, according to Tiffany Tran, a spokeswoman for the company. She added that 60 percent of those customers were ages 18 to 25.
Antonio Eversgerd, 17, a rising senior in Mandeville, La., ordered a package of hard gum on Amazon after seeing a YouTube video that claimed it would help him grow larger jaw muscles. Several of his classmates and his 15-year-old brother's friends chew it, too. "It's all over social media," he said.
His mother, a cosmetic dentist, made him throw it away. Lately, Dr. Daniela Eversgerd, who often treats temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, has been getting questions about hard gum from two or three young patients each month, she estimated. Some of them have come in with jaw pain or damaged fillings that she said had most likely been caused by excessive chewing.
"You would have to chew gum for so long, for eight hours a day for years and years, to get the effect that they're looking for," Dr. Eversgerd said. "The risks definitely outweigh the benefits."
The gum has been circulating since around 2021 in online forums populated by "looksmaxxers," Gen Z's term for young men who exchange often dubious tips for enhancing their appearances. It got a signal boost this year from the 19-year-old influencer Dillon Latham, who posted about it in January, and the neuroscientist and podcaster Andrew Huberman, who mentioned a version called mastic gum in an episode of his podcast in February. (Mastic, a tree resin whose use dates to ancient Greece, has also been swept up in the looksmaxxing cause.)
Hard gum has also become a frequent recommendation in Reddit groups dedicated to "mewing," an unproven technique for defining the jawline that traveled from incel communities online toward the mainstream.
Carson Teagarden, a 19-year-old fitness content creator in Waynesburg, Pa., decided he wanted to try the gum after scrolling past models' bulging jaw muscles on social media. "Especially at my age, everyone's wanting to get girls and look the best they can," he said. "It kind of makes you wonder, 'Oh, maybe I need to get a jawline, too."'
The influencers promoting the gum are often doing so for a profit. Mr. Teagarden said that after he tested Jawliner gum in a recent TikTok video that was viewed over a million times, about 200 people bought the gum through the link he provided on his TikTok Shop page. He said he earned around $ 5 per order.
Recent articles in The Cut and CBS News have noted the sparse evidence that chewing gum can actually change one's appearance. Gum companies point to a 2018 study with just 19 participants that suggested that gum chewing could increase bite force, and a 2019 study that found a hard diet changed jaw structure in mice. Dentists interviewed by The New York Times said that any visible effects of chewing hard gum would be, at best, minor and temporary.
The more pressing issue might be the product's safety, especially for young people whose jaws are still developing. In a statement, the American Dental Association cautioned that chewing dense gum at length could put people at risk for temporomandibular disorders, which cause pain in the jaw joint and muscles.
Online trends like using gum to shape one's jawline "are rarely backed by scientific evidence and can range from ineffective to harmful when it comes to oral health," the organization added.
Gum companies say that their products are not just safe but beneficial if used for short intervals. Ms. Tran, the Jawliner spokeswoman, said that the brand encouraged customers to "train" every other day for no more than 10 minutes to prevent injury. Tomas Palomaki, the founder of Stronger Gum, said chewing should be kept to under 30 minutes, and encouraged anyone with TMJ disorders to consult a doctor before trying their products.
Some customers are ignoring those warnings. Dr. Dar Radfar, a dentist in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said that in the past two years, more and more of his teenage patients had been chewing hard gum for up to an hour a day.
Now, when young patients comes into his office complaining of jaw pain, Dr. Radfar's first question is whether they are chewing gum or doing related jaw exercises. "They're like, 'Yeah, I want to strengthen my jawline,"' he said. (He urges them to reconsider.)
Beyond the potential physical downsides, these companies are communicating to young people that their jawlines can, and perhaps should, look like those of fully grown men, said Dr. Kavita Mariwalla, a dermatologist in West Islip, N.Y., who published a paper on how social media can affect perception of self.
Social media's effects on young women like the ones flooding Sephora in search of skin care products intended for adults are well documented, Dr. Mariwalla said. She sees less discussion of the pressure for young men to look fully developed at a very young age, which has been accelerated by buff TikTok and Instagram influencers.
In April, her 12-year-old son asked if he could try jawline-shaping gum. She balked; her husband started laughing. "He was like, typical Dad," Dr. Mariwalla said: "'Don't worry, kid, you're going to have a jawline like me."'

For LVMH, a Welcome But Risky Endeavor: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The reaction to the conglomerate's involvement in the Games has been relatively -- and surprisingly -- free of criticism, yet the stakes are high.
Among the dozens of sponsors of this summer's Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris, one will be by far the most visible and influential: LVMH, the French luxury goods conglomerate. The company has invested 150 million euros ( $ 163 million) in the 2024 Olympic Games, a gamble for a brand that has long marketed its goods to the upper echelons of society. And the company isn't just putting its name on the event. It is putting its products ... well, pretty much everywhere.
Louis Vuitton created the trunk that carries the Olympic torch and the medal trays for the victory ceremonies. Various other LVMH companies are involved as well. The jeweler Chaumet designed the medals, all of which will include a piece of wrought iron from the Eiffel Tower. Berluti, together with the French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld, designed the outfits the French team will wear during the opening ceremony. And Louis Vuitton and Sephora are in charge of the Olympic torch relay, which started on May 8 in Marseille and ends on July 26 in Paris, when the Games begin.
"This is the biggest event of our life in terms of commitment," Antoine Arnault, who is in charge of image and environment at LVMH, said at a conference about sports and fashion organized by The New York Times in Paris this month. Mr. Arnault is the chairman of Loro Piana and the oldest son of Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH.
"We decided not just to sign a check," Mr. Arnault said. "We decided that if we were going to do it, it was going to be new. It was going to be something that was never seen before."
But becoming not just a sponsor but what the company calls the "creative partner" in the 2024 Olympics, and turning what is seen as a national showcase into a luxury advertisement, comes with risks.
LVMH will be highly visible during the opening ceremony, a four-and-a-half hour event that will be watched by 1.5 billion people around the world and that Mr. Arnault described as "very visibly LVMH-created." The official Olympic Games website promises that it will be "bold, original and unique."
A lot rests on those four-and-a-half hours, he said, citing potential hiccups beyond his control -- a security incident, a strike or bad weather -- that could derail the ceremony.
"This is a big risk for us," Mr. Arnault said. "It needs to go perfectly for us to feel good about our commitment to these games. If the ceremony fails, it's not going to be a very good night for us."
Looking back at the negotiations leading up to the sponsorship announcement in 2023 and the unique way in which LVMH is putting its stamp on the games, Mr. Arnault said that the decision to participate became "obvious" and that it had been received well internally and externally.
"We were never proactively thinking of being the main sponsor," he said at the Times conference. But after another major sponsor withdrew, "it suddenly became possible" he said, for the company to have a seat at the table and to have real influence on the Games.
"As a sports fan, as an Olympic Games viewer and passionate about this world, I thought it was essential and obvious for us to carry that role as the leading luxury group in France," Mr. Arnault said.
LVMH has strengthened its relationship with the world of sports in other ways in anticipation of the Olympics. This year, for the first time since 2017, Louis Vuitton is sponsoring the America's Cup, the world's most prestigious sailing yacht competition.
Yet as LVMH becomes an increasingly visible part of the French economy and the Parisian streetscape, it has become -- inevitably, it seems -- a target of criticism. In April 2023, for example, demonstrators who were protesting plans to raise France's retirement age, forced their way into the company headquarters on Avenue Montaigne.
LVMH, as well as its chief executive, faced criticism when it promised to invest $ 226 million in the restoration of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame after it was engulfed by flames in 2019. There were people who criticized the wealthy donors for not paying their fair share in taxes, depriving the French government of revenue to repair the cathedral. Others criticized the reputational boost bestowed on philanthropists during a time of tragedy.
"There's always a lot of criticism around anything we do," Mr. Arnault said. "It's almost a part of the French way of life." But, surprisingly, there has been less criticism than might have been expected on the company's involvement in the Olympic Games, he said.
The Olympics, too, are not without criticism, especially from Parisians who are finding their city much harder to live in this summer because of traffic and increased security. Other challenges abound as well. As of June, the Seine remained too dirty for open-water swimming events. Officials said that because of unusually heavy rain, sewage water had ended up in the river.
In a show of discontent, some locals threatened to use the river as a public toilet on the original day that Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, planned to swim in the Seine to prove the water was clean. Protesters used the hashtag #JeChieDansLaSeineLe23Juin, which, though it may sound better in French, urged people to defecate in the river. (The protest did not appear to materialize, but the mayor did take a dip in the Seine this month.)
As LVMH continues to engage in major sporting events, it is not unreasonable to assume that it has its sights on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Mr. Arnault was wary of making any statements before this year's games had even begun.
"For 150 million, let's just make this one work well," he said. "We'll talk about L.A. after."

Once Uncool, a Look Gains a Fresh Sheen: [Style Desk]

Full text: Some South Asian women remember being embarrassed of their families' hair oiling traditions. Now, beauty brands, bloggers and celebrities are embracing them.
Hair oiling days for the comedian and actress Lilly Singh were always a family affair.
The entire Singh clan -- including her cousins, aunties and uncles down the street -- would gather in the living room, each waiting to have their scalps rigorously massaged by her mother or grandmother.
"Yes, it was good for hair," she said in a recent interview. "But it was also just -- for lack of a better word -- a vibe."
The good vibes remained until Ms. Singh started high school, where the shiny, oiled look was seen as decidedly uncool by her peers, a perception that she and her cousins internalized. "I don't think I ever did a slicked-back braid in high school ever -- I'd rather jump off a building," she deadpanned.
It's a familiar childhood story for many women of color, who remember washing their hair before the start of a new week to avoid taunts at school or stares in public.
"My parents are Pakistani, and I've been hair oiling since I had hair," said Kirin Bhatty, a celebrity makeup artist who grew up in Los Angeles. "I hated it as a kid because when you're a kid, you want to be like everyone else, and no one else was hair oiling. I just wanted, at the time, to have an Herbal Essences moment."
Like Ms. Singh, she abandoned her weekly ritual when she went off to college.
But lately, in sharp contrast with the hair hygiene practices of the late 1990s and early 2000s -- when dry shampoo was whipped out at even the slightest sign of grease and near-daily hair washes were de rigueur -- oiled hair has become a distinct part of the "It" girl look.
On TikTok, where the hashtag #hairoiling has garnered almost two billion views, young women post videos of themselves heading to the gym or running errands wearing the kind of greasy ponytails that Ms. Singh would have never left the house in. One influencer, Nicole Mehta, wore an oiled bun to a New York Fashion Week show. Another, Diipa Büller-Khosla, slicked her hair back to walk down the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. In one TikTok video, the influencer and model Valeria Lipovetsky shows her followers how to achieve her "wet hair" look using oils and masks.
"You want the hair looking dirty and greasy and weird," she jokes in the video.
Celebrities like Hailey Bieber, Kim Kardashian and Sofia Richie -- who have powerful sway over larger style trends -- have shared in recent years that they slather their hair with oil, too. And in February, Beyoncé told Essence magazine that the hair oil in her new hair care line, Cécred, was inspired by the oiling practices of her mother, Tina Knowles.
"People are always asking me, like, 'Hey, I saw this on TikTok -- which oil do you think is good for my hair?"' said Xavier Velasquez, a celebrity hair stylist whose clients include Maria Sharapova and Olivia Wilde. "They kind of want an easy way out of having to style their hair in the humidity or after getting out of a pool or at the beach."
The trend is part of a broader shift that some industry experts are calling the "skinification" of hair -- a renewed focus on nourishing one's scalp and hair through multistep routines rather than merely styling it. Sales of scalp care products grew 24 percent in the first quarter compared with the same time last year, according to the market research firm Circana, compared with 9 percent growth in the overall hair segment. And growth in hair oil sales, the firm found, has outpaced the total category by more than 1.5 times so far this year.
Sephora has also seen "a significant shift in consumer preference" toward products that address scalp concerns and hair thinning and a "growing interest" in hair oils, Jennifer Lucchese, the company's vice president for hair care merchandising, said in an email statement.
With skin care, "people started to move away from just color and cosmetics to 'wait, what if my baseline skin was great?"' said Rooshy Roy, the founder and chief executive of Aavrani, an ayurvedic skin care brand that branched out with a hair care line in collaboration with Ms. Singh. "I think that shift is happening with hair care." Aavrani's hair products -- which include an oil and a serum -- quickly sold out after hitting Sephora's Canada website in March.
Consumers are now focused on elevating "that foundational level of hair," Ms. Roy said.
Mentions of oiling the scalp and hair can be found in thousand-year-old ayurvedic texts from the Indian subcontinent, where the term "champi" and its derivatives translates to "massage" and is the origin of the word shampoo.
An Indian entrepreneur, Sake Dean Mahomed, helped spread the practice in the West in 1814, when he opened a bathhouse in Brighton, England, that offered a champi featuring Indian herbs and oils, presenting it as a treatment for all kinds of health concerns. It became so popular among aristocrats that he was appointed the "shampooing surgeon" for King George IV.
Ms. Büller-Khosla, who is also the founder of the skin and hair care brand Indē Wild, based her hair oil on a recipe that her mother brewed at home for decades. It includes castor oil, sesame oil, hibiscus flowers and native Indian herbs. The United States has become the brand's biggest market since it introduced the oil two years ago, she said. (For the record, at 65, her mother, who features prominently in Indē Wild's branding, has a full head of lush hair that reaches down to her ankles.)
Other cultures have long had their own versions of hair oil, too. In Latina communities, scalp care often features ingredients like maracujá (passion fruit) or acai oil. For Black women, moisturizing the scalp with oil is a common part of wash days, said Taylor Anise, who has used social media to document her journey back to wearing her natural hair.
Some people have mixed emotions about the new appreciation for an old, cherished ritual. Tensions came to the fore last year when a rosemary-mint hair oil sold by Mielle Organics, a long-admired and fiercely guarded brand among Black people, became so popular on TikTok after it was shared by a white influencer that it sold out in stores across the country. Some Black women were shocked and felt protective of the product, which was more than just a trend to them.
Similar feelings are bubbling up for some South Asian women lately. The recent boom in hair oil is an example of the "exoticization of our culture," said Priya Satiani, a talent manager in Los Angeles who also remembers hair oiling as a central part of her childhood. "It's a fine line -- on the one hand, it's amazing to be appreciated, but it's also terrible to be appropriated."
Many South Asians are now revisiting the cultural practice. Ms. Satiani said that she started oiling her 9-month-old niece's hair as a way to pass on the tradition. Ms. Bhatty, the celebrity makeup artist, introduced hair oiling to her partner, and they have since turned it into a weekly self-care session.
Ms. Singh said: "This thing that I used to feel really insecure about and that I used to be made fun of is trendy -- does that hurt me a little bit? Yeah, I won't lie."
"Now when I have oil in my hair, people will approach me and be like, 'Your hair looks so good right now,"' she added. "And I'm like, 'Where were you when I was in high school?"'

A 'Bum Bum' Cream Is the Latest Tween Obsession: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A scented lotion by the brand Sol de Janeiro is a hit among adolescents. Cue bafflement and concern from some adults.
One of the most coveted beauty products among teenagers is a creamy, fragrant lotion that comes in a tangerine-colored plastic tub.
Called Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, it is sold for $ 48 by the beauty brand Sol de Janeiro. According to the company's website, the lotion smells like pistachios and "helps visibly smooth and tighten the appearance of your skin."
Many of its fans fall well outside the typical market for firming.
"All of my friends have it," said Leyton Smith, a 15-year-old in Scottsdale, Ariz. He took his mother's jug of the cream, which she had bought for cellulite. "I didn't really realize it was for that purpose," he said.
Despite the "Bum Bum" name, Leyton thinks most people his age are using the product as a scented hand cream. He and his 10-year-old sister now have several different lotions and sprays from the company, all of which come in a rainbow of candy-colored packaging.
"It's just one of those products that, like, all these people were getting them, so you feel like you have to have it too," Leyton said.
The product has been finding young customers on TikTok, where influencers show it off in videos with millions of views, and at stores like Sephora, whose website lists it among recommended gifts for teenagers. According to Sol de Janeiro, a jar of Brazilian Bum Bum Cream is sold every six seconds.
Although the company did not offer an age breakdown of Brazilian Bum Bum Cream buyers, the brand clearly resonates with teenagers. More than 500 reviews of the product on Sol de Janeiro's website were posted by customers identifying themselves as under 18. The brand's perfume mists have also taken off online, helping to make Sol de Janeiro the second-favorite fragrance brand among teenage girls, according to a recent survey by the investment bank Piper Sandler.
"This brand does have a chokehold on these children," said Abby Rivera, a content creator who makes videos about cosmetics and skin care.
The Bum Bum cream has generated debate, and a bit of bafflement, among parents and dermatologists who wonder why a product with a label that claims it "visibly firms & tightens" has taken off among wrinkle-free adolescents.
"Who are you crazy people buying this for a 13 year old?" one commenter asked in a heated discussion about the product on an online message board for parents.
In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Sol de Janeiro said the company's products were intended for all skin types and "designed to cater to the diverse needs of all generations." She added that Brazilian Bum Bum Cream's "visibly firming and tightening" claims did not need to be the focus for young customers.
"While these terms describe the product's benefits, the focus for younger users should be on the hydration and nourishing properties," she said.
The spokeswoman said that the company took parental concerns seriously. "We encourage parents to check the ingredient lists to ensure there are no allergens or sensitivities that might affect their teens," she said.
The product attributes its tightening properties to caffeine-rich guarana, a relatively weak ingredient that is safe for most young people's skin, said Dr. Brooke Jeffy, a dermatologist who founded a tween-focused skin care line that features few ingredients.
Some of Sol de Janeiro's other lotions, like its Bom Dia Bright Body Cream, contain stronger ingredients, including vitamin C and alpha hydroxy acid, that should be avoided on young skin, she added.
But even the brand's milder body creams, including Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, could still be irritating for young customers, who have much more sensitive skin than adults, because of the fragrances they contain, Dr. Jeffy said.
And then there is the product's messaging. "It feeds into this cultural pressure that is starting younger and younger to be worried about aging," Dr. Jeffy said. "Even the whole fact that this is 'Bum Bum' -- we kind of know what that refers to."
In the statement, Sol de Janeiro said its brand mission was to help customers celebrate themselves "regardless of shape, size, race or background." "Our commitment to body celebration across all ages is authentically reflected in our campaigns and social media presence since Day 1," the company said.
The company was founded in 2015 with the goal of developing beauty products that draw on what Heela Yang, Sol de Janeiro's chief executive and one of its founders, has described in interviews as Brazilians' natural sense of body confidence. (Ms. Yang's sister, Hannah, is the chief growth and customer officer of The New York Times.)
"When it came to identifying products, we then asked ourselves what part of the body it seemed that Brazilians were preoccupied with," Ms. Yang said in a 2017 interview with the British beauty publication Get the Gloss. "That didn't take long. The answer was unanimous: the bum bum (pronounced 'boom boom' for all you Brits)."
Sol de Janeiro's website clarifies that the product is not only for the posterior: "Use it on your bum bum, legs, tummy, arms -- anywhere you need a lift for positively glowing skin," the product description reads.
The company was acquired by the French body care retailer L'Occitane in 2021, and its sales are expected to reach $ 1 billion this fiscal year, according to The Business of Fashion. Several Sol de Janeiro products, including Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, are listed as best sellers on Sephora's website.
Sol de Janeiro has built on the cream's popularity by releasing more products with sweet scents and bright, cheerful visual profiles. It sells a dragon-fruit-scented pink tub of "Elasti-Cream" and a suite of pastel fragrance sprays. A new, limited-edition Brazilian Bum Bum Cream comes with a pack of stickers shaped like bananas, coconuts and hot-air balloons.
Rachel Azzolini, 29, who lives in Louisville, Ky., said that the bright packaging and fruity scents were what drew her 5-year-old daughter to Sol de Janeiro's products. She said she was concerned when a Sephora employee gave her daughter a miniature sample of the Sol de Janeiro Elasti-Cream, which says it is "retinol-mimicking" on its packaging.
"I thought, I don't want my 5-year-old using retinol," she said.
Ms. Azzolini allowed her daughter to use the cream once she discovered that it did not actually contain retinol, a vitamin A derivative that can be irritating, especially to younger skin. She tries to avoid harsh ingredients, but otherwise said she was happy to support her daughter's interest in skin care, despite the negative comments she sometimes sees about "Sephora kids" on social media.
"It's not that serious," she said. "They're just trying to have fun."
She recently bought her daughter a travel-size set of Sol de Janeiro creams that includes Brazilian Bum Bum Cream. She said she was not worried about her daughter engaging with the product's language about firming and tightening. "She doesn't even think about that stuff or comprehend that yet," Ms. Azzolini said.
Still, the product appears to fit into a trend of young people fretting about their appearances earlier and earlier, said Charlotte H. Markey, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University and the author of a coming book on adolescents' body image.
"It's kind of this sneaky message about aging," she said. "Even if the girls aren't initially gravitating to the product for anti-aging purposes, they're getting that message on their counter in the bathroom every day."

National Urban League Is Coming Home: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The civil rights organization will anchor a sprawling mixed-use development in Harlem that will include a new museum focused on the American civil rights struggle in the North.
The National Urban League is moving its headquarters to Harlem, the neighborhood where it was founded in 1910, and will open New York City's first museum devoted to the American civil rights movement and one of few in the nation to focus on the struggles in the North.
The organization was founded in 1910 in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood, but its headquarters are currently in Lower Manhattan. With the return to its roots, the National Urban League will put a spotlight on the influence of the Harlem Renaissance on the civil rights movement in its museum, among other exhibitions.
To its president, Marc H. Morial, the move is more than a financial decision; it's an opportunity for the civil rights organization, dedicated to the economic empowerment of urban communities, to practice what it preaches.
"When we began to think about where we wanted to locate and whether we wanted to buy or build, Harlem was always my first choice because it was where we were born," Mr. Morial said. "But also because for an organization that's mission-driven, office space is more than a place to work. It's about being part of a community. It's about having impact. It's about working with partners and others who you are symbiotic with."
The new headquarters will anchor a 17-story mixed-use development called the Urban Empowerment Center, on the 125th Street block flanked by Malcolm X and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards. The organization will use 81,000 square feet of space in the center for its offices and the new Urban Civil Rights Museum on the fourth floor. The museum will have a cafe, a 300-seat auditorium and 12,000 feet of exhibition space. In addition to the Harlem Renaissance, the museum will explore the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Great Migration.
"The National Urban League is unique among civil rights organizations in that it was founded in the North to assist African American migrants who were transitioning from the South to the North to find jobs, housing, dignity and civil and economic power," Mr. Morial said.
The rest of the development's 414,000 square feet is for offices, retail and 171 affordable residential units. The Studio Museum in Harlem, the United Negro College Fund and One Hundred Black Men will have offices in the building, and Virginia Union University will have an administrative center for recruitment, alumni engagement and instructional support services. The retail space is already 95 percent leased, with Target, Sephora and Trader Joe's among the tenants.
Leading the project are Taconic Partners, the Prusik Group, L+M Development Partners and BRP Companies, all experienced developers known for tailoring projects to local communities. Dawanna Williams, founder and managing principal at Dabar Development Partners, who serves as the National Urban League's owner's representative and overall project manager, has also been key to the development's success, Mr. Morial said.
These interviews have been edited for clarity.
Marc H. Morial, president of the National Urban League
We took on a project that many said could not be done and did it on a site where multiple concepts had risen and failed over the last 30 to 40 years. We are investing in the community. This is a $ 250 million project that will create jobs and have impact.
There's multiple layers here. We wanted to make a powerful statement, and we wanted to make it by action. And I wanted to demonstrate that you can build in a community like Harlem a first-class building; attract first-class retail; use a combination of minority developers, contractors and others; partner with first-class retailers and investors; bring together the city and the state as partners; combine retail with affordable housing; and do it with a cultural component as well.
Michael J. Garner, director at One Hundred Black Men
Our mission is education, mentoring, economic development, and health and wellness. Those are our four pillars. The One Hundred Black Men are 175 of the most powerful Black men in this region, including former mayors, sitting U.S. congressmen, city councilmen, business leaders, government officials and educators. We view ourselves as being the solution to the issues that are impacting the Black community here in the city of New York.
Being in a state-of-the-art building on the historic 125th Street corridor gives us the ability to create an innovative corporate chapter for the One Hundred Black Men. But it also gives us the ability to jointly partner with the National Urban League and build off our synergies.
Chris Losco, senior vice president at Taconic Partners
The commitment of the National Urban League really helped this project come to fruition. It wouldn't be possible without them. We are super excited for them to be the anchor and an amazing co-tenant to build around.
125th Street is one of the country's historic cultural and retail corridors. To be a part in hopefully adding to that and enhancing that, not just through these retail and commercial uses, but also through the cultural uses including the civil rights museum and the Studio Museum and the work they're doing to help educate and celebrate the past, present and future of the Black experience in America, is just really cool.
Meredith Marshall, co-founder and managing partner of BRP Companies
It's fortunately a 100 percent low-income building by HUD's own definition. We've partnered with a group called the New York Foundling, focused on helping people who have aged out of foster care find housing. Fifty-one units are leased here for them. This is a group of people who are underserved. They need services and support.
Lisa Gomez, chief executive of L+M Development Partners
We love complicated public-private partnerships. I personally feel like these are the most interesting places to be able to work. This project was like a Jenga puzzle. It's a complicated building because you have to put a lot of different uses together, like leaving stairways and open floor plates for the museum and creating units for housing.
Our company's goal was to activate 125th Street, which, particularly during the pandemic, has lost lots of ground-floor retail. We hope that this project can replace some of the vibrance that was lost or muted during the pandemic.

Young and Fragrant: Teens Pursue Signature Scents: [Style Desk]

Full text: On a recent trip to Sephora, 11-year-old Lincoln Rivera asked his mom for a $ 125 atomizer of Yves Saint Laurent eau de parfum.
He also covets scents from Jean Paul Gaultier, which he learned about from the animated movie "Megamind," and Paco Rabanne (some of its cologne bottles are shaped like robots).
"I feel fine about how I smell," said Lincoln, a fifth grader in Westchester County, N.Y., whose olfactory experimentation has so far been limited to deodorant. "But I could smell even better."
Abby Rivera, Lincoln's mother, first thought the designer scents sounded like overkill for her son to wear to elementary school. She was surprised by his sudden interest until she heard that some of his hockey teammates had also been asking their parents for high-end cologne, too.
"It's like a status thing right now -- they all want it," she said. "Just like the girls want this high-end skin care and body care, this is like the boys' version."
Teenage boys have long turned to mists and sprays to drown out the first whiffs of puberty, but some even younger adolescents -- whose parents have the cash, that is -- are now becoming infatuated by designer colognes with price tags in the hundreds of dollars.
Teen boys' annual spending on fragrance rose 26 percent in the year ending in March, according to a semiannual survey of youth spending patterns by the investment bank Piper Sandler. Axe, Old Spice and Bath & Body Works fell in its rankings of teens boys' favorite fragrance brands, while luxury brands including Valentino and Jean Paul Gaultier climbed.
It's not just about showing off a cologne's high price tag: Young enthusiasts say that cultivating an air of sophistication is what separates the boys from the slightly older boys. Using terminology they absorb online, middle schoolers at sleepovers are discussing high-end fragrances the way that sommeliers might analyze wine.
The scent Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier has "a really good honey note," said Luke Benson, a 14-year-old who lives in Orlando, Fla. Tom Ford Noir Extreme, on the other hand, is "a lot spicier and a little bit darker."
Other young scent aficionados throw around vocabulary like "sillage," a French term for how heavily a fragrance lingers, and dissect the merits and shortcomings of different formulations.
"Too much alcohol smells super strong and burns your nose," said Easton, a 12-year-old in Oklahoma. He and his 10-year-old brother, Bentley, use their father's collection of more than 70 colognes to create "scent of the day" videos for a parent-run account on TikTok.
In one video, Bentley, who is in fourth grade, grips a $ 100 bottle of Invictus Victory Elixir. "This has notes of vanilla, caramel and tonka," he says, referring to a South American legume.
Dollars and Scents
Tween hygiene has become much more elaborate than swiping on deodorant before gym class. Preteen girls have recently made headlines for seeking out high-end skin creams and serums, sometimes with anti-aging ingredients that are intended for adults.
Hannah Glover, a middle-school physical fitness teacher in Bluffton, S.C., has been shocked by how early the cosmetic products of adulthood have been gaining a foothold with her 11-to-15-year-old students. Boys in her class bring bottles of Gucci, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent cologne to school and show them off to their classmates, she said, while girls are obsessed with lip products and Sol De Janeiro moisturizers.
"To give an 11-year-old a $ 160 bottle of cologne or a $ 40 lip gloss, it just blows my mind," Ms. Glover, 27, said. "When I was in middle school, we had Sweet Pea and Cucumber from Bath & Body Works."
Young cologne customers are trying free samples in stores like Macy's, Ulta and Sephora, or siphoning spritzes from parents. Those who can afford it are spending their allowances on cologne or asking for bottles as birthday gifts from relatives.
Logan, a 14-year-old in Chicago, started putting his bar mitzvah money toward a cologne collection about six months ago. The fragrances boost his self-esteem, he said, especially a nearly $ 300 bottle of Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille, which he considers his signature scent. He does not mind "dupes" of designer scents, but he is not exactly drawn to the mass-market brands that have captivated previous generations.
"I don't think I've ever smelled Axe," said Logan, who has a swoop of brown hair and braces.
Logan's mother, Jamie, is impressed by her son's depth of knowledge. "But we also talk about how things can get out of hand, and that we have limited funds and we can't every week get a new one," she said.

The fragrance category, which pulled in about $ 70 billion in sales in 2022, according to a McKinsey report, is full of designer as well as "niche" brands competing for the nostrils of ever-younger customers. While men once stuck to a preferred fragrance for years or even decades, Gen Z customers are more likely to shop around, said Korinne Wolfmeyer, a senior research analyst for Piper Sandler and an author of its teen spending report.
That may make brands even more eager to get on the radar of potential customers as soon as possible. "If that brand can get in early, even develop a little bit of loyalty, it's easier for them than if they were trying to capture that consumer when they are maybe 20 years old," Ms. Wolfmeyer said.
Men's fragrance was a relatively unshowy hygienic product until the 1970s, when Paco Rabanne's Pour Homme helped reframe cologne as a fashion statement, said Paul Austin, the founder of a fragrance and branding agency, Austin Advisory Group. The trendy colognes that followed -- Davidoff Cool Water and Drakkar Noir in the 1980s, Acqua di Gio and CK One in the 1990s -- were still mostly targeted toward customers in their 20s and 30s, Mr. Austin said.
The introduction of Axe body spray in 2002 brought even younger customers into the category, and soon teenagers were spritzing themselves with products from Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret, and a particularly potent scent from Abercrombie & Fitch.
"What were seeing now is, I'm sure, in part formed by what Axe did to open up the door," Mr. Austin said.
Now, teenage shoppers seem to be developing more expensive taste. At Sephora and Ulta, high-end fragrances are swelling in popularity among young shoppers, according to executives for both companies. Quincy Dickerson, the fragrance department manager at Nordstrom in Manhattan, said she had never seen so many prepubescent boys swarm the designer fragrance display before this year.
Ms. Dickerson said she has had to replace the tester bottle of Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male Elixir ( $ 152) several times because groups of tweens keep stealing it.
"Even though it smells like grandpa, they're coming in to get it because of TikTok," Ms. Dickerson said.
'Smellmaxxing'
Asked why middle schoolers have suddenly developed a nose for Dior, almost every teenager, researcher and merchandising expert offered the same answer: TikTok. On the platform, influencers offer tips for "smellmaxxing," or improving one's musk, and recommend scents for working out, date night and middle school.
"Social media and TikTok make people want to be more grown-up," said Luke, the 14-year-old.
Young shoppers are taking cues from influencers like Jeremy Fragrance, a buff German man with 8.8 million followers on the platform. Usually wearing an all-white outfit and a Rolex, he shows off his Ferrari and sniffs his fans to guess which scents they are wearing. "Bleu de Chanel, obviously," he tells one.
Other fragrance influencers are teenagers themselves. Tristan Rodriguez, a 15-year-old in Litchfield Park, Ariz., recommends citrus scents when his followers have math tests, and peppery scents when they have dates. He was inspired to get into cologne by Jeremy Fragrance, he said in an interview, and is now known for posting over-the-top, sometimes emotional responses to certain scents.
"It's lavender, fresh, comforter, bedsheets," he says in one video, taking a drag of Nuits de Noho by Bond No. 9 ( $ 420 for just over three ounces). "Wow, this going to be good for the ladies, for sure."
Jatin Arora, a high school senior in Winnipeg, Canada, shares daily reviews with more than a million followers on his TikTok account, TheCologneBoy. In an interview, Mr. Arora, 18, said he had been interested in colognes since childhood because he saw adults wearing them. He shoots the videos in his bedroom, in front of a wall of nearly 400 bottles of cologne, many of which have been provided to him by brands at no cost.
He sometimes feels conflicted about how many young people make purchases (or ask their parents to) based on his recommendations. "I mean, I'm a kid, I'm still learning," he said. "But whatever knowledge I have, I try my best to help them."
Some parents and teachers wonder about the appropriateness of these products for a young audience. Teenagers are especially fond of the packaging of Angels' Share by Kilian, which resembles a glass of cognac, and Le Male, a strapping torso with wide shoulders and a bulging crotch. "They make it so sexy," said Ms. Glover, the middle school teacher, "and an 11-year-old is like, I want to wear that to school."
Those concerns do not seem to be shared by teenagers, who see the colognes as a way to exude maturity, status or anything other than B.O.
Matt Martocci, who lives in Parsippany, N.J., asked for a bottle of Dior Sauvage as a Christmas present when he was 12. Now 15, he shares spritzes of the niche cologne Xerjoff Erba Gold with his friends. ("The top note of that is very peachy.")
"If you smell really good or if you smell really bad, it can make or break a situation," Matt said. What kind of situation? "Like, talking to a girl, or something."
Matt even picks out perfumes for his mother, Lora, who appreciates that the hobby helps her son feel put together. She is willing to contribute -- within reason. "He'll ask for things for Christmas, and I'll be like, 'Matt, that's a little bit on the high end,"' she said. "Could we do a little bit more chores around the house?"

On a recent trip to Sephora, 11-year-old Lincoln Rivera asked his mother for a $125 atomizer of Yves Saint Laurent eau de parfum.
He also covets scents from Jean Paul Gaultier, which he learned about from the animated movie “Megamind,” and Paco Rabanne (some of its cologne bottles are shaped like robots).
“I feel fine about how I smell,” said Lincoln, a fifth grader in Westchester County, New York, whose olfactory experimentation has so far been limited to deodorant. “But I could smell even better.”
Abby Rivera, Lincoln’s mother, first thought the designer scents seemed like overkill for her son to wear to elementary school. She was surprised by his sudden interest until she heard that some of his hockey teammates had also been asking their parents for high-end cologne, too.
“It’s like a status thing right now — they all want it,” she said. “Just like the girls want this high-end skin care and body care, this is like the boys’ version.”
Teenage boys have long turned to mists and sprays to drown out the first whiffs of puberty, but some even younger adolescents — whose parents have the cash, that is — are now becoming infatuated by designer colognes with price tags in the hundreds of dollars.
Teenage boys’ annual spending on fragrances rose 26% in the year ending in March, according to a semiannual survey of youth spending patterns by the investment bank Piper Sandler. Axe, Old Spice and Bath & Body Works fell in the bank’s rankings of teenage boys’ favorite fragrance brands, while luxury brands, including Valentino and Jean Paul Gaultier, rose.
It’s not just about showing off a cologne’s high price tag: Young enthusiasts say that cultivating an air of sophistication is what separates the boys from the slightly older boys. Using terminology they absorb online, middle schoolers at sleepovers are discussing high-end fragrances the way that sommeliers might analyze wine.
The scent Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier has “a really good honey note,” said Luke Benson, a 14-year-old who lives in Orlando, Florida. Tom Ford Noir Extreme, on the other hand, is “a lot spicier and a little bit darker.”
Other young scent aficionados throw around vocabulary like “sillage,” a French term for how heavily a fragrance lingers, and dissect the merits and shortcomings of different formulations.
“Too much alcohol smells super strong and burns your nose,” said Easton, a 12-year-old in Oklahoma. He and his 10-year-old brother, Bentley, use their father’s collection of more than 70 colognes to create “scent of the day” videos for a parent-run account on TikTok.
In one video, Bentley, who is in fourth grade, grips a $100 bottle of Invictus Victory Elixir. “This has notes of vanilla, caramel and tonka,” he says, referring to a South American legume.
Developing Younger Customers
Tween hygiene has become much more elaborate than swiping on deodorant before gym class. Preteen girls have recently made headlines for seeking out high-end skin creams and serums, sometimes with anti-aging ingredients that are intended for adults.
Hannah Glover, a middle-school physical fitness teacher in Bluffton, South Carolina, has been shocked by how early the cosmetic products of adulthood have been gaining a foothold with her 11- to 15-year-old students. Boys in her class bring bottles of Gucci, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent cologne to school and show them off to their classmates, she said, while girls are obsessed with lip products and Sol De Janeiro moisturizers.
“To give an 11-year-old a $160 bottle of cologne or a $40 lip gloss, it just blows my mind,” Glover, 27, said. “When I was in middle school, we had Sweet Pea and Cucumber from Bath & Body Works.”
Young cologne customers are trying free samples in stores like Macy’s, Ulta and Sephora, or siphoning spritzes from parents. Those who can afford it are spending their allowances on cologne or asking for bottles as birthday gifts from relatives.
Logan, a 14-year-old in Chicago, started putting his bar mitzvah money toward a cologne collection about six months ago. The fragrances boost his self-esteem, he said, especially a nearly $300 bottle of Tom Ford’s Tobacco Vanille, which he considers his signature scent. He does not mind “dupes” of designer scents, but he is not exactly drawn to the mass-market brands that have captivated previous generations.
“I don’t think I’ve ever smelled Axe,” said Logan, who has a swoop of brown hair and braces.
Logan’s mother, Jamie, is impressed by her son’s depth of knowledge. “But we also talk about how things can get out of hand, and that we have limited funds and we can’t every week get a new one,” she said.
The fragrance category, which pulled in about $70 billion in sales in 2022, according to a McKinsey report, is full of designer as well as “niche” brands competing for the nostrils of ever-younger customers. While men once stuck to a preferred fragrance for years or even decades, Gen Z customers are more likely to shop around, said Korinne Wolfmeyer, a senior research analyst for Piper Sandler and an author of its teen spending report.
That may make brands even more eager to get on the radar of potential customers as soon as possible. “If that brand can get in early, even develop a little bit of loyalty, it’s easier for them than if they were trying to capture that consumer when they are maybe 20 years old,” Wolfmeyer said.
Men’s fragrance was a relatively unshowy hygienic product until the 1970s, when Paco Rabanne’s Pour Homme helped reframe cologne as a fashion statement, said Paul Austin, the founder of a fragrance and branding agency, Austin Advisory Group. The trendy colognes that followed — Davidoff Cool Water and Drakkar Noir in the 1980s, Acqua di Gio and CK One in the 1990s — were still mostly targeted toward customers in their 20s and 30s, Austin said.
The introduction of Axe body spray in 2002 brought even younger customers into the category, and soon teenagers were spritzing themselves with products from Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret, and a particularly potent scent from Abercrombie & Fitch.
“What we’re seeing now is, I’m sure, in part formed by what Axe did to open up the door,” Austin said.
Now, teenage shoppers seem to be developing more expensive tastes. At Sephora and Ulta, high-end fragrances are swelling in popularity among young shoppers, according to executives for both companies. Quincy Dickerson, the fragrance department manager at Nordstrom in Manhattan, said she had never seen so many prepubescent boys swarm the designer fragrance display before this year.
Dickerson said she had often needed to replace the tester bottle of Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male Elixir ($152) several times because groups of tweens kept stealing it.
“Even though it smells like grandpa, they’re coming in to get it because of TikTok,” Dickerson said.
‘Smellmaxxing’
Asked why middle schoolers have suddenly developed a nose for Dior, almost every teenager, researcher and merchandising expert offered the same answer: TikTok. On the platform, influencers offer tips for “smellmaxxing,” or improving one’s musk, and recommend scents for working out, date night and middle school.
“Social media and TikTok make people want to be more grown-up,” said Luke, the 14-year-old.
Young shoppers are taking cues from influencers like Jeremy Fragrance, a buff German man with 8.8 million followers on the platform. Usually wearing an all-white outfit and a Rolex, he shows off his Ferrari and sniffs his fans to guess which scents they are wearing. “Bleu de Chanel, obviously,” he tells one.
Other fragrance influencers are teenagers themselves. Tristan Rodriguez, a 15-year-old in Litchfield Park, Arizona, recommends citrus scents when his followers have math tests, and peppery scents when they have dates. He was inspired to get into cologne by Jeremy Fragrance, he said in an interview, and is now known for posting over-the-top, sometimes emotional responses to certain scents.
“It’s lavender, fresh, comforter, bedsheets,” he says in one video, taking a sniff of Nuits de Noho by Bond No. 9 ($420 for just over 3 ounces). “Wow, this going to be good for the ladies, for sure.”
Jatin Arora, a high school senior in Winnipeg, Canada, shares daily reviews with more than 1 million followers on his TikTok account, TheCologneBoy. Arora, 18, said he had been interested in colognes since childhood because he noticed adults wearing them. He shoots the videos in his bedroom, in front of a wall of nearly 400 bottles of cologne, many of which have been provided to him by brands at no cost.
He sometimes feels conflicted about how many young people make purchases (or ask their parents to) based on his recommendations. “I mean, I’m a kid; I’m still learning,” he said. “But whatever knowledge I have, I try my best to help them.”
Some parents and teachers wonder about the appropriateness of these products for a young audience. Teenagers are especially fond of the packaging of Angels’ Share by Kilian, which resembles a glass of cognac, and Le Male, a strapping torso with wide shoulders and a bulging crotch. “They make it so sexy,” said Glover, the teacher, “and an 11-year-old is like, I want to wear that to school.”
Those concerns do not seem to be shared by teenagers, who see the colognes as a way to exude maturity, status or anything other than BO.
Matt Martocci, who lives in Parsippany, New Jersey, asked for a bottle of Dior Sauvage as a Christmas present when he was 12. Now 15, he shares spritzes of the niche cologne Xerjoff Erba Gold with his friends. (“The top note of that is very peachy.”)
“If you smell really good or if you smell really bad, it can make or break a situation,” Matt said. What kind of situation? “Like, talking to a girl, or something.”
Matt even picks out perfumes for his mother, Lora, who appreciates that the hobby helps her son feel put together. She is willing to contribute — within reason. “He’ll ask for things for Christmas, and I’ll be like, ‘Matt, that’s a little bit on the high end,’” she said. “Could we do a little bit more chores around the house?”

Full text: fĭjĭ-tl
A term that has taken off in the retail world to describe the seamless integration of brick-and-mortar and digital experiences for customers.
Kenergy, zillennials, situationships. Americans love portmanteaus. Which helps explain why in the retail world, "phygital" has emerged as a buzzy alternative to "omnichannel" to describe the need for companies to excel at selling things both in stores and online.
Some experts say phygital ("physical" + "digital") does a better job of describing how online and brick-and-mortar shops should work together to create a seamless customer experience. That became a necessity during the pandemic, when things like QR codes, digital payment options and contactless order pickups helped ease people's fears about contracting the virus. Plus, proponents of the term say it captures how retailers are incorporating artificial intelligence and augmented reality.
Barry Collier, an entrepreneur who helped develop Neopets, a game that involves owning virtual pets, has been keeping an eye on the term. He points to IKEA's mobile app, which allows people to virtually sample couches and curtains in their own homes before making a purchase, as an example of phygital innovation. Similarly, Sephora's technology lets shoppers in its stores see what a certain eyeliner or blush might look like without the need to physically apply it to their faces.
The term has made its way into the nonprofit world, too. In a report this month, the World Economic Forum, the independent organization that aims to improve large-scale global problems, wrote, "In the context of developing economies, where infrastructure gaps and digital divides pose significant challenges, the adoption of phygital solutions can foster inclusive development and ensure progress." The organization cited "smart agriculture" -- which uses robotics, drones and A.I. -- as an example.
Momentum Worldwide, a global marketing firm based in New York that describes itself as an experiential agency, takes credit for coining "phygital" in 2007, though it didn't really take off. At the time, it wasn't clear how important online shopping would become. That changed as technology improved, Mr. Collier said.
Some people are more skeptical of the term. John Long, a consultant at Korn Ferry who works with retail clients, thinks "phygital" is redundant with omnichannel -- and is not as easy to say.
"It's an attempt to refresh a word that we've heard a lot," he said. He also questioned whether phygital passes the litmus test for a valuable new word: "Is it truly helping you articulate something that you otherwise couldn't?" he said.
And there's still some ambiguity about what the term actually conveys.
"I do see it being used more, but I think that there's still a lot of confusion around it," Mr. Collier said, adding, "The implementation will continue to evolve, but what it means I think will eventually settle."

Hiding, Perhaps, Behind a Skin Care Regimen: [Style Desk]

Full text: A young woman asked TikTok whether the man she was dating might be seeing someone else, based on the items in his bathroom. The replies were unequivocal.
"Is he clean, or does he have a girlfriend?"
That's the question Lizzie Kane asked herself while on a fourth date at the home of a man she was seeing.
After finishing a filet mignon dinner he had prepared, she excused herself to his bathroom, where she was met with a mix of niche, luxury skin care brands sitting on his counter and hanging on his shower rail -- the kind of products, she believed, that would be unusual for a straight man to have. At least, not without the help of a woman.
Bewildered, she captured the scene on video before confronting him.
"I don't even have that nice of products -- I use Trader Joe's skin care, to be honest," Ms. Kane, 24, said in a phone interview. "I was like: 'You have some really nice stuff in here. Do you have a girlfriend or something?"'
He insisted that he didn't and said that his dermatologist sister had recommended the brands. "Afterward, when I confronted him, he did show me his whole Instacart order, so he ordered every single one of those things himself," she said.
When Ms. Kane shared the video on TikTok, where it has now been viewed nearly seven million times, it spurred a debate about whether the man had a girlfriend. (The answer, according to the internet, was a resounding yes.)
Although she didn't think his beauty products were a huge red flag, they were certainly a factor in Ms. Kane's decision to stop dating him soon after.
Despite stereotypes that straight men will always go for the four-in-one cleanser, own exactly one towel and perhaps use body lotion as face cream, it's totally acceptable -- and increasingly common -- for straight men to pay closer attention to their self-care, especially when skin care education is more accessible now than ever.
However, what is striking about the array of products Ms. Kane encountered is the selection: Ouai hair care, Tatcha cleanser, Paula's Choice toners and Goop face oil -- brands typically favored by women. It would be natural to assume that the source of his specific taste was a woman who knows her way around the aisles of Sephora or Ulta.
"It's not because I don't believe that guys can have good self-care -- I absolutely believe that -- but it gets to a certain point where it's a little skeptical," she said. "I mean, people pointed out in the video the bedazzled Charlotte Tilbury."
Among a flurry of responses from users on TikTok and X, some jokingly called on her to "get out of THAT WOMAN'S HOME IMMEDIATELY." Others pointed to the lavender-colored storage container as a clear sign that it was styled by a woman.
"Yeah, there's no universe in which a man who wears Dior Sauvage also buys Caudalie and Ouai," one user on TikTok wrote.
Others defended him, adding that he might have had an ex-girlfriend help him or wanted to make his bathroom comfortable for his dates. In a review of the comments on video, it seems as if the Charlotte Tilbury product confused viewers the most.
"After six-point-something million views, I would assume that the girlfriend would have seen it, so I really, truly don't believe that there is a girlfriend. I do think that he's a Patrick Bateman, if you will," Ms. Kane said, referring to Christian Bale's character from the film "American Psycho," who paid special attention to his skin care when it came to his morning routine.
Ronald Gathers, 35, watched Ms. Kane's video, and, as a straight man who has a robust skin care routine of his own, said he felt that the bathroom in question maybe had "too much" of a woman's touch.
"You walk into my apartment and you'll see a range of Paula's, you'll see some Farmacy, you'll see a bunch of Korean skin care products," he said. "But all that he had in the shower, it was giving hotel, just grab what you need. It was weird."
Mr. Gathers, who is a technical product manager and bartender living in Bushwick, Brooklyn, said women he dated in the past had raised questions about some of the beauty items he owns, but it never veered into skepticism. According to him, his apartment, including his bathroom, still gives the impression that only a man lives there.
"You come to my house and you're like, 'He's definitely a guy, but maybe he's, like, ran-through, maybe he slept with a few aestheticians and he knows stuff about skin care,"' he said. "Everything I know about self-care has come from women."
As someone who is "transparent to a fault," Mr. Gathers said this was a conversation he could comfortably have on a first date, leaving as little room for suspicion as possible instead of being mysterious or evasive.
"If you're sharing who you are or what you're into," he said, "then I think you have less of a chance of making a woman suspect that you have a girlfriend."

Beauty Stores Like Sephora Attract a Younger Generation of Shoppers Enticed by Social Media: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Sephora has emerged as a retailer of choice among teenagers and preadolescents. Its new chief executive sees both a challenge and an opportunity.
Impelled in large part by TikTok to seek beauty products meant for adults, younger customers -- teenagers and even preadolescents -- are proving to be a mixed blessing for retailers like Sephora and Ulta.
Retail analysts say that as the beauty stores attract a new generation of shoppers, they will need to make sure that the experience remains fulfilling for their older, core customers -- including some who may not enjoy stores full of tweens and teens.
"So much of luxury and prestige is the experience," said Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. "Making an adult feel special is very different than making a college student feel special, which is dramatically different than making a tween feel special. Making sure it speaks to all generations is important."
Teenagers in the United States have said Sephora is their favorite beauty retailer, surpassing Ulta, according to a survey released in October by the investment bank Piper Sandler. The survey found that teenage respondents spent 23 percent more on cosmetics, skin care and fragrance in 2023 than the year before.
Teens and tweens, particularly girls, have always experimented with and spent money on skin care and makeup. But this recent shift from drugstore mascara and blush to the high-end serums and lotions that Sephora carries and are documented on TikTok is leading to younger and younger customers wanting to buy these expensive products once they see that their friends are doing the same.
But some dermatologists are questioning whether all the skin care and makeup products young customers are scooping up at retailers like Sephora are necessary. They say that skin is sensitive at that age, and that too many products can cause irritation. Ingredients like retinol or skin care routines that involve multiple steps may not be suitable for people in their teens, they note.
In recent months, social media has been abuzz with accounts of jubilant, and sometimes rowdy, groups of middle school-aged shoppers buying expensive serums and moisturizers.
While shopping at a Sephora in Las Vegas this year, an eighth grader recounted her skin care routine, which included a pricey cream from Drunk Elephant and a watermelon-scented toner from Glow Recipe containing chemical exfoliants called polyhydroxy acids, or PHAs. The girl said that she did not know what those ingredients did but that the product "smells really nice." She asked her parents to buy the toner for her after seeing it on social media.
Artemis Patrick, who will take over as chief executive of Sephora North America on April 1, said the interest from younger customers was both an opportunity and a challenge.
"I think that we at Sephora have a huge responsibility to make sure -- as do our brands -- to make sure that we educate this future consumer on what's right for them," she told a group of reporters this week.
Sephora trains its store workers on how to advise shoppers, Ms. Patrick said, adding, "They do their very best to make sure that the new consumer knows this is right for your skin."
Ulta has also had younger shoppers flood their stores. The company has added displays and educational guidance, which include dermatologist recommendations, in the store and online, it said.
"While we love seeing teens and tweens embrace skin care and establish healthy beauty rituals early on, we want them to engage with the category responsibly and have access to information on the best solutions for their skin care needs," an Ulta representative said in a statement.
Ms. Patrick takes over Sephora, which is owned by LVMH, as the company is not only experiencing an influx of younger shoppers but also expanding its footprint in suburban areas. Ms. Patrick, 52, is currently president of Sephora's North American region and has worked at the retailer for 18 years.
Since early in the pandemic, when people increased their spending on makeup and skin care, Sephora has maintained double-digit growth in its e-commerce business, Ms. Patrick said. Traffic in its retail stores has also increased, which she attributed to TikTok and the company's advertising.
Over the past three years, the beauty retailer has made a push to expand beyond its urban footprint when it partnered with the department-store chain Kohl's, where it now has small-format shops in about 910 locations.
By next year, Kohl's said it would have Sephora shops in all of its locations. On Tuesday, the department-store chain said Sephora sales at Kohl's stores generated more than $ 1.4 billion in revenue in 2023.
Despite the outsize attention Generation Z is receiving, Ms. Patrick said, younger people's intrigue with beauty is nothing new: While studying abroad in the early 1990s, she asked a friend to bring her lipsticks from MAC Cosmetics in the United States.
Similarly, she said, her 13-year-old daughter -- like many of her peers -- is interested in skin care, carrying products like Supergoop sunscreen in her backpack.
"It's always existed -- this sort of youth obsession with your mom or your caretakers' beauty products," Ms. Patrick said. "The reality is they know what they know, and they know what they want."

Amid debate in Washington over whether TikTok should be banned if its Chinese owner doesn't sell it, one group is watching with particular interest: the many brands -- particularly in the beauty, skin care, fashion, and health and wellness industries -- that have used the video app to boost their sales.
Youthforia, a makeup brand with more than 185,000 followers on TikTok, is thinking about moving more marketing to other platforms, like YouTube and Instagram. Underlining, which makes the popular brand Nailboo, planned to use TikTok to launch a product with a major retailer in August and is now wondering if it will have to change course. And BeautyStat, which sells skin care products on TikTok Shop, can't even fathom the idea of the platform's disappearing.
TikTok is "just too big, especially in beauty and in certain industries, I feel, for it to disappear," said Yaso Murray, BeautyStat's chief marketing officer.
Companies and creators have known for years that TikTok could be at risk. But those fears seem more real now that the House has passed a bill that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its owner, ByteDance, sold it. (Since that vote last week, the bill's progress has slowed in the Senate.)
Some lawmakers in Washington think TikTok is a platform for spying by the Chinese government. Parents fume that it is rotting their children's brains. But lots of companies -- big and small -- credit TikTok and its band of influencers for getting their products in front of potential customers, especially young ones.
Retailers, whether Sephora, Walmart, Target or Amazon, have also been big beneficiaries of TikTok, said Razvan Romanescu, chief executive and co-founder of Underlining and 10PM Curfew, a firm that connects content creators with brands.
"If something goes viral on TikTok, they sell out," Mr. Romanescu said. "So I feel like the whole ecosystem is driven by the discoverability that TikTok provided."
For some brands, TikTok has become an integral piece of marketing strategy and sales growth. That's partly because the short videos are easily digestible by consumers and partly because marketing on the platform is relatively inexpensive for smaller brands. TikTok Shop, which started last year and allows shoppers to buy products directly on the app, has become particularly popular among beauty and fashion brands.
"Pre-Covid, the beauty category was pretty flat, maybe growing a couple of percentage points each year," said Anna Mayo, a vice president of beauty and personal care at NIQ, a research firm. But during the pandemic, when consumers had more time on their hands and Zoom calls became more popular, TikTok beauty and skin care videos exploded.
"Since then, the beauty industry has been all about growth and hasn't slowed down," Ms. Mayo said. "TikTok is a big driver of that growth."
New products or clothing can be highlighted by individuals who, unlike movie stars or models, feel more relatable to viewers. The quick how-to videos can show the best way to mix and match spring sweaters and jeans or the order in which to apply toner, serums, moisturizers and sunscreen in a morning skin care routine. Some people say they go to TikTok before Google for shopping.
"The first video was a makeup tutorial, showing you how to flawlessly cover acne using three products," said Mikayla Nogueira, a 25-year-old influencer who started making TikTok videos four years ago. "In just 60 seconds, you learned a new skill."
That was when Ms. Nogueira had time on her hands after her university shut down classes and Ulta Beauty, where she worked, closed its stores because of the pandemic. Today, she has 15.5 million followers on TikTok and works regularly with beauty and skin care brands.
While larger companies can spend marketing dollars across a variety of sites, TikTok offers a more affordable advertising channel than platforms like Google and Meta, which owns Instagram.
"For a direct-to-consumer business like ours, the platform is very unique," said Nadya Okamoto, who started posting TikTok videos about the organic menstrual products of her company, August, in the summer of 2021.
First, TikTok's "For You" feed is constantly putting August's videos in front of new consumers, not ones who have chosen to follow the brand on other social media platforms like Instagram. Second, the platform allows Ms. Okamoto to be an in-house chief content creator.
"Other brands are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars each month on advertising, and we're spending next to nothing," she said.
Asked about a possible TikTok ban, Fiona Co Chan, the chief executive and a co-founder of Youthforia, said, "I don't know that anything would fill the hole the same way."
TikTok allows Frida to talk about its baby and postpartum products in a way that other advertising and social media platforms may see as taboo, said Chelsea Hirschhorn, the company's founder. The brand was a relative latecomer as an active user of the app -- ramping up its posts starting about a year ago -- but has about 123,000 followers and has had several videos go viral.
Still, Ms. Hirschhorn said, there are legitimate concerns about TikTok's going away or changing in some way, and Frida isn't overly reliant on the app. It has figured out how to advertise both in traditional forums (it's now sold in 4,000 Walmart stores in the United States) and in more creative ways (sponsoring Jason Kelce's pregnant wife, Kylie, at the Super Bowl when his Philadelphia Eagles played in the game last year).
"I think it's really important that brands have a bulletproof, robust marketing plan in a variety of media channels, both traditional and emerging, in order to weather any prospective challenge," Ms. Hirschhorn said.
While some companies work on contingency plans for new products, others are watching and hoping legislators won't ban the platform.
At BeautyStat, Ms. Murray said she was "trying not to get too alarmed by everything that's going on because I think a lot of brands would suddenly experience a big hole in their sales." She added, "It would be very damaging."

Public Housing Helps Paris Stay Paris: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: One quarter of residents in the French capital live in government-owned housing, part of an aggressive plan to keep lower-income Parisians -- and their businesses -- in the city.
The two-bedroom penthouse comes with sweeping views of the Eiffel Tower and just about every other monument across the Paris skyline. The rent, at 600 euros a month, is a steal.
Marine Vallery-Radot, 51, the apartment's tenant, said she cried when she got the call last summer that hers was among 253 lower-income families chosen for a spot in the l'Îlot Saint-Germain, a new public-housing complex a short walk from the Musée d'Orsay, the National Assembly and Napoleon's tomb.
"We were very lucky to get this place," said Ms. Vallery-Radot, a single mother who lives here with her 12-year-old son, as she gazed out of bedroom windows overlooking the Latin Quarter. "This is what I see when I wake up."
Public housing can conjure images of bleak, boxy towers on the outskirts of a city, but this logement social was built in the former offices of the French Defense Ministry, in the Seventh arrondissement, one of Paris's most chic neighborhoods. It's part of an ambitious and aggressive effort to keep middle- and lower-income residents and small-business owners in the heart of a city that would otherwise be unaffordable to them -- and by extension, to preserve the ineffable character of a city adored by people around the globe.
This summer, when the French capital welcomes upward of 15 million visitors for the Olympic Games, it will showcase a city engineered by government policies to achieve mixité sociale -- residents from a broad cross-section of society. One quarter of all Paris residents now live in public housing, up from 13 percent in the late 1990s. The mixité sociale policy, promoted most forcefully by left-wing political parties, notably the French Communist Party, targets the economic segregation seen in many world cities.
"Our guiding philosophy is that those who produce the riches of the city must have the right to live in it," said Ian Brossat, a communist senator who served for a decade as City Hall's head of housing. Teachers, sanitation workers, nurses, college students, bakers and butchers are among those who benefit from the program.
Making the philosophy a reality is increasingly hard -- the wait list for public housing in Paris is more than six years long. "I won't say this is easy and that we have solved the problem," Mr. Brossat said.
Paris is being buffeted by the same market forces vexing other so-called superstar cities like London, San Francisco and New York -- a sanctum for the world's wealthiest to park their money and buy a piece of a living museum. The average price for a 1,000-square-foot apartment in the center of the capital today is 1.3 million euros (about $ 1.41 million), according to the Chamber of Notaries of Paris.
The Fondation Abbé Pierre, an influential charity, was unusually emphatic in its annual report, published in February, calling France's affordability crisis a "social bomb," with rising homelessness and 2.4 million families waiting on public-housing applications, up from 2 million in 2017. Still, the measures that Paris has taken to keep lower-income residents in the city go far beyond the initiatives in most other European cities, not to mention American ones.
Every Thursday, Jacques Baudrier, the Paris city councilor in charge of housing, scrolls through the list of properties being exchanged by sellers and buyers on the private market. With some exceptions, the city has the legal right to pre-empt the sale of a building, buy the property and convert it to public housing.
"We are in a constant battle," said Mr. Baudrier, who wields a 625 million euro annual budget.
The fight, he said, is against forces that make buying Parisian real estate impossible for all but the well-to-do, including buyers who snap up apartments as pieds-à-terre and then leave them empty for most of the year. Paris has also sharply restricted short-term rentals, after officials became alarmed when historic neighborhoods, including the old Jewish quarter, the Marais, appeared to be shedding full-time residents as investors bought places to rent out to tourists.
At the same time, the city has built or renovated more than 82,000 apartments over the past three decades for families with children. Rents range from six to 13 euros per square meter, depending on household income, meaning that a two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot apartment might go for as little as 600 euros ( $ 650) a month. It has also built 14,000 student apartments over the past 25 years; monthly rents at one complex currently nearing completion in the 13th arrondissement start at 250 euros a month.
For City Hall, social engineering also means protecting the petits commerces, the small shops that contribute to the city's sense of timelessness. When visitors here meander through what seems like a series of small villages, with boulangeries, cheese shops, cobblers and mom-and-pop hardware stores, it is not entirely organic.
City Hall has a direct hand in the types of businesses that take root and survive in Paris because it is the landlord, through its real estate subsidiaries, of 19 percent of the city's shops. Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj, the city counselor who oversees the city's commercial landholdings, said his office is constantly studying neighborhoods to maintain a balance of essential shops and limit the number of chains, which can usually pay higher rent.
"We don't rent to McDonald's, we don't rent to Burger King and we don't rent to Sephora," said Mr. Bonnet-Oulaldj. He acknowledged that in some neighborhoods where private landlords have rented to chains the battle has been plainly lost.
The city is deliberate in what shops it chooses. In an area that had become thick with hairdressing salons, City Hall rented to a boulangerie and a cheese shop. In other neighborhoods it has chosen to rent to bicycle repair shops, in part to reinforce the city's push to reduce the number of cars in favor of bikes. It doesn't rent to massage parlors on the grounds that they are sometimes fronts for prostitution.
A few minutes from the Place de la Bastille is one of the beneficiaries of the city's retail policies. Emmanuelle Fayat, a luthier who restores and services violins for orchestra musicians, sits surrounded by maple and spruce and the tools of her trade: neatly organized rasps, planes and chisels. She rents her shop for "a modest amount" from a city-owned real estate management company.
"I have no knowledge of marketing and I've never asked myself how to become rich," Ms. Fayat said on a recent afternoon. "I just want to do my job. I like my profession more than money."
About a mile away, in a neighborhood rich with cafes and restaurants, Librairie Violette and Co, a feminist and lesbian bookshop, is another beneficiary of Paris's retail diversity program. When the bookshop's previous location was bought by an insurance company and the original owners retired, a group of women that wanted to keep the business going struggled to find a new home and announced they were closing the store.
City officials reached out and offered a new space at below-market rates. "Banks refused to lend us money," said Loïse Tachon, a co-manager of the shop. "They didn't think it would be lucrative enough."
Further north, near the Buttes-Chaumont park, the city rents a storefront to Desirée Fleurs, which specializes in flowers grown in the Paris region. Audrey Venant, the co-founder of the shop, sees the program as a necessary and protective guiding hand.
"Local businesses are very, very fragile," she said, surrounded by narcissus, ranunculus, snapdragon, all perfumed by eucalyptus. "I see a lot of bankruptcies."
Ms. Venant and her husband, a painter and sculptor, live in a 750-square-foot loft that is also part of the city's public-housing program. Her monthly 1,300-euro rent is well below market rates, she said.
The French statistics agency, Insee, reports that Paris is home to more than 10,000 nurses, 1,700 bakers, 470 butchers, 945 garbage collectors and 5,300 janitors. The push for more social housing and other programs to make the city more affordable has coincided with the dominance of left-wing political parties, who came to power in 2001 after decades of right-wing rule.
But François Rochon, an urban planning consultant, said there is a functional consensus between right and left in France today on the need for public housing that mirrors some other European nations, but not the United States. "Living in social housing is not stigmatized," said Mr. Rochon, who pointed to its roots a century ago in France, when companies built apartments for their workers.
As a measure of the left-right alignment on the issue, Benoist Apparu, a former housing minister who served in a conservative government, described social housing as "absolutely essential."
"A city, if it's only made up of poor people, is a disaster," said Mr. Apparu, who now works for a property developer. "And if it's only made up of rich people, it's not much better."
Paris's housing program is part of the trade-off of the welfare state: affordable health care and education in exchange for some of the highest income-tax rates and social charges in Europe. Public housing, however, is increasingly available only for those lucky enough to get it.
There also is vestigial cynicism in Paris about public housing after a series of scandals in the 1990s, when some conservative politicians were revealed to be paying cheap rents for luxury city-owned apartments. Today, the city awards public housing through a system that strips the names of applicants and prioritizes them through a points system that factors income and family circumstances.
Mostly, resistance comes at the local level, Mr. Rochon said. Residents in central arrondissements, for example, have often pushed back against building public housing, and the neighborhoods remain bastions of the wealthy. There is also disagreement about how far the government can or should push public housing in the future. The current goal is for Paris to have 30 percent public housing for low-income residents and 10 percent for middle-income residents by 2035.
Mr. Baudrier, the Paris City Council member, said he believes that in the long term, 60 percent of housing in the city should be public and reserved for low- and middle-income families.
But building new public housing has been particularly challenging because so much of the city is already so densely packed -- and often protected by landmark status.
City planners have negotiated with the public railways to buy old train yards and rights of way. They've also seized on opportunities like the one that arose in 2018, when the French Defense Ministry consolidated its offices in Paris and the city negotiated to buy the l'Îlot Saint-Germain for well below market rates. The ensuing construction of 253 apartments was financed by the sale of part of the building to a Qatari investment fund, which is building a luxury hotel, as well as low-interest government loans that have durations as long as 50 to 80 years, according to Emmanuelle Cosse, a former housing minister.
City Hall has also taken over condemned buildings. Fabrice Chaillou, a father of two who manages computer networks, lives in public housing on the northern edge of Paris that was built from the ruins of a dilapidated neighborhood. He pays 980 euros a month for a three-bedroom apartment that he waited 10 years to get. Among his neighbors are a janitor, teachers, a car salesman and a police officer.
The program has allowed Mr. Chaillou and his wife to raise their two children in the city. But he knows that the future of social housing will always face at least one big challenge: "The problem is that once you get in, you never want to leave."

Toxic Beauty Standards Can Be Passed Down: [Op-Ed]

Full text: When my best friend and I lived together 13 years ago, our shared bathroom had a handful of products: soap, tanning lotion, deodorant, toothpaste, potpourri and maybe, occasionally, a face cream that one of us found on sale at Walgreens. No serums, no toners, no anti-aging products. We never considered we wouldn't be young forever. Our bank accounts were empty, our pores were clogged, our mascara wands were dry -- but we were 22, and we were allowed to be messy. We were allowed to be young.
Our generation came of age during the '90s toxic diet culture. Millennials weren't taught to fear aging; we were taught to fear fat. Butter was our enemy. When we watched Victoria's Secret Angels walk down the runaway, we loathed ourselves. Disordered eating may have been a psychiatric issue, but it was also symptomatic of a social problem. And if you had a mother who internalized diet culture and projected it onto her children, the damage could also happen from within the family. Researchers have found that mothers who encourage weight loss or food restriction or even express dissatisfaction with their body weight may lead to their daughters' becoming more likely to have eating-related problems.
As my generation grew up and became more conscious of the impacts of diet culture, we began to openly celebrate and encourage body positivity. Many of us became aware of our own body dysmorphia. We began seeing clearly how we were manipulated to shrink and hate every part of our bodies.
And yet, even if parts of society came to terms with natural bodies, the same cannot be said for the natural process of women aging. Wrinkles are the new enemy, and it seems Gen Z -- and their younger sisters -- are terrified of them. A recent video on TikTok that has garnered more than eight million views features a 28-year-old woman showing her "raw," procedure-free face, meaning no Botox or fillers. As some women and girls cheered on her bravery, others were left horrified. "Praying I'll never look like that," one comment read.
Gen Z-ers are being introduced to the idea of starting treatments early as preventive treatment. They are growing up in a culture of social media that promotes the endless pursuit of maintaining youth -- and at home, some of them are watching their mothers reject aging with every injectable and serum they can find. Jessica DeFino, a beauty writer, recently coined the term Serum Mom to describe a mother who is "obsessed with meeting a certain standard of beauty and nurtures the same obsession in her children."
For me, lessons of preventive skin care came from social media, not my mother. I was a few years shy of 30, digging into Instagram and series like Emily Weiss's Into the Gloss's Top Shelf. My skin care regimen suddenly became a 10-part routine, each step promising beauty and extended youth.
Since then, the rise of TikTok seems to have increased the way anti-aging beauty standards are consumed and internalized. Many girls and women now have endless access to social media posts of skin-care purchase hauls and plastic surgery before-and-after slide shows.
There's a nickname for tweens and teenagers who have been influenced by social media to get into skin care: Sephora Kids. Johanna Almstead, a fashion industry friend, tells me that in her local mothers group chat, nearly every mom had "Skincare, skincare, skincare!" on the holiday gift lists they were given -- by their fifth graders. Her 10-year-old daughter doesn't have access to social media, but she is exposed to this skin care obsession through friends, who are copying TikTok beauty influencers and whose parents are buying the products for them -- acids, peels and toners -- even though many of these products are meant for actually aging or acne-prone skin.
Representatives for the pricey brand Drunk Elephant (a tween favorite) posted on Instagram in December a list of products safe for kids and tweens. Buying a 10-year-old a colorfully packaged lip gloss or adult moisturizer may seem trivial, but it seems to me it can create a pipeline to a 15-year-old discussing forehead wrinkles on TikTok. We need to be wary of how the cosmetics industry can manipulate both mothers and kids and how, by backing it, we as mothers create a new set of worries for our children.
The anti-aging craze comes with the same toxicity as diet culture does. Serum Moms didn't create ageism, just as our mothers didn't create diet culture. But considering the speed at which social media is pushing ever more unattainable beauty standards onto children, it's time for us to consider our moral obligation to minimizing damage for the next generation.
Mothers are both victims and perpetrators of a culture that sells women the lie that we aren't enough exactly as we are. And yet, if a mother's insecurity can fuel her daughter's own self-loathing, a mother's radical self-love might just protect and even heal her daughter from a toxic culture. When I ask the few friends who haven't gotten Botox why they haven't, they tell me it's because they love how their mothers are aging and how they embrace it. They don't fear aging because their mothers don't (or didn't). Culture may set the tone for unattainable beauty standards, but we mothers and the women around us have power to change the trajectory of our daughters' insecurities and internal monologue.
I still think about my weight every day, but I fear that the impact of Serum Moms and anti-aging culture will be worse than the lessons I learned as I was growing up. I wish I grew up with women who truly nourished themselves -- mothers who ate when they were hungry; mothers who ate toast, pasta and birthday cake; mothers who simply ate. I look at my daughter's beautiful face, cheeks full of butter and innocence, and I want her to know that she's enough as is.

Body Positivity Advocates, Suddenly Slim: [Style Desk]

Full text: Do plus-size influencers owe their followers an explanation when their bodies change?
Tianna James used to love looking at the photographs Dronme Davis posted of herself on Instagram. Ms. Davis, a plus-size model, included pictures from her modeling campaigns alongside selfies of her stretch-marked stomach with captions like "fat belly saggy tits Sunday."
For Ms. James, 22, Ms. Davis's feed was a revelation. "I wanted to feel comfortable in my body, and she was like me in so many ways, so it made it easier to be myself," Ms. James said. "If I could find this person so beautiful, and she was bigger, I could find myself beautiful, too."
Ms. Davis gained a following through posts that criticized diet culture as she built a career as a curve model -- she wore up to a size 16 or XXL -- most prominently for Dôen, a California fashion brand known for floral prairie dresses typically worn by more willowy women. Her feed was a running commentary on the unrealistic expectation to conform to a thin ideal: "A flat stomach won't change your life" and "It's so exhausting being afraid and ashamed of parts of ur body."
Then, over just a few months, Ms. Davis shrank.
She still posted the artsy selfies Ms. James loved, but photos of soft belly rolls were replaced by sharp cheekbones and clavicles. She continued to write in her confessional style, sharing her feelings about everything from constipation to career insecurities. But Ms. Davis stopped posting her habitual rants against fatphobia, and she didn't explain why or how she had lost so much weight.
To Ms. James, Ms. Davis's silence felt like a betrayal.
"It made me feel like she was being dishonest with her community," Ms. James said. "I don't want to say it was owed to us, but it was such a drastic change."
The body positive movement has recently faltered in a cultural moment where thin is back in (though some argue it never really left), thanks in part to the rise of new drugs like Ozempic that are being used for weight loss. Celebrities, models and influencers like Ms. Davis who once celebrated their curves are grappling with how to discuss their smaller bodies, while their followers feel as if they've abandoned the causes they used to champion: encouraging people to challenge weight stigma and to accept themselves as they are.
'She Won't Cop to It'
Ms. Davis said that she had long agonized over how to publicly address her weight loss. Despite what some of her followers suspected, she wasn't on Ozempic. The truth -- that she had relapsed into the disordered eating practices that she had struggled with throughout her life -- was hard for her to admit, even to herself. How had she succumbed to the same pressures she had warned her nearly 100,000 followers about?
"The only thing people are going to be OK with is a very detailed explanation, which is not something I can write in a caption," the 24-year-old said by Zoom from her bedroom in the woods in Mendocino, Calif., where she lives with her mother.
She didn't want to beat herself up for relapsing, but she also empathized with followers like Ms. James.
"I gathered all these women to follow me because I was going to be inspiring and make them feel empowered," Ms. Davis said. "How can I still expect their attention and support?"
Ms. Davis grew up in a small town in Northern California. She put herself on a diet by the time she was 10, after she began to develop breasts. Her weight fluctuated, but when she was thinner, she said, she could fit into the Abercrombie miniskirts that her friends wore, and teachers took her more seriously.
She was discovered through her Instagram shortly after she graduated from high school, and soon landed a job as Dôen's first curve model. She has since modeled for much bigger brands, including Levi's, Sephora and The North Face, but she became a familiar fixture on Dôen's website: The designers have called her their "longtime muse" and named a pair of jeans that came in extended sizes after her.
As Ms. Davis grew up online, it felt natural to post about all the facets of her life -- not just her modeling, but her racial justice activism, her artwork and her evolving relationship to her body. Looking back, she said, in her passion to share her own learning process, she unintentionally positioned herself as an expert on body acceptance when that was not the case. It was a humbling experience and part of the reason she has not yet broached her weight loss publicly.
"I'm scared of being judged or yelled at or letting people down," she said. "Which is ironic, because I think my silence is letting people down more than me talking about it."
Some of the people who left comments on Ms. Davis's Instagram about her body were kind: "Worried about u ... hope you are ok." Some chastised her: "This sort of rapid and continued weight loss is concerning." And others were cruel, calling her "sickly skinny." When Ms. Davis started deleting comments, followers decamped to other online forums to speculate further.
"I figure it must be Ozempic like everyone else and she doesn't want to talk about it, which is a little off brand because she's so open about everything else," a user wrote on Reddit.
That commenter told The New York Times that she loved Ms. Davis regardless of her size, but still expected answers. "She talks about everything," she said. "Every pimple she has on her face, every rash she gets on her arm. So why hasn't she mentioned this?"
"She completely altered her body, and she won't cop to it," said another Instagram follower in an interview. She purchased Dôen items because Ms. Davis modeled them, including her namesake jeans. "If you're going to be out there using your body to make a living, and position yourself as a brand, and then you walk away from your brand, I think you can't expect the community around you to not react," she said.
'Life Is Too Hard in This Body'
Right now, body-positive influencers who have decided to be open about losing weight have also had to navigate a community that is often disappointed and angry.
The plus-size influencer Rosey Blair, who is taking Mounjaro, seemed defiant when she posted: "Full transparency: I have zero remorse or shame for being public about my weight loss. Two years ago, I couldn't wipe my own ass!" Critics called her ableist and self-hating.
"I left the body positive community because I wanted to be defined by my interests outside of my body," she posted in response.
One creator posted a how-to guide for followers who were wrestling with their reaction to people losing weight: "So, your favorite 'fat creator' doesn't want to be fat anymore? Here are 6 mindset tips to process their journey in a self-loving way for you." (Her advice in brief: unfollow.)
The longtime curve model Gabriella Lascano filmed a TikTok video last year about her decision to lose weight, explaining that she felt "guilty" for being part of the body-positive movement. She told The Times she hadn't been honest about "the trials and tribulations of gaining weight and getting older." People accused her of equating thinness with health and of producing content that could be used to "justify fatphobia." The outrage was so intense that she removed the video.
"I think it's strange to be so hurt when someone chooses something for themselves," Ms. Lascano said about the criticism she received.
But influencers' personal choices affect the community they've cultivated, often leaving followers, especially vulnerable young people, feeling disillusioned and adrift. Those who appear to flip-flop can cause "intense feelings of betrayal," said Sally A. Theran, a clinical psychologist and professor at Wellesley College who has researched parasocial relationships -- the one-sided ties people form with media figures and influencers -- and disordered eating in adolescence.
"I think if you're going to put yourself out there, and if you're going to earn money, then you're positioning yourself as a leader in this domain, and you should take responsibility for the repercussions," Ms. Theran said.
On a recent episode of the Burnt Toast podcast covering the rise of fat influencers losing weight, Virginia Sole-Smith, a journalist who writes about diet culture and who has contributed to The Times, said that influencers who once promoted fat acceptance but now claim they feel healthier when they are thinner are "throwing everyone else under the bus."
"You used the hashtags in order to grow your following in order to post your affiliate links, get your sponsor deals, all of that," Ms. Sole-Smith said. "So now what you're basically telling us is you co-opted all that rhetoric and you don't believe it at all, and that is pretty gross."
Her co-host Corinne Fay said she thought it was better for influencers to be upfront if they were using weight-loss drugs instead of vaguely claiming to be "pursuing health."
"They don't want to call it a diet, so it's called a health and fitness journey," Ms. Sole-Smith said. "That's pretty exasperating."
With Weight Loss Came Affirmation
Few people, if any, become body positive proponents without struggling with the same societal standards they speak out against. "I've seen creators say things like, 'It's just too hard, life is too hard, in this body,"' said Katie Sturino, a body acceptance advocate. "It can feel like betrayal, but it's a symptom of our culture and how in our society it is still the worst thing to be fat. People are still terrified of being in a bigger body."
Ms. Davis acknowledged that with her weight loss came affirmation -- more party invitations, more attention from men. "I so badly want to be like, 'What you look like doesn't matter,"' she said. "But it sure does change how people treat you."
When she relapsed, Ms. Davis convinced herself she was just trying to eat healthier and be more active. Soon though, she said, she was subsisting on rice cakes and Red Bull. When she ran into friends from the modeling world, she was forced to explain herself. (She pretended she was vegan.) Online, she could evade every question.
"Part of me was embarrassed and felt really guilty," Ms. Davis said. "All I ever wanted to do on the internet was make women feel OK about themselves."
Ms. Davis recently posted an Instagram video of herself posing in a bandanna top and cargo pants for a partnership with Free People. As always, she looks quirkily chic. She also looks thin.
She says she has good days and bad, but that she is trying to be more honest in conversations with friends. She often thinks of how her mother and her grandmother have also struggled with body image their entire lives.
She wants her followers to know that she meant it when she told them to reject fatphobia. "It was always coming from a place that was genuine," she said.
But given that she is still working on her own issues -- and given that she's no longer plus size -- she doesn't feel it's her place to advocate body positivity online.
"There was a time when I was in a body where I was experiencing fatphobia," she said. "Now that I'm not in that body currently, I don't think my voice is needed."
When Ms. James first noticed that Ms. Davis had lost weight, she unfollowed her. "I just didn't think that was good for me," she said. But then she noticed her feeds were full of people posting their exercise and diet routines. Ms. Davis was just one of many women who were no longer proudly plus size. Ms. James re-followed her. And recently, she said, she started working out and shedding pounds herself.
"I guess weight is just as much of a trend as anything else," Ms. James said.

Can You Optimize an Orgasm?: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An array of smart sex toys cater to those who want to take a data-driven approach to their pleasure.
After Melissa, a 35-year-old event planner living in Chicago, masturbates, she sometimes studies a chart that resembles the output of a heart rate monitor or that of a seismograph capturing an earthquake.
The data is generated by her vibrator, the Lioness, which measures her arousal and uploads information about her orgasm patterns to the company's app. The sensors embedded in the toy track her pelvic floor movements. With each involuntary squeeze and release of her pelvic floor muscles, the app displays a graph showing her rhythmic pattern in a series of peaks and valleys. She typically uses it in tandem with her other clitoral stimulating vibrators, so that she can compare the orgasms she experiences with each one.
"I use it just as a data collection dildo, essentially," said Melissa, who asked to be identified only by her first name because of privacy concerns. Besides the Lioness, she doesn't own any wearable activity trackers, like the popular Apple Watch or Fitbit, but she says she likes "to have quantifiable information when I'm learning things."
Whether it's obsessively collecting step counts or waiting for Spotify to reveal our musical tastes each year, we may be growing more accustomed to tracking every aspect of our lives through technology. The option to track female orgasms at home introduces the possibility of hacking what some scientists have treated as an enigma. Some people use the tracking technology to combat sexual changes that can come with menopause or polycystic ovary syndrome, for example. Others say they want the data to see how certain foods or medications may affect their arousal -- and they're thinking about how to optimize their orgasms with smart, Bluetooth-enabled sex toys they hope will help them better understand their bodies.
"We really call it a tool for 'sexperiments,' so doing experiments with yourself or with partners -- how caffeine can have an effect on your orgasms, how alcohol, how CBD, how stress, all these things," said Anna Lee, the chief executive and co-founder of Lioness.
Ms. Lee started the company about eight years ago with Liz Klinger, and the pair pitch their vibrators as a way for people to have "smarter" orgasms, joining a wave of everyday devices that are connected to the internet.
As sex toys have gotten smarter, they have been advertised as far more than sources of pleasure. Now available for purchase in stores like Target and Sephora rather than just sex shops, these toys may pledge to help users practice self-care or sexual wellness, offering people -- particularly women -- the glimmering promise of a fully optimized life. They've also introduced some pitfalls. Devices that collect data can be subject to data hacks, and some experts have warned that sex toys that track orgasms could become sources of tension with a partner.
"A sex toy can be a collaborator but not a competitor," said Jamye Waxman, a therapist and sex educator in Los Angeles. "And I think you have to start to notice if it's keeping score."
Lioness isn't the only device on the market offers users data. Perifit, while not a vibrator, is a Kegel exercise device that allows users to connect to an app where they can play Kegel games to strengthen their pelvic floor and track their contractions.
And Wujj, a sex tech company whose devices also use sensors to measure and improve orgasms, is set to begin beta testing this month. Its namesake product is a flexible U-shaped silicone toy that comes in flesh-toned colors that will also include a phone app with A.I.-powered audio erotica, how-to videos, insights from OB-GYNs and guided meditations.
Penda N'diaye, the founder and chief executive of the brand, said that the goal wasn't to "pathologize orgasms" but to give users the tools to understand themselves. She uses words like "biofeedback" or "machine learning" to talk about Wujj -- terms that aren't usually associated with masturbation and sexual pleasure. But she said it's those features that allow users to receive information that's useful for their bodies.
Ms. N'diaye, who also is the founder of Pro Hoe, an organization for sexual wellness and sex education for women of color, said she had found that having "the gumption" and "boldness" to go after what you want sexually -- and not wait to be chosen or remain on the receiving end -- could be transformative.
Ms. Waxman said the orgasm tracking devices could also be beneficial for women who were perimenopausal or menopausal, or who were taking medications like S.S.R.I.s, which can make it challenging to have a satisfactory orgasm.
"The pros are it can really help us understand from a physiological perspective what's going on, which can then help with the psychological perspective," she said. "If the toy creates an opportunity for discussion with your partner around what you're experiencing and what's giving you pleasure, then I think that can be a really huge positive."
But the frequent use of vibrators and sex toys may also create space for judgment, resentment and avoidance, she said, if a person and his or her partner cannot achieve the same level of pleasure that a toy can offer.
"If you are really into monitoring your orgasms and they start to change or you're not having the same, huge orgasmic experiences, and that starts to change, the concern is 'now something's wrong with me because this isn't happening,"' she said.
To strike a balance, Ms. Waxman said smart sex toy users might use the data from their devices as a jumping-off point for a vulnerable conversation.
"If you notice that you're using your vibrator at 11 a.m. because that's the time you're most aroused, but your partner is working, then there is a conversation about timing that you have to have and that maybe on weekends you set aside 11 a.m." she said.
Not everyone is so sure that an optimized orgasm is really the best kind of orgasm. Lioness includes a "live view" that allows users to see their orgasm chart develop in real time and log when they are about to climax.
April Damaso, a 33-year-old tech designer living in Vancouver, British Columbia, said she was excited about the product but that the tracking feature could be distracting. Sometimes it "takes away from the experience," she said.
Ms. Damaso, who identifies as lesbian, said that the toy's tracking function had limited use for her, as it only works if it's inserted. "I'm not somebody who likes penetration all the time," she said.
Data capture also increases concerns over privacy when it comes to smart sex toys. While brands like Lioness state in their privacy policies that user data is encrypted, and many companies do not require users to sign up with identifiable information, other brands have come under fire for their practices. In 2017, a Canadian sex toy company, We-Vibe, was ordered to pay customers up to 10,000 Canadian dollars each as part of a class-action lawsuit after the smart vibrator tracked owners' use without their knowledge.
As for Melissa, she isn't using the Lioness to chart "every single" orgasm she's had, but she uses it "every once in a while," such as when she's had a strong cup of coffee and wants to see how it affects her body's response.
"I am very much an advocate of sex education," she added, "and I think even adults are still learning about their bodies and learning about self-pleasure."

'Everything's Gone.' Flooded San Diego Digs Out.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The San Diego region was overwhelmed by a surprisingly intense storm that flooded homes and turned roadways into rivers. Some residents wondered why they did not receive more warning.
They fled to rooftops. Deserted cars in the middle of raging waters. Grabbed kayaks to traverse flooded streets. Searched for neighbors and cried out to strangers.
The rare torrent of rain that slammed the San Diego area on Monday forced numerous residents to navigate life-threatening scenes that they had trouble believing even as they recounted them.
The authorities would later call it a miracle that no one died and very few people were injured in a suddenly calamitous storm that prompted state and local leaders to declare a state of emergency.
"What happened yesterday was extraordinary," said Todd Gloria, the mayor of San Diego.
On Tuesday, officials assessed the devastation in a region where very few residents have flood insurance. The record pace of the rainfall -- a deluge of nearly three inches in three hours -- had quickly overwhelmed drainage systems. According to the National Weather Service, it was the fourth greatest total for any day in recorded San Diego history, going back to 1850.
Many residents face losses that feel more impossible than their harrowing escapes. Some wondered why government officials had not done more to warn residents or call on them to evacuate before they were surrounded by floodwaters. Others were still in disbelief that their belongings were destroyed in an instant.
"Electronics, clothes, pictures, memories, everything's gone. I lost everything in that flood," Luis Reyes said of the apartment that he shares with his family. "All my memories are gone."
Mr. Reyes, 18, had been at their home in National City, just south of San Diego, when the water rushed in and quickly rose to his waist. His parents and sister had already left for the day. He managed to snatch a shoebox of greeting cards and his two Chihuahuas, before climbing out his bedroom window. Outside, he saw floating vehicles crashing into one another.
"It just felt like a scene out of an apocalyptic movie," said Mr. Reyes, who works as a Starbucks barista.
Residents a few miles away in the Southcrest neighborhood of San Diego were mucking out yards filled with debris, overwhelmed by the task that lay ahead inside their homes where mud coated the floors. Broken fences sat in disarray on the streets. Soiled furniture dotted the sidewalks.
Duncan MacLuan, 34, and his roommate had climbed to their roof during the storm and waited hours for the water to subside. They watched others do the same. Some residents hopped on Jet Skis or longboards to try to help rescue stranded people and pets.
"We had dogs and cats on the roof right next to us," Mr. MacLuan said. "It was insane. I have never seen anything like that."
A neighbor's chickens in a coop ended up drowning, he added.
Mr. MacLuan grew up in North Carolina and said he was used to hurricanes. But this experience rattled him. He had received an alert on his phone about a possible flash flood, but said it arrived too late.
"The rain was already eight inches deep by the time the warning came," Mr. MacLuan said.
The National Weather Service issued two flash flood warnings for different parts of the region: one at 8:21 a.m. for the northern part of the county, and one at 9:34 for other areas, including the city of San Diego. Each was followed by emergency cellphone alerts to some residents.
"The magnitude and the intensity was under-predicted," said Alex Tardy, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego. Mr. Tardy said that the agency had correctly predicted the total amount of rain days in advance, but that the intensity had been double what was expected in a region where forecasting can be difficult.
"A lot of places in the country don't have a giant ocean next door, and they don't have hills and different types of terrain," Mr. Tardy said. "So there's complications there. It's not really an excuse, but there's always those variables."
As was the case elsewhere in California during last year's atmospheric rivers, several of the neighborhoods that were struck on Monday were among the most impoverished in San Diego. Residents whose homes were flooded said they had been concerned for years that nearby channels had not been properly maintained and left them vulnerable.
"These communities of concern, these underinvested communities have clearly and demonstrably been the hardest hit throughout the region," said Leslie Reynolds, executive director of Groundwork San Diego-Chollas Creek, which works with residents and nonprofits along the Chollas Creek Watershed that was overwhelmed on Monday. "These are redlined communities with disproportionate pollution, unemployment, chronic health conditions, and all of these are going to be exacerbated by coming climate challenges. It is heartbreaking."
Representative Juan Vargas, a Democrat whose district encompasses southwestern San Diego County, starting along the Mexican border, said on Tuesday that his office was fielding calls from distraught homeowners wondering how they would pay for the damages. A mere 8,128 households out of 1.15 million in San Diego County have flood insurance.
"A lot of people are not insured and a lot of people are going to have lots of damage," Mr. Vargas said, adding that his office is working with the federal government to see what help is available.
"We're trying to figure that out right now with FEMA to see if there's anything we can do for them," he said. "And the damage is extensive."
Driving around his district during the storm, Mr. Vargas noticed clogged drainage canals, which he said meant that lawsuits against local governments were likely.
"Certainly the city for whatever reason wasn't able to maintain them," Mr. Vargas said. "Cities have tight budgets, and I feel for them."
Officials with the city of San Diego estimated that it had suffered $ 6 million to $ 7 million in damage to its infrastructure. Mayor Gloria said that no drainage system would have been able to handle the sudden deluge that hit San Diego on Monday, but he acknowledged that the city needed to build more storm defense in the future. He said residents might have to pay more for upgrades and maintenance as climate change causes more intense storms.
"What rain patterns were before is not what they are today, and they're not what they are moving forward," said Kris McFadden, the deputy chief operating officer for the city. "That's something we need to plan for."
On Tuesday morning, the Reyes family, who had spent the night at a shelter, returned to the home they had lived in for a decade to take stock of what they could salvage. They found only a swampy mess.
Dirt coated the soggy carpet. Water puddled across the linoleum floor. The couches they had recently bought were entirely soaked. Their belongings had been tossed about, littered across the rooms. A musty smell drifted throughout.
Dulce Reyes, 24, had just gotten a job at Sephora after two months of being unemployed and wondered how she would be able to make it to work. The family's cars had been underwater. They were relying on rides from friends.
Any hope they had mustered overnight had dissipated at the sight of what would be an overwhelming cleanup task.
"Everything is just a mess," she said. "It's just like restarting all over."

Watching A Clown Car Break Down: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Inside the halls of power, his performance worked for a time. Outside, he's a flop.
George Santos was expelled from Congress on a Friday in December. On the next business day, he announced a new role: as a kind of clown-for-hire on Cameo, an app and website where he offered his services recording personalized videos for fans. First he priced the messages at $ 75 each, but soon he was charging $ 200, then $ 400, then $ 500 a pop. But last week, the market contracted. The videos dropped to $ 350 apiece.
Working through Santos's Cameo oeuvre -- there is a TikTok account, @georgiescameos, that collects clips -- is a miserable exercise. In a typical offering, he sits in a featureless apartment or a darkened SUV. His face appears glassy with Botox, his eyes searching for the script. He plods through condolences and congratulations. He says "slay, girl," he says "kill it," he says "diva down." Sometimes he winkingly refers to the fraud allegations against him. He signs off with an air kiss. Mwah. Cha-ching.
I felt sick watching the videos -- not because they have enriched a fabulist, but because they are so tedious and flat. There was once a transgressive appeal to the Santos persona. As he pinballed erratically through the halls of Congress, his deceptions dented the self-serious reputation of the American government itself. It was the inappropriateness of his high status that made him amusing. Now that he's been brought low, viral fame supplies no tension for a Santos character. There is nothing transgressive about a grifter on Cameo.
Santos is right to intuit that his political downfall held a kind of entertainment value. Bowen Yang assumed his form repeatedly on "Saturday Night Live" last year, playing him as a languid and pathological sprite. There was a Mad-Libs quality to Santos's claims, a giddy randomness that felt tuned toward social media. He said he had family trauma from Sept. 11 and the Holocaust; that he had worked at Goldman Sachs and on "Hannah Montana"; that he played competitive volleyball and saved puppies. (None of it was true). As reporters chased him down, his erratic on-camera performances -- tripping over the door to his office, or inexplicably holding a baby -- seemed to pop against the hardwood interiors of Congress.
Among Santos's audience of not-quite fans, his misdeeds came to feel both absurd and relatable. Even when he was formally charged with serious crimes (among them, conspiracy, wire fraud, credit card fraud and identity theft, all of which he denies), the details were deliciously petty. The House Ethics Report released in November told of campaign funds spent on Botox injections, OnlyFans subscriptions, Sephora products. Trump converted politics into camp, and now there was an actual "Drag Race" fan in Congress, one who was versed in the genre's tropes and who seemed to live for messy drama.
When his colleagues voted to boot him from office, making him just the sixth member in history to be expelled from the House of Representatives, the phrase "DIVA DOWN" trended on Twitter. Compared to the power that actually functional legislators can wield over our lives, his crimes passed as low-stakes, almost cute. A millennial in his flop era.
Now Santos is hoping to ride his political scandal into some kind of influencer role. But like a comic book villain, he has landed in a new dimension only to find that his superpowers have dissipated. He keeps insisting that he's an "icon," but his act is unwatchable off the political stage. His story was riveting not because he had any special charisma, but because the reporters on his case worked so persistently, uncovering his lies with such thrilling speed that he seemed to be a more dynamic character than he really was.
Even as trolls (Jimmy Kimmel among them) attempt to prank Santos, submitting increasingly ludicrous prompts for his Cameo videos, the results have proved frustratingly boring. A one-minute video where he offers garbled congratulations to a woman for transferring her dead husband's spirit into a mannequin -- "I look forward for you to enjoying in making all those new memories now with your new beau Jacob in his new vessel, bye!" -- proves only that he will say anything.
In his defense, a Cameo is rarely interesting as content. A video from a famous person has a meta value; there is a satisfaction to be claimed by drawing an untouchable person close. It can feel like a form of power, to use a celebrity as your ventriloquist dummy for a minute or two. There's a touch of humiliation to the exercise, for both parties. But Santos is hardly untouchable, and he is seemingly immune from embarrassment.
Two weeks after his expulsion from Congress, Santos sat for an interview with the comedian Ziwe for her YouTube channel. Some grumbled that it was inadvisable for her to further publicize Santos, but the accusation feels like a shifting of blame: Our standards were low enough to elevate him to Congress, but YouTube is where we draw the line? In the segment, Ziwe was as sharp as Santos was sloppy -- "What advice do you have for young diverse people with personality disorders considering a career in politics?" she asked -- but he was so shifty, she couldn't quite pin him down.
When Ziwe asked, "What can we do to get you to go away?" he had an answer: "Stop inviting me to your gigs." Then he added, softly: "But you can't. Because people want the content."
There it was, a moment of truth from George Santos. But the value of his content is dropping, and he has expensive tastes.

Full text: Karissa Bodnar played on her customers' desire to belong to something bigger than ... well, beauty.
On a recent Monday, Karissa Bodnar, the 34-year-old founder and chief executive of Thrive, a cosmetics company, arrived at a launch party for her latest product line. The setting: a fluorescent-lit, fifth-floor office in midtown Manhattan. The bells and whistles: cheese, crudités, basic beer and wine. The entertainment: a Bluetooth speaker playing early aughts hip-hop (Flo Rida, Lil Jon).
Over the next three hours, dozens of makeup artists, beauty editors and social media influencers accustomed to launch parties in far-flung locales like Tokyo and the South of France would drop by. Maybe.
"Respectfully, I don't care if editors and influencers show up or not," Ms. Bodnar said, surveying the windowless reception area. She wore a skirt suit of turquoise and silver sequins that cast a disco-ball glow across the floor. "I had $ 25,000 to spend, and I wasn't going to do a lunch at the Four Seasons or rent a house for the summer so influencers could go take selfies."
As far as beauty marketing goes, events like the two Ms. Bodnar cited are relatively thrifty. In January, Tarte conspicuously flew 50 influencers and their plus ones to Dubai and put them up at a Ritz-Carlton to celebrate the introduction of a foundation made with a "multitasking superfruit." Last year, Chanel flew influencers to Panama to fete a new beauty line; in 2017, Smashbox feted new products in Fiji.
For the April debut of Bigger Than Beauty, a set of skin-care products, Ms. Bodnar chose the headquarters of Bottomless Closet, a nonprofit that helps New York-area women in need enter the work force. "We found out about them through our community," Ms. Bodnar said. "We post on social media all the time and ask, 'What charities are moving you?"'
Thrive donated a million dollars of product but the real windfall for the nonprofit may have been the fairy godmother who chose to wave her wand over them.
"She's the star," Melissa Norden, the executive director of Bottomless Closet, said, gesturing at Ms. Bodnar. "People won't show up for us. They'll show up for her."
Much has been made of the Rihannas and Kylie Jenners of the beauty industry, celebrities who introduced best-selling cosmetics brands after developing an ardent following. One could argue that given the high profiles of their founders, Fenty Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics were destined for success. To build a brand -- and to fill a room -- Ms. Bodnar has played not on her name but on consumers' desire to do good with their dollars and belong to something bigger than ... well, beauty. Call her the Estée Lauder that hustle culture built.
"A lot of launch events would be at some swanky place," Ms. Bodnar told the assemblage. "I grew up on a dirt road. I don't know about you, but I'm kind of over the swanky events. I think this is the new swanky event -- being at places like Bottomless Closet." Cheers erupted.
'The Ultimate Unicorn'
If Ms. Bodnar was only about doing good, Thrive Causemetics -- the company's official name, one that gives pause to anyone with an ounce of skepticism -- would be a nonprofit.
"I've always thought of her as the ultimate unicorn," said Blythe Jack, a Thrive investor and a former partner at TSG Consumer, a private equity firm in San Francisco. "She built a wildly profitable business on almost no capital." Ms. Jack invested $ 100,000 in Thrive in 2017.
Thrive is a direct-to-consumer brand, avoiding the distribution fees associated with selling through Sephora or department stores. It's a common path for star-founded companies -- it's how Kylie Cosmetics started -- but star power can only do so much.
"Karissa was able to build community and brand loyalty before the marketplace got flooded and the pandemic shifted everything," said Priya Rao, the executive editor of the Business of Beauty, which chronicles the industry.
Thrive declined to comment on its annual revenues. "I don't want to be out there baring all to everybody," Ms. Bodnar said. "I've earned my spot."
The Reckoning
If Ms. Bodnar is cagey about specifics, it's because she has faced controversy. There's the plaintiff who sued Thrive in 2018, alleging that the company was not donating to charities in the way that it claimed. (The lawsuit resulted in a "stipulated" dismissal; Ms. Bodnar signed a non-disparagement agreement that precludes her from talking about it.) There are the trolls who harassed her on social media when Forbes added her, in 2019, to its "richest women" list.
"It was actually quite scary when that list came out," said Ms. Bodnar, who splits her time between Seattle and Los Angeles, where Thrive is headquartered.
Ms. Bodnar grew up in rural Washington State. "We went to church every Sunday, but Allure was my bible," she said. She worked at Sephora to pay her way through community college, which led to a job at the Seattle office of Clarisonic, a maker of a mechanical face brush that L'Oréal acquired in 2011.
"Among all these men on the team, she was very impressive," Carol Hamilton, the president for acquisitions for L'Oréal U.S.A., recalled. "She wanted to understand the 'why' of the work, how big companies operate."
In 2013, Ms. Bodnar's close friend, Kristy LeMond, who had been working in the nonprofit sector, died of soft tissue sarcoma, a rare cancer. Ms. Bodnar had a reckoning. She quit L'Oréal. She bought a bunch of makeup. She wrote a business plan in the notes app of her iPhone: vegan makeup with a business model that mimicked Toms and Warby Parker, the pioneers of the buy one, give one model.
She got a day job at Bulletproof, the supplement company, to finance her after-hours innovations, like false eyelashes that "work whether you have lashes or not," Ms. Bodnar said. "So much of what I heard in the beginning was, 'If a women's going through cancer, we tell her not to wear makeup.' I was like, 'That's not an acceptable response."'
Like any star, Thrive needed a breakout hit, and in 2014, Ms. Bodnar found hers: Liquid Lash Extensions, a mascara that encases eyelashes in tiny, ziti-like tubes. The mascara adheres to a degree that may find users ripping out their lashes if a generous amount of makeup remover isn't used to dissolve the residue.
Customers seemed unbothered. "Best mascara ever" reads a recent review on Thrive's website, one of more than 34,000 reviews posted for the mascara. "We sell one every five seconds," Ms. Bodnar said.
Social Conscience as a Strategy
Combined, Ms. Bodnar and Thrive have more than 830,000 Instagram followers; by comparison, L'Oréal U.S.A. has just over 150,000. Her direct messages with customers turn into real-life meet-ups: "This woman just invited me to run a half marathon," Ms. Bodnar said, showing her phone screen.
"The conglomerates are always looking to update their portfolios," Ms. Rao said, "and they're desperate to connect with millennial and Gen Z consumers in the way that Thrive has."
Ms. Bodnar said she has turned down offers to sell. What about an I.P.O.? "My goal is to donate a billion dollars," she said. Thus far, she has donated $ 125 million, which a public offering would likely preclude. "I'm not trying to create a flash-in-the-pan brand," she said.
Employee-generated content fuels Thrive's social media feeds as well as ire. An April, Instagram post of a male employee applying concealer, eyebrow gel and pressed powder generated a slew of hateful comments and disavowals like, "If this is turning into a 'woke' company, I'll stop buying."
"People get very upset about the L.G.B.T.Q.-plus and reproductive rights stances we take," Ms. Bodnar said. "I would have thought that those same people would care about our immigration support, but ...." She shrugged.
There are advantages to stoking discord.
"You might take a stance on a divisive issue because you know that your target customer is likely to take the same stance," said Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "You may be doing it because you care about that issue, but you may also get attention from it."
Ms. Bodnar claims to care about making a difference but social conscience can also serve as a strategy. Half a dozen employees (the company has about 100, total) had filed in for a weekly product development meeting in a glass-walled conference room at Thrive headquarters on the west side of Los Angeles. Ms. Bodnar sat at the head of the table. Lipstick prototypes were smudged on hands and analyzed under varying shades of light. Someone brought up their competition.
"That makes me think of one of my favorite books," Ms. Bodnar said. "The Infinite Game" by Simon Sinek. "We think that business is a finite game," she said, "but you can't win a business in the same way that you can't win a friendship, or a marriage. He talks about worthy rivals."
"Who's a worthy rival?" she asked the room.
One employee: "Lululemon."
Another: "Patagonia."
Ms. Bodnar smiled. No one had mentioned another makeup brand. "OK," she said. "What's next?"

Pay-Later Loans Put Some At Risk for 'Phantom Debt': [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Buying mattresses, clothes and other goods on installment plans has propped up spending, but economists worry that such loans could put some people at risk.
"Buy now, pay later" loans are helping to fuel a record-setting holiday shopping season. Economists worry they could also be masking and exacerbating cracks in Americans' financial well-being.
The loans, which allow consumers to pay for purchases in installments, often interest-free, have soared in popularity because of high prices and interest rates. Retailers have used them to attract customers and to get people to spend more.
But such loans may be encouraging younger and lower-income Americans to take on too much debt, according to consumer groups and some lawmakers. And because such loans aren't routinely reported to credit bureaus or captured in public data, they could also represent a hidden source of risk to the financial system.
"The more I dig into it, the more concerned I am," said Tim Quinlan, a Wells Fargo economist who recently published a report that described pay-later loans as "phantom debt."
Traditional measures of consumer credit indicate that U.S. household finances overall are relatively healthy. But, Mr. Quinlan said, "if those are missing the fastest-growing piece of the market, then those reassurances aren't worth a darn."
Estimates of the size of this market vary widely. Mr. Quinlan thinks that spending through pay-later options was about $ 46 billion this year. That is small when compared with the more than $ 3 trillion that Americans put on their credit cards last year.
But such loans -- offered by companies like Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay and PayPal -- have climbed fast at a moment when the finances of some Americans are showing early signs of strain.
Credit card borrowing is at a record high in dollar terms -- though not as a share of income -- and delinquencies, though low by historical standards, are rising. That stress is especially evident among younger adults.
People in their 20s and 30s are by far the biggest users of pay-later loans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That could be both a sign of financial problems -- young people may be using pay-later loans after maxing out credit cards -- and a cause of it by encouraging them to spend excessively.
Liz Cisneros, a 23-year-old college student in Chicago who works part time at Home Depot, said she was surprised by the ease of pay-later programs. During the pandemic, she saw influencers on TikTok promoting the loans, and a friend said they helped her buy designer shoes.
Ms. Cisneros started using them to buy clothes, shoes and Sephora beauty products. She often had multiple loans at a time. She realized she was overspending when she didn't have enough money while in a grocery checkout line. A pay-later company had withdrawn funds from her bank account that morning, and she had lost track of her payment schedule.
"It's easy when you keep continually clicking and clicking and clicking, and then it's not," she said, referring to when she realizes she has spent too much.
Ms. Cisneros said the problem was particularly intense around Christmas, and this year she was not shopping for the holiday so she could pay off her debts.
Pay-later loans became available in the United States years ago, but they took off during the pandemic when online shopping surged.
The products are somewhat similar to the layaway programs offered decades earlier by retailers. Online shoppers can choose from pay-later options at checkout or on the apps of pay-later companies. The loans are also available at some physical stores; Affirm said on Tuesday that it had started offering pay-later loans at the self-checkout counters at Walmart stores.
The most common loans require buyers to pay a quarter of the purchase price upfront with the rest usually paid in three installments over six weeks. Such loans are typically interest-free, though users sometimes end up owing fees. Pay-later companies make most of their money by charging fees to retailers.
Some lenders also offer interest-bearing loans with repayment terms that can last a few months to more than a year.
Pay-later companies say their products are better for borrowers than credit cards or payday loans. They say that by offering shorter loans, they can better assess borrowers' ability to repay.
"We're able to identify and extend credit to consumers who have the ability and willingness to repay above that of revolving credit accounts," Michael Linford, Affirm's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
In its most recent quarter, 2.4 percent of Affirm's loans were delinquent by 30 days or longer, down from 2.7 percent a year earlier. Those numbers exclude its four-payment loans.
The service makes the most sense for certain purchases, like buying an expensive sweater that will last many years, said the chief executive of Klarna, Sebastian Siemiatkowski.
He said pay later probably made less sense for more frequent purchases like groceries, though Klarna and other companies do make their loans available at some grocery stores.
Mr. Siemiatkowski acknowledged that people could misuse his company's loans.
"Obviously it's still credit, and so you're going to find a subset of individuals who unfortunately are using it in not the way intended," said Mr. Siemiatkowski, who founded Klarna in 2005. He said the company tried to identify those users and deny them loans or impose stricter terms on them.
Klarna, which is based in Stockholm, says its global default rates are less than 1 percent. In the United States, more than a third of customers repay loans early.
Kelsey Greco made her first pay-later purchase about four years ago to buy a mattress. Paying $ 1,200 in cash would have been difficult, and putting the purchase on a credit card seemed unwise. So she got a 12-month, interest-free loan from Affirm.
Since then, Ms. Greco, 30, has used Affirm regularly, including for a Dyson hair tool and car brakes. Some of the loans charged interest, but she said that even then she preferred this form of borrowing because it was clear how much she would pay and when.
"With a credit card, you can swipe it all day long and be like, 'Wait, what did I just get myself into?"' Ms. Greco, a Denver resident, said. "Whereas with Affirm, it's giving you these clear-cut numbers where you can see, 'OK, this makes sense' or 'This doesn't make sense."'
Ms. Greco, who was introduced to The New York Times by Affirm, said pay-later loans helped her avoid credit card debt, with which she previously had trouble.
But not all consumers use pay-later options carefully. A report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau this year found that nearly 43 percent of pay-later users had overdrawn a bank account in the previous 12 months, compared with 17 percent of nonusers.
"This is just a more vulnerable portion of the population," said Ed deHaan, a researcher at Stanford University.
In a paper published last year, Mr. deHaan and three other scholars found that within a month of first using pay-later loans, people became more likely to experience overdrafts and to start accruing credit card late fees.
Financial advisers who work with low-income Americans say more clients are using pay-later loans.
Barbara L. Martinez, a financial counselor in Chicago who works at Heartland Alliance, a nonprofit group, said many of her clients used cash advances to cover pay-later loans. When paychecks arrive, they don't have enough to cover bills, forcing them to turn to more pay-later loans.
"It is not that the product is bad," she added, but "it can get out of control really fast and cause a lot of damage that could be prevented."
Briana Gordley learned about pay-later products in college. She was working part time and couldn't get approved for a credit card, but pay-later providers were eager to extend her credit. She started falling behind when her work hours were reduced. Eventually, family and friends helped her repay the debts.
Ms. Gordley, who testified about her experience last year in a listening session hosted by the Senate, now works on consumer finance issues for Texas Appleseed, a progressive policy organization. She said pay-later loans could be an important source of credit for communities that lacked access to traditional loans. She still uses them occasionally for larger purchases.
But she said companies and regulators needed to make sure that borrowers could afford the debt they were taking on. "If we're going to create these products and build out these systems for people, we also just have to have some checks and balances in place."
The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 requires credit card companies and other lenders to disclose interest rates and fees and provides borrowers with various protections, including the ability to dispute charges. But the act applies only to loans with more than four payment installments, effectively excluding many pay-later loans.
Many such loans also aren't reported to credit agencies. As a result, consumers could have multiple loans with Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm without the companies knowing about the other debts.
"It's a huge blind spot right now, and we all know that," said Liz Pagel, a senior vice president at TransUnion who oversees the company's consumer lending business.
TransUnion and other major credit bureaus and pay-later companies all say they are supportive of more reporting.
But there are practical hurdles. The credit-rating system rates borrowers more highly for having longer-term loans, including longstanding credit card accounts. Each pay-later purchase qualifies as a separate loan. As a result, those loans could lower the scores of borrowers even if they repay them on time.
Ms. Pagel said TransUnion had created a new reporting system for the loans. Other credit bureaus, such as Experian and Equifax, are doing the same.
Pay-later firms say they are reporting certain loans, particularly ones with longer terms. But most are not reporting and won't commit to reporting loans with just four payments.
That worries economists who say they are particularly concerned about how such loans will play out when the economy weakens and workers start losing their jobs.
Marco di Maggio, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied pay-later products, said that when times were tough more people would use such loans for smaller expenses and get into trouble. "You only need one more shock to push people into default."

“Obviously it’s still credit and so you’re going to find a subset of individuals who unfortunately are using it in not the way intended,” said Siemiatkowski, who founded Klarna in 2005. He said the company tried to identify those users and deny them loans or impose stricter terms on them.
Klarna, which is based in Stockholm, said its global default rates are less than 1%. In the United States, more than one-third of customers repay loans early.
Kelsey Greco made her first pay-later purchase about four years ago to buy a mattress. Paying $1,200 in cash would have been difficult, and putting the purchase on a credit card seemed unwise. So she got a 12-month, interest-free loan from Affirm.
Since then, Greco, 30, has used Affirm regularly, including for a Dyson hair tool and car brakes. Some of the loans charged interest, but she said that even then she preferred this form of borrowing because it was clear how much she would pay and when.
“With a credit card, you can swipe it all day long and be like, ‘Wait, what did I just get myself into?’” said Greco, a Denver resident. “Whereas with Affirm, it’s giving you these clear-cut numbers where you can see, ‘OK, this makes sense’ or ‘This doesn’t make sense.’”
Greco, who was introduced to The New York Times by Affirm, said pay-later loans helped her avoid credit card debt, with which she previously had trouble.
But not all consumers use pay-later options carefully. A report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau this year found that nearly 43% of pay-later users had overdrawn a bank account in the previous 12 months, compared with 17% of nonusers.
“This is just a more vulnerable portion of the population,” said Ed deHaan, a researcher at Stanford University.
In a paper published last year, deHaan and three other scholars found that within a month of first using pay-later loans, people became more likely to experience overdrafts and to start accruing credit card late fees.
Financial advisers who work with low-income Americans say more clients are using pay-later loans.
Barbara L. Martinez, a financial counselor in Chicago who works at Heartland Alliance, a nonprofit group, said many of her clients used cash advances to cover pay-later loans. When paychecks arrive, they don’t have enough to cover bills, forcing them to turn to more pay-later loans.
“It is not that the product is bad,” she added, but “it can get out of control really fast and cause a lot of damage that could be prevented.”
Briana Gordley learned about pay-later products in college. She was working part time and couldn’t get approved for a credit card, but pay-later providers were eager to extend her credit. She started falling behind when her work hours were reduced. Eventually, family and friends helped her repay the debts.
Gordley, who testified about her experience last year in a listening session hosted by the Senate, now works on consumer finance issues for Texas Appleseed, a progressive policy organization. She said pay-later loans could be an important source of credit for communities that lacked access to traditional loans. She still uses them occasionally for larger purchases.
But she said companies and regulators needed to make sure that borrowers could afford the debt they were taking on. “If we’re going to create these products and build out these systems for people, we also just have to have some checks and balances in place.”
The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 requires credit card companies and other lenders to disclose interest rates and fees and provides borrowers with various protections, including the ability to dispute charges. But the act applies only to loans with more than four payment installments, effectively excluding many pay-later loans.
Many such loans also aren’t reported to credit agencies. As a result, consumers could have multiple loans with Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm without the companies knowing about the other debts.
“It’s a huge blind spot right now, and we all know that,” said Liz Pagel, a senior vice president at TransUnion who oversees the company’s consumer lending business.
TransUnion and other major credit bureaus and pay-later companies all say they are supportive of more reporting.
But there are practical hurdles. The credit-rating system rates borrowers more highly for having longer-term loans, including long-standing credit card accounts. Each pay-later purchase qualifies as a separate loan. As a result, those loans could lower the scores of borrowers even if they repay them on time.
Pagel said TransUnion had created a new reporting system for the loans. Other credit bureaus, such as Experian and Equifax, are doing the same.
Pay-later firms say they are reporting certain loans, particularly ones with longer terms. But most are not reporting and won’t commit to reporting loans with just four payments.
That worries economists who say they are particularly concerned about how such loans will play out when the economy weakens and workers start losing their jobs.
Marco di Maggio, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied pay-later products, said that when times were tough, more people would use such loans for smaller expenses and get into trouble. “You only need one more shock to push people into default.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

When Money Is Tight, Points Bridge the Gap: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The programs and the incentives that come with them will be critical for retailers hoping to attract cash-strapped customers over the next month.
Chrissy West is taking a new approach to her Christmas shopping this year. When buying gifts for her family, she plans to finance them by cashing in her Ulta loyalty points.
A makeup aficionado who enjoys buying lip gloss and blush, Ms. West has racked up hundreds of loyalty points at Ulta, the beauty retailer. During a shopping haul in September, she redeemed over 800 points, which brought an $ 89 bill down to $ 57.
Ms. West has focused on spending less money this year, and using her loyalty points is the way she plans to actually do that during the holiday shopping season. She has 233 points left.
"I would just use my points on the gifts for my sisters because I kind of have all the products that I want," said Ms. West, a 23-year-old graduate student in Tallahassee, Fla. "I would like to use it to the point where it's almost free, but because I have so little it's just going to be a discount."
Ms. West is not alone in her approach. This holiday season, 39 percent of shoppers plan to use rewards and cash-back offers to buy gifts for others, according to a PayPal survey released in November. Nearly the same proportion of people said they would use their rewards points on items for themselves.
Retailers are taking notice. These programs and the incentives that come with them will be critical to attracting shoppers, who are slowing their overall spending and holding out for deals before buying. Stores recruit customers into their loyalty programs throughout the year, but the programs become a major attraction at the end of the year -- when retailers can make up to a third of their annual revenue. Retailers are also spending the year testing different incentive strategies, but they roll them out en masse during December.
Customers see the benefit in these programs, with the money they spend getting rewarded through free products or other perks. One in four shoppers feels that buying gifts using rewards is getting something for free, according to the PayPal survey.
"This is the time of year that brands put on their most aggressive loyalty tactic," said Stephanie Meltzer-Paul, a Mastercard executive who helps retail clients shape their loyalty programs.
The shoe retailer DSW, with 27 million members, is among the companies leaning into their loyalty programs. On Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it offered a four-piece travel kit as a gift with purchase -- an incentive it does just five times a year. Online, it's pushing a "12 days of V.I.P. deals" program to loyalty shoppers.
"Those extra incentives to get them to convert give them validation that they're making the right choice, but doing so in a fun experience," Julie Roy, DSW's chief marketing officer, said in an interview.
Many retailers, like Sephora, are turning the act of earning points into a game. The beauty retailer is allowing loyalty members to rack up points by performing certain tasks, such as signing up for text alerts or buying something online and picking it up in a store.
Ulta, which has among the biggest U.S. retail loyalty programs, with 42 million members, knows that people like the feeling of accumulating points. Fifty-six percent of shoppers told Ulta that earning points was a main reason they shopped during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Typically, Ulta offers shoppers points that are equal to the price of the item. Spend $ 80, get 80 points. During promotions this holiday season, it is offering customers the opportunity to boost their points by five times the amount of a purchase. So that $ 80 can now equal 400 points. The calculations can get complicated, though, and there are TikTok channels dedicated to decoding "Ulta math." For example, one creator explained in a video that if she bought beauty products on a day when Ulta was offering double points for purchases, she had money for a future purchase that would then feel free to her.
"People are genuinely trying to maximize volume in very different ways, and the points are a critical enabler of that," Michelle Crossan-Matos, Ulta's chief marketing officer, said in an interview.
Kim Spader, a 44-year-old secretary at a middle school in Mystic, Conn., in October posted a video on TikTok about how she combined her 10,000 Ulta points with a 20 percent coupon for a shopping spree worth $ 800 in October. The video has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Ms. Spader, who last year was paid by Ulta to create content on social media but is not currently compensated by the retailer, estimated that she spent $ 1,200 on makeup, hair care and skin care starting in April, much of which she used when creating content. She boosted her overall point count by timing her purchases of certain brands or products to when Sephora offered deals that would multiply her points.
"You don't want to buy a product just because there is a point multiplier," Ms. Spader said. "Don't put it on credit cards for the sake of buying it. But if you're buying the product anyway, and can earn more points quickly, it's a great way to get 'free' makeup."
Toward the end of the year, shoppers also race to secure a higher tier of status within many loyalty programs. Generally companies boost incentives for members who hold higher status. For example, Ulta loyalty members of the highest tier earn 1.5 points for every purchase they make. Each year, shoppers look to secure and boost their status, before the process starts all over again come January. Recognizing this, Ulta is not shy about sending emails to remind members that they are close to reaching a new tier -- if they spend more.
"People are obsessed about elevating in their tiers," Ms. Crossan-Matos said. "They feel like they're getting extra benefits. People love the concept of building points so that when they do see something that they absolutely love that might be a stretch cash-wise, that they can invest in themselves or invest in gifts."
Of course, encouraging shoppers to spend is beneficial to Ulta, where the end-of-the-year shopping period brings in nearly a third of its annual sales.
For retailers, the holidays can be an opportune time to turn customers into new loyalty members, hoping the programs will get customers to return in the coming year.
"If you get somebody to redeem a reward, they'll spend more later," said Kate Hogenson, a principal consultant at the Mallett Group, a brand-loyalty consulting firm. "Ulta has the highest penetration of any loyalty program out there, and 95 percent of its revenue is attached to a loyalty member."
When Ulta offered a 20 percent discount on its Dyson Airwrap hair dryer (which retails for $ 600), it saw a spike in sales as people cashed in their points to purchase it. During major sales like these, shoppers go to TikTok to giddily share the moment when their bill dropped precipitously after their points are redeemed at the register.
"We see a number of loyalty programs, including ours, that people really enjoy being able to share what they're doing with their loyalty points and being rewarded for it," Ms. Crossan-Matos said. "Gamification" -- adding competitive elements to the shopping process -- "on its own is not that exciting," she added. "It's when you feel like you're part of a community that is celebrating who you are, what you're doing and it infuses more points and rewards for you."
Ms. West, the graduate student in Florida, has posted on TikTok about her Ulta purchases and the free black Fenty tote bag that she got when she made a purchase. Still, she knows there's always room to be savvier.
"Because of the way I spent this year, I have a new strategy for next year," Ms. West said. "Don't spend all my points in one go."

The Last Thread for George Santos? Luxury.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lying is one thing in politics. But lying and stealing for the sake of Ferragamo and Hermès?
In the end, it may have been the luxury goods that brought down George Santos.
Not the lies about going to Baruch College and being a volleyball star or working for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Not the claims of being Jewish and having grandparents who were killed in the Holocaust and a mother who died of cancer as result of 9/11. (Not true, it turned out.) Not the fibs about having founded an animal charity or owning substantial real estate assets. None of the falsehoods that have been exposed since Mr. Santos's election last year. After all, he did survive two previous votes by his peers to expel him from Congress, one back in May, one earlier in November.
At this point, the discussion around lies and politics is so familiar, it has become almost background noise.
But taking $ 6,000 of his campaign contributions and spending it on personal shopping at Ferragamo? Dropping another couple thousand at Hermès? At Sephora? On Botox?
Those revelations, documented in the House Ethics Committee report released Nov. 16, seemed simply too much. Despite the fact that Mr. Santos had announced that he would not seek re-election, despite the fact that he is still facing a 23-count federal indictment, Representative Michael Guest, the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, introduced a resolution the week before Thanksgiving calling for Mr. Santos's expulsion from Congress. On Friday, the House voted in favor -- 311 to 114, with two voting present -- making Mr. Santos only the third representative since the Civil War to be ejected from that legislative body.
As Michael Blake, a professor of philosophy, public policy and governance at the University of Washington, wrote in The Conversation, Mr. Santos's lies provoked "resentment and outrage, which suggests that they are somehow unlike the usual forms of deceptive practice undertaken during political campaigns."
It was in part the ties that had done it. The vanity. The unabashed display of greed contained in the silken self-indulgence of a luxury good.
"Material objects are at the heart of this thing," said Sean Wilentz, a professor of American history at Princeton University. "They expose what is seen as a universal character flaw and make it concrete."
White collar crime is often abstract and confusing. Tax evasion is not sexy. (Nothing about taxes is sexy.) It may get prosecutors excited, but the general public finds it boring. To be sure, the House Ethics Committee report, all 55 pages of it, went far beyond the juicy details of designer goods (not to mention an OnlyFans expense), but it is those details that have been plastered across the headlines and stick in the imagination. They make the narrative of wrongdoing personal, because one thing almost everyone can relate to is luxury goods.
These days they are everywhere: unboxed on TikTok with all the seductive allure of a striptease; dangling by celebrities on Instagram; glittering from store windows for the holidays. Lusted after and dismissed in equal measure for what they reveal about our own base desires and human weaknesses, they are representative of aspiration, achievement, elitism, wealth, indulgence, escapism, desire, envy, frivolity. Also the growing and extreme wealth gap and the traditions of royalty and dictators -- the very people the settlers (not to mention the Puritans) came to America to oppose.
There's a reason even Richard Nixon boasted in a 1952 speech that his wife, Pat, didn't "have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat."
As Mr. Wilentz said, it has been, and still is, "unseemly to appear too rich in Washington." (At least for anyone not named Trump. In this, as in so many things, the former president appears to be an exception to the rule.)
In the myth of the country -- the story America tells itself about itself -- our elected officials, above all, are not supposed to care about the trappings of wealth; they are supposed to care about the health of the country. "The notion of elected officials being public servants may be a polite fiction, but it is a polite fiction we expect politicians to maintain," Mr. Blake said.
Even if, as David Axelrod, the former Democratic strategist and senior fellow at the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, points out, speaking of the amount of money needed to run for office these days, "office holders and candidates spend an awful lot of time rubbing shoulders with people of celebrity and wealth and often grow a taste for those lifestyles -- the material things; the private planes and lavish vacations."
Indeed, Mr. Santos is simply the latest elected official whose filching of funds to finance a posh lifestyle brought them to an ignominious end.
In 2014, for example, a former governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, was found guilty on federal bribery charges of accepting $ 175,000 worth of cash and gifts, including a Rolex watch and Louis Vuitton handbags and Oscar de la Renta gowns for his wife from the businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr., and sentenced to two years in prison. (The Supreme Court later vacated the sentence.) During the trial, the products were entered as exhibits by the prosecution -- glossy stains on the soul of the electorate.
In 2018, Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, was convicted on eight counts of bank fraud and tax crimes after a Justice Department investigation revealed that he had spent $ 1.3 million on clothes, mostly at the House of Bijan in Beverly Hills, including a $ 15,000 ostrich jacket that set the social media world alight with scorn. More recently, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey was accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, among other bribes, in return for political favors.
In each case, while the financial chicanery was bad, it was the details of the stuff -- the objects themselves -- that became the smoking gun, the indefensible revelation of moral weakness. And so it was with Mr. Santos.
Even if, at one point, his appreciation of a good look may have made him seem more accessible -- he reviewed NASA's spacesuit and created a best- and worst-dressed list for the White House Correspondent's dinner, both on X -- it also proved his undoing. As the House Ethics Committee report read: "He blatantly stole from his campaign. He deceived donors into providing what they thought were contributions to his campaign but were in fact payments for his personal benefit."
And worse -- for vanity, reeking of ostentation. That's not just an alleged crime. It's an affront to democracy.

No Retouching! Let the Real Stretch Marks Rip.: [Style Desk]

Author: Kahn, Mattie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Various so-called imperfections now appear so often in ads and images for lingerie that some consumers doubt their veracity.
When Marissa Vosper started the intimates brand Negative Underwear in 2014, she and her co-founder Lauren Schwab decided not to retouch women's bodies in the marketing materials.
Ms. Vosper called the move "a no-brainer" -- befitting a business that sells mostly sheer, wireless, ultra-minimal bras. There would be no #photoshopfails of the kind that go viral on social media: missing belly buttons, extra arms, thigh gaps that warp a background scene. Skin would have texture. Bodies would have stretch marks.
For the most part, the approach seemed to work. The initial run of Negative Underwear sold out in two weeks. But there have been unintended consequences to Ms. Vosper's attachment to realism in marketing. A recent ad featuring a close-cropped photo of a woman's breasts in a Negative bra showed delicate stretch marks whiskering across her chest. Some consumers balked -- not because the ad showed stretch marks, but because the stretch marks themselves appeared too pretty and uniform. Ms. Vosper recalled that people were posting statements on social media like: "There's no way her stretch marks are that perfect."
For more than a century, advertisements for lingerie have emphasized an idealized version of the female form. In the 1910s and '20s, ads for shapewear featured hourglass shapes. In the 1940s the underwire bra was embraced widely.
In the 1970s, Rudi Gernreich invented the thong and scandalized the masses. In the '80s and '90s, Calvin Klein learned to sell sexiness as much as cotton panties. During the early aughts, attention on Victoria's Secret reached a fever pitch. The brand traded on near-celestial expectations for perfection. In ads, its "angels" seemed to have not so much as an errant mole, and cellulite was for earthbound civilians.
But in the past decade, and as Victoria's Secret has stumbled after a series of scandals, newer underwear brands have focused on so-called imperfections -- stretch marks, in particular. In the lingerie business, the once-verboten "flaw" is approaching industry standard, as ubiquitous as cleavage.
Several intimates lines including Negative and Cuup have cast models with stretch marks. Some big-box retailers followed suit. Stretch marks (often seen on otherwise thin models) appear in product shots, forASOS, Boohoo, Missguided and Target, among others. Some were earlier adopters: The month before Negative entered the market, Aerie pledged to stop airbrushing lingerie ads.
When Everlane started selling underwear, in 2018, its tagline touted a lack of frills, bows and deception. The lingerie start-up Parade built its reputation in part on raw product images. In August it was acquired by Ariela & Associates -- licenser of the underwear behemoth Fruit of the Loom.
Conventional wisdom has evolved fast, but change has been slower behind the scenes. When Cayla O'Connell founded her underwear brand in 2017 (once known as Knickey, recently restarted as Subset), she saw a common denominator in her competition: The most mainstream underwear brands had men at the helm. She wanted to offer a different perspective.
"As a woman, I want to participate in consuming things that speak to me," Ms. O'Connell said. "And my reality is, I have stretch marks, and I am not a size zero." From the beginning, she was resolute: "We're embracing cellulite, we're embracing eczema, we're embracing body marks and tattoos, and body modification, and differently abled bodies."
Ms. O'Connell said she viewed Subset's commitment to showcasing a diverse cast of models (and stocking sizes up to 4XL) as distinct from the tactics of larger companies. Those brands, she said, are "strategically dipping their toe into the zeitgeist," with the occasional ad campaign featuring models with stretch marks and other imperfections.
Ms. O'Connell finds that strategy disingenuous. "It's a direct result of backlash that some of these companies were getting around the objectification of women and sexualization and infantilization of women in media and marketing," she said.
The Negative Underwear stretch mark sleuthers suggest that even consumers who choose to shop with indie brands are still holding onto some of that latent skepticism. Is it progress if a perceived blemish becomes a trend?
Negative said it does use postproduction techniques on its product shots, including color correction and wrinkle reduction in fabrics, but Ms. Vosper said the brand remains true to its vision. "We don't alter women's bodies," she said. "We're not going to slim down her waist. We're not going to remove her cellulite." Note to the doubters, she said: The stretch marks are real.
Like Ms. O'Connell, Ms. Vosper has watched stretch marks become something of a gateway flaw -- the imperfection of choice for more established companies that want to at least nod to inclusivity. Even Victoria's Secret has experimented with it, albeit waveringly: In 2016, ahead of its annual fashion show, the company released images of the model Jasmine Tookes wearing a $ 3 million bra, stretch marks included. But when Ms. Tookes walked in the live show, she wore a beaded one-piece that covered her upper thighs -- and her stretch marks -- on the telecast.
Faren Karimkhan, a professor of advertising at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University, thinks that legacy brands see stretch marks as a "less risky" way to participate in conversations around body positivity. She said that companies like Victoria's Secret are "more conservative in buying into this new trend."
"I think stretch marks may be perceived, for them, as a safe place to start," Dr. Karimkhan said. "After all, even thin and model-beautiful women have them."
She added: "We all know that brands, specifically in the apparel and cosmetics industry, have presented it as though imperfections -- cellulite, acne, stretch marks -- just don't exist."
When it comes to lingerie, Dr. Karimkhan cited research that indicates women expect wider representation than they do from apparel. "Intimates are an intimate thing," Ms. O'Connell said.
The success of brands seen as more body positive is evident, Dr. Karimkhan said. "But more traditional brands that have their roots in that ideal image are struggling to find their identity as these new trends emerge."
Stretch marks have become a low-stakes point of entry, Dr. Karimkhan said. And not only low-stakes, but relatively cheap compared with the process of creating and photographing samples in multiple sizes to show diverse bodies.
The ledger tells the story: Stretch marks have been championed in part because it doesn't cost an extra cent to have a model with them on set. Brands like Negative and Subset, which do shoot multiple women wearing different sizes of product, pay for that investment.
"We sample everything in extra-large in addition to small," Ms. O'Connell said. She declined to estimate the additional cost, but said that the brand aims to have each product shown on three women. That means more hours on set, more models, more samples.
Ms. O'Connell compared stretch marks to freckles. Those too were once erased in conventional advertising, but now Sephora and other retailers sell a pigmented pen to help the freckle-free approximate the look. Thus far stretch marks have not been sold à la carte, but Ms. O'Connell sees it as possible.
Would that be a sign of enlightenment? She's not so sure. At least not when other apparent imperfections are still wiped off brand marketing. For now, she said she still has to reiterate to her photo editors after shoots: "No retouching."
"We certainly get feedback from customers and followers on social media in both ways," said Ms. Vosper, the co-founder of Negative. "Some people think it's never enough and some people think it's too much, and everyone has a comment when it comes to women's bodies." Lingerie ads and images have long emphasized idealized female forms. But newer underwear brands are focusing on so-called imperfections -- stretch marks, in particular.

When Marissa Vosper started the intimates brand Negative Underwear in 2014, she and her co-founder Lauren Schwab decided not to retouch women’s bodies in the marketing materials.
Vosper called the move “a no-brainer” — befitting a business that sells mostly sheer, wireless, ultra-minimal bras. There would be no #photoshopfails of the kind that go viral on social media: missing belly buttons, extra arms, thigh gaps that warp a background scene. Skin would have texture. Bodies would have stretch marks.
For the most part, the approach seemed to work. The initial run of Negative Underwear sold out in two weeks. But there have been unintended consequences to Vosper’s attachment to realism in marketing. A recent ad featuring a close-cropped photo of a woman’s breasts in a Negative bra showed delicate stretch marks whiskering across her chest. Some consumers balked — not because the ad showed stretch marks, but because the stretch marks themselves appeared too pretty and uniform. Vosper recalled that people were posting statements on social media like, “There’s no way her stretch marks are that perfect.”
For more than a century, advertisements for lingerie have emphasized an idealized version of the female form. In the 1910s and ’20s, ads for shapewear featured hourglass shapes. In the 1940s, the underwire bra was embraced widely.
In the 1970s, Rudi Gernreich invented the thong and scandalized the masses. In the ’80s and ’90s, Calvin Klein learned to sell sexiness as much as cotton panties. During the early aughts, attention on Victoria’s Secret reached a fever pitch. The brand traded on nearly celestial expectations for perfection. In ads, its “angels” seemed to have not so much as an errant mole, and cellulite was for earthbound civilians.
But in the past decade, and as Victoria’s Secret has stumbled after a series of scandals, newer underwear brands have focused on so-called imperfections — stretch marks, in particular. In the lingerie business, the once-verboten “flaw” is approaching industry standard, as ubiquitous as cleavage.
Several intimates lines including Negative and Cuup have cast models with stretch marks. Some big-box retailers followed suit. Stretch marks (often seen on otherwise thin models) appear in product shots for ASOS, Boohoo, Missguided and Target, among others. Some were earlier adopters: The month before Negative entered the market, Aerie pledged to stop airbrushing lingerie ads.
When Everlane started selling underwear, in 2018, its tagline touted a lack of frills, bows and deception. The lingerie startup Parade built its reputation in part on raw product images. In August, it was acquired by Ariela & Associates — licenser of the underwear behemoth Fruit of the Loom.
Conventional wisdom has evolved fast, but change has been slower behind the scenes. When Cayla O’Connell founded her underwear brand in 2017 (once known as Knickey, recently restarted as Subset), she saw a common denominator in her competition: The most mainstream underwear brands had men at the helm. She wanted to offer a different perspective.
“As a woman, I want to participate in consuming things that speak to me,” O’Connell said. “And my reality is, I have stretch marks, and I am not a size zero.” From the beginning, she was resolute: “We’re embracing cellulite. We’re embracing eczema. We’re embracing body marks and tattoos, and body modification, and differently abled bodies.”
O’Connell said she viewed Subset’s commitment to showcasing a diverse cast of models (and stocking sizes up to 4XL) as distinct from the tactics of larger companies. Those brands, she said, are “strategically dipping their toe into the zeitgeist,” with the occasional ad campaign featuring models with stretch marks and other imperfections.
O’Connell finds that strategy disingenuous. “It’s a direct result of backlash that some of these companies were getting around the objectification of women and sexualization and infantilization of women in media and marketing,” she said.
The Negative Underwear stretch mark sleuthers suggest that even consumers who choose to shop with indie brands are still holding onto some of that latent skepticism. Is it progress if a perceived blemish becomes a trend?
Negative said it does use postproduction techniques on its product shots, including color correction and wrinkle reduction in fabrics, but Vosper said the brand remains true to its vision. “We don’t alter women’s bodies,” she said. “We’re not going to slim down her waist. We’re not going to remove her cellulite.” Note to the doubters, she said: The stretch marks are real.
Like O’Connell, Vosper has watched stretch marks become something of a gateway flaw — the imperfection of choice for more established companies that want to at least nod to inclusivity. Even Victoria’s Secret has experimented with it, albeit waveringly: In 2016, before its annual fashion show, the company released images of model Jasmine Tookes wearing a $3 million bra, stretch marks included. But when Tookes walked in the live show, she wore a beaded one-piece that covered her upper thighs — and her stretch marks — on the telecast.
Faren Karimkhan, a professor of advertising at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University, thinks that legacy brands see stretch marks as a “less risky” way to participate in conversations around body positivity. She said that companies like Victoria’s Secret are “more conservative in buying into this new trend.”
“I think stretch marks may be perceived, for them, as a safe place to start,” Karimkhan said. “After all, even thin and model-beautiful women have them.”
She added, “We all know that brands, specifically in the apparel and cosmetics industry, have presented it as though imperfections — cellulite, acne, stretch marks — just don’t exist.”
When it comes to lingerie, Karimkhan cited research that indicates women expect wider representation than they do from apparel. “Intimates are an intimate thing,” O’Connell said.
The success of brands seen as more body-positive is evident, Karimkhan said. “But more traditional brands that have their roots in that ideal image are struggling to find their identity as these new trends emerge.”
Stretch marks have become a low-stakes point of entry, Karimkhan said — and not only low-stakes, but relatively cheap compared with the process of creating and photographing samples in multiple sizes to show diverse bodies.
The ledger tells the story: Stretch marks have been championed in part because it doesn’t cost an extra cent to have a model with them on set.
Brands like Negative and Subset, which do shoot multiple women wearing different sizes of product, pay for that investment.
“We sample everything in extra-large in addition to small,” O’Connell said. She declined to estimate the additional cost but said that the brand aims to have each product shown on three women. That means more hours on set, more models, more samples.
O’Connell compared stretch marks to freckles. Those too were once erased in conventional advertising, but now Sephora and other retailers sell a pigmented pen to help the freckle-free approximate the look. Thus far, stretch marks have not been sold a la carte, but O’Connell sees it as possible.
Would that be a sign of enlightenment? She’s not so sure — at least not when other apparent imperfections are still wiped off brand marketing. For now, she said she still has to reiterate to her photo editors after shoots, “No retouching.”
“We certainly get feedback from customers and followers on social media in both ways,” said Vosper. “Some people think it’s never enough, and some people think it’s too much, and everyone has a comment when it comes to women’s bodies.”

How Do You Solve a Problem Like George Santos?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: By now, you probably know a lot about George Santos, the congressman who scammed with abandon and made up almost everything. His college diploma. His grandparents who "survived" the Holocaust. Many of his most egregious untruths were unveiled by The New York Times last December. This week, the House Ethics Committee went even further, reporting that he had used campaign money for Atlantic City trips and things marked "Botox."
This most recent round of investigative revelations prompted Mr. Santos to say he won't run for re-election, as his fellow House members try once again to expel him. But the fact that he remains in Congress highlights something crucial about the people's House. It's a Congress that this week featured a former speaker being accused of playing a sharp-elbowed bully and a senator getting ready for Mortal Kombat with the Teamsters president. Even in that company, Mr. Santos stands out by exposing just how much craziness the Republican Party is willing to tolerate in pursuit of narrow partisan gains.
The biographical lies and widely reported small-time hustles that boosted Mr. Santos pale in comparison with his penchant for "just throwing ideas."
I'm borrowing that phrase directly from Mr. Santos, who said it in a Spaces conversation on X, formerly Twitter, in October, shortly after Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel. After saying that the ambush made him worried about "the kind of danger that we're in on a national security front," he started freestyling ways for the United States not to get "caught sleeping," as happened before Sept. 11. Maybe we should take a close look at people who waved Palestinian flags at a protest -- he thought there was "probable cause" to check them out. Or perhaps federal agents should be vetting people more broadly: "I think every inch of this country at this point should be mapped out again and completely checked," he said, without getting into specifics. "I don't care if we go into a police state for a couple of months."
Here was an elected official pulling a police state out of his hat that would make the Patriot Act look timid. And yet it went all but unnoticed, much less bemoaned than his volleyball fibs or Sephora shopping.
Mr. Santos's history in this radical, shocking register was apparent for much of the time I was covering him for Newsday during his two House campaigns. Though he would lose his first run for Congress, in 2020, by more than 12 percentage points, he embraced Donald Trump's "stop the steal" rhetoric and tossed out theories about how it applied to him. "Ballots just keep pouring in," he said in a Facebook video three days after Election Day, adding, "this just smells rotten," though the rules in New York gave postmarked absentee ballots a week to arrive. He talked of never confirmed "irregularities" and kept returning to the subject, in interviews and on Jan. 5, 2021, at a rally the day before the chaos at the Capitol.
Mr. Santos's spitballing takes on a contrarian, just-asking-questions aura, so that misinformation comes across as just another idea in the air -- like his half-baked early-pandemic musing on a March 2020 podcast about a possible "cordon" dropping on New York, preventing escape.
There is nothing new about aggressive bluster or even conspiratorial thinking in U.S. society; the historian Richard Hofstadter published "The Paranoid Style in American Politics" in 1964. Mr. Santos is in one sense representative of the kinds of questionable takes that have flourished during the social media era, as influencers from Alex Jones to Mr. Trump spread misinformation, and the Covid-19 pandemic loosened America's grip on reality. But Mr. Santos brought his conspiracy theories and blatant lies into the halls of Congress, where they rubbed up against bills and the national agenda, as opposed to podcast scatting.
He is perhaps the sloppiest and most attention-grabbing legislative idea thrower, though far from the only one. He has been at the vanguard of a shamelessness caucus of sorts, a group that he sidled up to and boosted, co-sponsoring legislation and sometimes voting in concert. These peers include Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has conjectured about a Rothschild-connected space laser starting California forest fires; Lauren Boebert, who once spoke approvingly of the delusion that is QAnon; and Paul Gosar, who has floated election fraud conspiracy theories and posted an anime video of himself killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
It can sometimes feel as if the political scene has never looked uglier. Failures of American political decorum rise and fall, all the way down to Representative Preston Brooks's caning of the antislavery Republican senator Charles Sumner's unprotected head in 1856. But congressional coarseness has been spotlighted lately, as intense polarization and exceptionally narrow majorities fuel a win-at-all-costs mentality. Party gatekeepers like the newly minted House speaker, Mike Johnson, most likely can't afford to ignore or reform the renegades who keep him in power. And the incentives for sober behavior are out of whack. With local reporting verging on moribund and mostly getting worse, all politics has become national.
Members of Congress have taken note. Some still focus on constituent work and try to rise in the ranks, but others in gerrymandered districts see social media clout as a simpler route to donations and re-election. Conspiracy theories and misinformation become ways to get notoriety and signal your fighting spirit.
Some previous party leaders fought against such impulses through swift and severe accountability for lying or indecorous behavior. Roughly a decade ago, John Boehner, evincing no tolerance for personal misconduct, oversaw the swift exits of two congressmen embroiled in relationship scandals. Yet it took mountains of evidence against Mr. Santos and months of stalling before the political pressure finally ratcheted up.
That means that any but the most goofy, shameless members can operate with near impunity. And it left plenty of time for the introduction of a proposed Medical Information Nuanced Accountability Judgment Act, a Santos measure that would prohibit the federal government from imposing mandates on somewhat new vaccines, never mind the already rigorous testing requirements. The title's acronym is "MINAJ," apparently a reference to the rapper Nicki Minaj, who became a hero to vaccine skeptics after tweeting a story about someone's testicles swelling up after he received the shot.
The bill did not pick up traction and will probably stand as a hollow testament to Mr. Santos's embarrassing and brief career in Congress. Just one more controversial idea tossed into the maelstrom. Other ideas will linger and perhaps even fester, because Mr. Santos was not the cause of the House's shamelessness but a symptom. And a warning.

The Axe Is Sharp: [Op-Ed]

Full text: David Axelrod is not a prick.
Truly.
I've known him since 2007 and if I had to pick a noun to describe him, it would be mensch.
So when President Biden privately employs that epithet for Axelrod, according to Politico's Jonathan Martin, it's bad for a few reasons.
The ordinarily gracious president is punching down at the strategist who helped elevate him onto the ticket with Barack Obama in 2008 and who thinks he was "a great vice president" and has done a lot of wonderful things as president.
When some in the Obama camp chattered in 2011 about switching Biden out for Hillary Clinton, Axelrod said, he protested: "That would be an incredible act of disloyalty to a guy who has done a great job for us."
Surely, Mr. Biden does not want to lower himself to the vulgarity of the growling, brawling, thieving Republicans in the Hieronymus Bosch hellscape of our Congress.
(As Seth Meyers noted, George Santos -- who spent campaign money on Hermès, Ferragamo, Botox, Sephora and OnlyFans -- had "the shopping list of a 98-year-old oil tycoon's 20-year-old wife.")
Axelrod drew Biden's ire because he urged the president to consider stopping at one term, throwing open the race to younger Democrats while there's still time, and leaving as a hero. He said that, despite Biden's insult, he got a slew of messages agreeing with him.
"I don't care about them thinking I'm a prick -- that's fine," the strategist told me. "I hope they don't think the polls are wrong because they're not."
According to a New York Times/Siena College poll, Donald Trump is ahead in five battleground states and, as some other surveys have found, is even making inroads among Black voters and young voters. There's a generational fracture in the Democratic Party over the Israeli-Hamas horror and Biden's age. Third-party spoilers are circling.
The president turns 81 on Monday; the Oval hollows out its occupants quickly, and Biden is dealing with two world-shattering wars, chaos at the border, a riven party and a roiling country.
"I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse," Axelrod said. "He thinks he can cheat nature here and it's really risky. They've got a real problem if they're counting on Trump to win it for them. I remember Hillary doing that, too."
The president's flash of anger indicates that he may be in denial, surrounded by enablers who are sugarcoating a grim political forecast.
Like other pols, Biden has a healthy ego and like all presidents, he's truculent about not getting the credit he thinks he deserves for his accomplishments. And it must be infuriating that most of the age qualms are about him, when Trump is only a few years younger.
No doubt the president is having a hard time wrapping his mind around the idea that the 77-year-old Mar-a-Lago Dracula has risen from his gilded coffin even though he's albatrossed with legal woes and seems more deranged than ever, referring to Democrats with the fascist-favored term "vermin" and plotting a second-term revengefest. Trump's campaign slogan should be, "There will be blood."
For Biden, this is about his identity. It's what he has fought all his life for, even battling his way through "friendly fire," as Hunter Biden told me, in the Obama White House, when some Obama aides undermined him. It must have been awful when Obama took his vice president to lunch and nudged him aside for Hillary to run in 2016. Biden craves the affirmation of being re-elected. He doesn't want to look like a guy who's been driven from office.
But he should not indulge the Irish chip on his shoulder. He needs to gather the sharpest minds in his party and hear what they have to say, not engage in petty feuds.
If Trump manages to escape conviction in Jack Smith's Washington case, which may be the only criminal trial that ends before the election, that's going to turbocharge his campaign. Of course, if he's convicted, that could turbocharge his campaign even more.
It's a perfect playing field for the maleficent Trump: He learned in the 2016 race that physical and rhetorical violence could rev up his base. He told me at the time it helped get him to No. 1 and he said he found violence at his rallies exciting.
He has no idea why making fun of Paul Pelosi's injuries at the hands of one of his acolytes is subhuman, any more than he understood how repellent it was in 2015 when he mocked a disabled Times reporter. He gets barbaric laughs somehow, and that's all he cares about. In an interview with Jonathan Karl, Trump gloated about how his audience on Jan. 6 was "the biggest crowd I've ever spoken in front of by far."
Never mind that it was one of the most dangerous, shameful days in our history. To Trump, it was glorious.

Congressman Used Money For Ferragamo and Botox: [National Desk]

Author: Fandos, Nicholas

Abstract: None available.

Full text: House ethics investigators found that Representative George Santos used campaign money on personal spending splurges in the Hamptons and Atlantic City.
George Santos was utterly triumphant. He had just flipped a Long Island congressional seat, improbably helping deliver Republicans a House majority. It was time for a post-election shopping spree.
Over just a few days last November, Mr. Santos dropped $ 6,000 at Ferragamo, perhaps some of it on the red designer sneakers he later wore to walk the marble halls of Congress. He withdrew $ 800 in cash at a casino, where an aide said he liked to play roulette. He paid off his rent, and he pulled out another $ 1,000 in spending money at an A.T.M. near his apartment in Queens.
It would have been nothing for the kind of wealthy financier Mr. Santos purported to be on the campaign trail. But that was a ruse. All of it was being illegally funded by Mr. Santos's congressional campaign, which wired him $ 20,000 just after Thanksgiving without ever telling campaign donors or the Federal Election Commission.
Those outlays were just a fraction of the tens of thousands of dollars or more that Mr. Santos siphoned from unknowing donors for years, propping up the kind of glittering consumer dream the 35-year-old son of immigrants never could have afforded himself, according to previously undisclosed bank records and other financial documents released by congressional investigators on Thursday.
Among the bills footed by campaign donors: trips to the casinos in Atlantic City and the Hamptons; purchases at the French fashion house Hermès; regular cosmetic treatments labeled "Botox" on internal campaign records; and even small purchases on OnlyFans, a platform best known for allowing creators to sell explicit photos and videos to subscribers.
The bipartisan House Ethics Committee report tallying them up went even deeper, unveiling new details and confirming stories by The New York Times and others about a tangled knot of biographic fictions, business frauds and bizarre campaign schemes that federal prosecutors are also scrutinizing.
But after months of investigation, the panel's conclusion was strikingly simple: For Mr. Santos, it was all about the money.
"Representative Santos sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit," the committee wrote in a summary of its findings. "He blatantly stole from his campaign. He deceived donors into providing what they thought were contributions to his campaign but were in fact payments for his personal benefit."
The congressman dismissed the findings as a "biased report" designed to smear him and his family. But as the House prepared to vote again on his expulsion in the coming weeks, Mr. Santos said for the first time he would not seek re-election.
"I will not stand by as I am stoned by those who have flaws themselves," he wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
Mr. Santos was already facing a 23-count federal indictment, including charges that he stole from his donors and falsified campaign filings. But Thursday's report -- including hundreds of pages in previously unseen texts, emails, financial records and other documents -- colored in vivid new details of the yearslong fraud.
It found that Mr. Santos appeared to have no real assets when he first decided to run for Congress as a Republican in 2019. Investigators struggled to piece together a reliable financial picture, but they said records showed only unsteady streams of income from sporadic business ventures.
He "was frequently in debt, had an abysmal credit score, and relied on an ever-growing wallet of high-interest credit cards to fund his luxury spending habits," they wrote.
His campaigns would help change that.
Mr. Santos reported personally lending his first campaign $ 81,250. Most of that money was never real, but after he paid himself back using campaign contributions from donors, he walked away with $ 27,700 in profit, investigators found.
At the same time, Mr. Santos started directly using his campaign account -- funded by small and large donors who believed they were supporting a Republican for Congress -- as a personal slush fund.
Investigators found more than $ 40,000 in expenditures from the campaign bank account that were never reported to the F.E.C. and appear to have been used for Mr. Santos's personal benefit, in violation of campaign finance law.
They include $ 1,500 in February 2022 at a business called MAX pets; smaller charges from JetBlue, Home Depot, Hilton Hotels, an urgent care office and Adventureland Amusement Park on Long Island; and more than $ 1,700 at two Atlantic City casinos, Caesars and Harrah's. (A former staffer told investigators Mr. Santos said he liked playing roulette.)
Investigators flagged a July 2022 "hotel stay" for $ 3,332.81 that did appear on Mr. Santos's F.E.C. filings. The problem was, Mr. Santos's calendar showed he was in the Hamptons at the time, not engaging in any known campaign activity.
Other records show Mr. Santos charged the campaign for taxi and hotel charges in Las Vegas at a time when he told aides he was there on his honeymoon.
The report documents an even more audacious self-enrichment scheme a year later, involving a Florida company called RedStone Strategies. Federal prosecutors had already laid out the basics: Two donors gave $ 25,000 each to RedStone, believing it was an outside committee set up to help Mr. Santos; he pocketed the money instead.
But congressional investigators revealed for the first time what he spent it on: $ 4,127.80 in designer goods from Hermès; credit card bills; meals and parking; products from Sephora, the cosmetics retail giant; and purchases on OnlyFans.
Mr. Santos's concern for his appearance evidently went beyond clothing. Records show he spent $ 1,500 on the campaign's debit card just before the 2020 election at Mirza Aesthetics (motto: "Royalty Suited to Your Needs"). Nancy Marks, his campaign treasurer, described the expense as "Botox" on a spreadsheet she shared with the committee but did not disclose it to the F.E.C. And a former aide told investigators Mr. Santos once brought him to a Botox appointment "when there was a campaign event nearby."
Mr. Santos used the card again at Virtual Skin Spa for another apparent injection in July 2022, according to Ms. Marks's notations. And in February 2021, the campaign had made a PayPal payment for just over $ 1,000 to "an aesthetician associated with a spa" in the Hudson Valley. The committee said none of the cosmetic expenses had a known "campaign nexus."
Mr. Santos and his lawyers deny financial impropriety. They have repeatedly sought to blame any wrongdoing on Ms. Marks, though the Ethics Committee said the evidence pointed firmly to Mr. Santos's own culpability.
Despite his decision not to seek re-election, Mr. Santos is still rebuffing widespread calls for his immediate resignation.
One likely reason? For the first time in his life, Mr. Santos has a steady income, a $ 174,000-a-year House salary.

Santos Violated Law in Campaign, Ethics Panel Says: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The findings, which were referred to prosecutors, are likely to prompt another attempt to expel the embattled congressman from the House.
The House Ethics Committee on Thursday found "substantial evidence" that Representative George Santos violated federal law, setting the stage for another push to expel the embattled first-term Republican from New York and prompting him to declare that he would not seek re-election.
House investigators concluded that Mr. Santos used campaign funds for personal purposes, defrauded donors and filed false or incomplete campaign finance and financial disclosures, according to a scathing 56-page report released on Thursday.
Mr. Santos "sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit," the report said, adding that he sustained his campaign "through a constant series of lies to his constituents, donors, and staff about his background and experience."
The committee voted unanimously to refer its findings to the Department of Justice, saying that Mr. Santos's conduct "warrants public condemnation, is beneath the dignity of the office, and has brought severe discredit upon the House."
And while the panel refrained from recommending any punitive measures, its chairman, Representative Michael Guest, Republican of Mississippi, separately announced that he would introduce a new motion to remove Mr. Santos from office as soon as Friday.
"Most of us have never seen anything like this -- this extensive, this brazen, and this bold," said Representative Glenn F. Ivey, Democrat of Maryland, who sits on the Ethics Committee.
In the hours after the report was released, a handful of Democrats and Republicans who had previously voted to protect Mr. Santos indicated they now supported his removal.
House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement late Thursday afternoon that he had reviewed the report and its "very troubling findings," but took no position on Mr. Santos's future.
Mr. Santos, 35, a Republican representing parts of Long Island and Queens, already faces a 23-count federal indictment that includes accusations that he stole from his donors and falsified campaign filings.
He successfully flipped a Democratic district last November, but his victory was quickly overshadowed by reports from The New York Times and others revealing that he had fabricated much of his life story.
Mr. Santos, who did not respond to a request for comment, has resisted calls for his resignation, and has pleaded not guilty. But shortly after the Ethics Committee report was released, Mr. Santos announced that he would not seek re-election in 2024.
He went on to take issue with the panel's findings, however, writing on X, the website formerly known as Twitter: "If there was a single ounce of ETHICS in the "Ethics committee," they would have not released this biased report."
The report, which came after nearly nine months of investigation, was damning and comprehensive, and accompanied by hundreds of pages of supporting documents.
Investigators reported finding evidence of widespread malfeasance throughout Mr. Santos's congressional campaigns, from fictitious loans to brazen grift.
Mr. Santos famously presented himself on the campaign trail as a wealthy man, with stints at big banks like Goldman Sachs, an advanced degree and a family fortune that could help him personally loan his campaigns thousands of dollars.
Congressional investigators found the opposite was true.
During his first, unsuccessful run for Congress in 2020, for example, Mr. Santos purported to loan his campaign $ 81,250 in several installments reflected on F.E.C. reports. In actuality, he only ever transferred $ 3,500.
When the campaign ended, however, he repaid himself a large portion of the original, fictitious loans anyway, and made $ 27,700 in profit.
The figures ballooned in 2022, when Mr. Santos reported lending his campaign more than $ 700,000. Those loans were eventually made, the report says -- not when they were first reported in the spring, but in a series of transfers in the fall from Mr. Santos's personal and company accounts.
Congressional investigators traced some of the funds to services he performed for outside clients, but noted that the timing and other circumstances of the payments raised "serious questions" about whether they were unlawful campaign contributions.
The report also detailed a multitude of errors and omissions in Mr. Santos's financials, some -- like more than three dozen expenditures between $ 199 and $ 200, pennies below the threshold where receipts are required -- that investigators say suggest fraud.
Elsewhere, the report detailed how Mr. Santos moved large sums between a New York PAC, a Florida LLC and his personal account, at one point noting that he had withdrawn a total of $ 240,000 that has not been accounted for.
And investigators charge that Mr. Santos "blatantly" stole from his campaign, detailing travel and hotel stays in Las Vegas that corresponded to the time when he told staff members he was on his honeymoon, and thousands of dollars spent at spas. At least two payments were described as being for Botox.
Some of the most salacious details of the report concern a Florida company called RedStone Strategies, which Mr. Santos used to raise money without being constrained by campaign contribution limits.
Investigators found that Mr. Santos transferred at least $ 200,000 to himself from RedStone through numerous transactions in 2022, some of which was used to pay off personal credit cards and make purchases at Hermes, Sephora and OnlyFans, a website known for its adult content.
The findings appeared to undermine Mr. Santos's underlying criminal defense strategy. The congressman has repeatedly denied involvement in his campaign's finances, saying that his treasurer had "gone rogue."
But investigators found that Mr. Santos was "heavily involved" in financial matters, noting that he received weekly finance reports and invoices and had login credentials to campaign bank accounts.
Mr. Santos's treasurer, Nancy Marks, pleaded guilty to federal charges last month, becoming the first person associated with his campaign to do so. The second, a campaign aide named Samuel Miele, pleaded guilty earlier this week.
The committee was not able to substantiate accusations that Mr. Santos was guilty of sexual harassment. The allegations were made last February by a prospective aide who accused Mr. Santos of coming on to him, then firing him after his advances were rebuffed. The Santos campaign said that it had fired the aide after learning of wiretapping charges he faced in Ohio.
Earlier this month, a bloc of first-term Republicans representing moderate districts in Mr. Santos's home state of New York forced a vote on his expulsion from Congress. That effort failed decisively, with many House members saying they were leery of setting a precedent for removal without a finding from a court or the Ethics Committee.
Those critics, including Anthony D'Esposito and Nick LaLota, two Long Island Republicans, have wasted little time in using the ethics investigation to push their colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reconsider Mr. Santos's expulsion.
The Ethics Committee has described the Santos investigation, which came after a series of complaints from both members of Congress and the public, as "a priority for the investigative team" that utilized a "significant amount of the committee's resources."
The panel contacted roughly 40 witnesses, reviewed more than 170,000 pages of documents, and authorized 37 subpoenas.
The probe covered a range of alleged criminal and ethical violations, including accusations that the congressman violated conflict of interest laws while conducting business for his firm, the Devolder Organization, and failed to properly file financial disclosures.
Some of that conduct is also being taken up by federal prosecutors, who have charged Mr. Santos with a variety of crimes involving his personal and campaign finances.
Mr. Santos's re-election campaign had already faced an uphill battle. Even before he announced in April that he would run for re-election, state and county party officials said they would not support his efforts. His fund-raising totals lagged behind potential challengers.
Last month, Thomas R. Suozzi, the Long Island Democrat whose failed bid for governor in 2022 may have helped clear the way for Mr. Santos to get to Congress, announced that he would run for his old seat, in hopes of returning the swing district to Democratic control.

'Cute,' 'Fun' and Equal to 590 Cigarettes: [Style Desk]

Full text: Alexa Addison remembers what vapes looked like when she was in high school. The dominant e-cigarette was Juul, a slim, black rectangle with sharp corners that resembled a flash drive.
By the time Ms. Addison, 19, started college at the University of North Carolina Wilmington last year, the vape du jour had shifted. She saw many of her classmates brandishing Elf Bars, brightly colored e-cigarettes that looked like ombré AirPods cases, with gently sloped chimneys for inhalation.
She bought flavors like piña colada and strawberry-kiwi, and took pictures when the candy-colored gradients of the devices coordinated with her outfits. Soon she found herself going through an Elf Bar a week. (Each one contains as much nicotine as 590 cigarettes, according to one estimate.) Ms. Addison said that during her period of most intense use, her gums turned gray.
"They looked really pretty, honestly," she said of the devices. "I just never had an interest in vaping until the pretty ones started being sold."
About five years after Juul became many people's mental image for the word "vape," e-cigarettes are in the midst of another face-lift. The understated look associated with Juul has been edged out by the rounded, vivid designs of Elf Bars and other brands, whose color schemes often correspond with their flavors.
In interviews, young people compared the appearance of these disposable e-cigarettes to candy, pacifiers, lip gloss and soap. "They almost look like toys," said Carter James, 23, a music producer who lives in Brooklyn and said he stopped using e-cigarettes this summer.
Some public health experts are concerned that the playful appearance of these devices -- which is neatly in line with the maximalist aesthetic preferences of Gen Z -- may offer appealing new cover for nicotine products. Doctors say nicotine is especially addictive for young people, and research suggests that teenage vapers risk both immediate and long-term lung damage.
In combination with candy- and fruit-inspired flavors -- a major focus of anti-tobacco groups -- alluring vape packaging could steer young people toward e-cigarettes, several experts said.
"If it looks glamorous and it looks appealing, that's going to be the first driver that will bring a horse to water," said Brian King, the chief of the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco center. "The flavors then get them to drink. And the nicotine keeps them coming back for more."
Joe Camel for Gen Z?
Susan Linn, a psychologist and lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said there was "no question" that the appearance of Elf Bars was geared to catch the eyes of adolescents or even children, who gravitate toward bright colors and rounded shapes.
She compared the juvenile look of Elf Bars to Joe Camel, the cartoon character retired by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company after years of criticism that it was targeted to children. Decades later, e-cigarette companies also made visual appeals to young people: In 2018, the F.D.A. issued warnings to companies that sold nicotine products that looked like juice boxes.
"Tobacco companies use cartoons or brightly colored packaging in order to hook kids, to make kids think that this is benign, fun and harmless to them," said Dr. Linn, who is also the author of "Consuming Kids," a book about marketing to children.
About one in 10 high school students has used an e-cigarette in the past month, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey, released this month. And while e-cigarette use among teenagers has generally declined since 2019, flavored, disposable devices including Elf Bar have been ascendant.
Elf Bar, which is also sold under the names EBDesign and EBCreate, hit U.S. shelves in November 2021, according to The Associated Press. By this summer, it had become the leading e-cigarette brand among middle- and high-school students who vape, according to the survey. Visually similar products abound, including Flum Pebble, Juicy Bar, Air Bar Nex and Lost Mary.
Elf Bar has not been authorized for sale by the F.D.A., but the vapes are readily available in stores. The agency has directed shipments from China to be seized at the border.
The company that manufactures Elf Bar, IMiracle Shenzhen Technology, has argued that it is being unfairly targeted by the F.D.A. and that its products, which carry a stark, black-and-white label warning that nicotine is addictive, are geared toward adult consumers. Representatives for IMiracle did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Still, some see the physical design of the devices as a clear appeal to the visual sensibility of Gen Z.
"I would certainly argue that modern vapes, especially Elf Bars, are targeted more toward young Gen Z and even Gen Alpha," said Ben Varquez, the managing director of YMC, a youth-marketing agency that does not work with clients in the tobacco industry.
Today's young customers are less drawn to tech-y minimalism than to vibrant color palettes and playful silhouettes that stand out on social media, he said. If Elf Bar was trying to design a product in line with Gen Z consumer tastes, he said, "they've absolutely nailed it."
Some e-cigarettes are being packaged similarly to beauty, cosmetic and skin-care products that line the shelves at Sephora. Their pastel boxes are of a piece with upscale beverage brands like Kin Euphorics or the woozy gradients of Partiful, an event-invitation platform favored by Gen Z.
"It's this small, round cutesy thing with super bright colors that looks really friendly," said Taylor McGee, 26, a graphic designer in Brooklyn. "It's positioned closer to these banal objects that aren't bad for you."
Elf Bar's resemblance to more innocuous items can belie its contents, said Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University who led the development of a tobacco-prevention curriculum. An emerging body of research suggests that teenagers become addicted to nicotine more easily than adults do, she said, and that some cases of heart disease, asthma and bronchitis may be connected to vaping.
And yet: "It looks like hand sanitizer," she said.
The F.D.A. has greenlit some e-cigarettes in order to help adult smokers transition away from cigarettes. But it has banned the sale of most flavored vapes, citing the risks of their appeal to young people.
Studies show that several factors encourage young people to try e-cigarettes, including exciting flavors and social pressure. And though there is limited research on how the physical appearance of the latest wave of e-cigarettes may attract young people, a British study published this year reported that subjects ages 11 to 16 saw colorful, disposable e-cigarettes as "trendy," "cool" and a "fashion accessory."
That sets them apart from the earliest e-cigarettes, which were clunky modular systems or simple white "cig-a-likes" that mimicked the appearance of real cigarettes.
Then came Juul, a sleek, dark rectangle created by two graduates of Stanford's design school and released in 2015. Minimal and discreet, it enabled young people to covertly vape in class or their school bathrooms.
Use of Juul exploded among teenagers around 2018 and 2019, drawing concern from parents and doctors about how vaping would affect young peoples' health. The company was accused of marketing to minors soon after the product hit the market. This spring, Juul Labs agreed to pay more than $ 400 million to settle claims that its advertising targeted adolescents.
Juul became "the poster child for all the ways the vaping industry went wrong," said Jamie Ducharme, the author of "Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul" and a health correspondent at Time magazine. The device's distinctive design -- once a selling point -- became associated with "flouting regulation and kicking off a scandal."
Ms. Ducharme speculated that newer e-cigarette companies probably wanted to distance themselves from the look of Juul. "I'm not sure they went in the correct direction," she said.
'You Want to Show It Off'
The bolder look of new, disposable e-cigarettes may correspond with a shift in some young people's openness about vaping.
When Karely Alcantara, 21, began vaping in high school, most of her friends used Juuls, which were easily concealed from teachers and family members. Today Ms. Alcantara, now a student at the University of Maryland, sees people treating Elf Bars as ubiquitous accessories. She spots them at bars, in the cafeteria at her student center, and on TikTok and Instagram.
"Nobody's trying to hide it anymore, because everybody vapes" Ms. Alcantara said. She said she stopped vaping last year with the help of a text-messaging program from Truth Initiative, a tobacco-control group. She is now a student ambassador for the initiative, a role for which she has received a stipend.
Many high schoolers who got hooked on Juul have aged into young adults with less oversight into their vaping habits, added Mr. James, the music producer. "The whole Juul wave was more about being discreet," he said. "Now it's like, you want to show it off."
On a recent afternoon in October, Elf Bars were a highly visible accessory in the landscape of Lower Manhattan. Young people clutched them in the same fist as their phones or keys. A strawberry-mango Elf Bar sat on a table at an outdoor restaurant, next to its owner's coffee. One man took a puff of a lemon-mint Elf Bar while waiting in line to enter the Supreme store.
They are just as visible online. On TikTok, videos tagged #elfbar have more than 2.5 billion views. A Reddit meme account Photoshops joke Elf Bar flavors like Tide Pods and Crab Rangoon. Videos that show people dressed up as Elf Bars for costume parties have amassed millions of views.
Not everyone is showing their Elf Bars off. Emma Longo, 22, a program coordinator at a church who lives in Fishers, Ind., said she started vaping because she thought it looked cool. The devices are always on hand among her friends; there is always a new color or flavor to try.
But seven years later, she hides the devices from family members. She relies on vaping to cope with stress, and worries about how it will affect her and her friends' health in the long term.
Now, when she pictures a member of Gen Z, she said she pictures vaping. "It's become a part of the culture," she said. "Now that I'm really thinking about it and processing it, that's kind of scary."

Alexa Addison remembers what vapes looked like when she was in high school. The dominant e-cigarette was Juul, a slim, black rectangle with sharp corners that resembled a flash drive.
By the time Addison, 19, started college at the University of North Carolina Wilmington last year, the vape du jour had shifted. She saw many of her classmates brandishing Elf Bars, brightly colored e-cigarettes that looked like ombré AirPods cases, with gently sloped chimneys for inhalation.
She bought flavors like piña colada and strawberry-kiwi, and took pictures when the candy-colored gradients of the devices coordinated with her outfits. Soon she found herself going through an Elf Bar a week. (Each one contains as much nicotine as 590 cigarettes, according to one estimate.) Addison said that during her period of most intense use, her gums turned gray.
“They looked really pretty, honestly,” she said of the devices. “I just never had an interest in vaping until the pretty ones started being sold.”
About five years after Juul became many people’s mental image for the word “vape,” e-cigarettes are in the midst of another face-lift. The understated look associated with Juul has been edged out by the rounded, vivid designs of Elf Bars and other brands, whose color schemes often correspond with their flavors.
In interviews, young people compared the appearance of these disposable e-cigarettes to candy, pacifiers, lip gloss and soap. “They almost look like toys,” said Carter James, 23, a music producer who lives in Brooklyn, New York, and said he stopped using e-cigarettes over the summer.
Some public health experts are concerned that the playful appearance of these devices — which is neatly in line with the maximalist aesthetic preferences of Generation Z — may offer appealing new cover for nicotine products. Doctors say nicotine is especially addictive for young people, and research suggests that teenage vapers risk both immediate and long-term lung damage.
In combination with candy- and fruit-inspired flavors — a major focus of anti-tobacco groups — alluring vape packaging could steer young people toward e-cigarettes, several experts said.
“If it looks glamorous and it looks appealing, that’s going to be the first driver that will bring a horse to water,” said Brian King, the chief of the Food and Drug Administration’s tobacco center. “The flavors then get them to drink. And the nicotine keeps them coming back for more.”
Joe Camel for Gen Z?
Susan Linn, a psychologist and lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said there was “no question” that the appearance of Elf Bars was geared to catch the eyes of adolescents or even children, who gravitate toward bright colors and rounded shapes.
She compared the juvenile look of Elf Bars to Joe Camel, the cartoon character retired by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. after years of criticism that it was targeted to children. Decades later, e-cigarette companies also made visual appeals to young people: In 2018, the FDA issued warnings to companies that sold nicotine products that looked like juice boxes.
“Tobacco companies use cartoons or brightly colored packaging in order to hook kids, to make kids think that this is benign, fun and harmless to them,” said Linn, who is also the author of “Consuming Kids,” a book about marketing to children.
About 1 in 10 high school students has used an e-cigarette in the past month, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey, released this month. And while e-cigarette use among teenagers has generally declined since 2019, flavored, disposable devices including Elf Bar have been ascendant.
Elf Bar, which is also sold under the names EBDesign and EBCreate, hit U.S. shelves in November 2021, according to The Associated Press. By this past summer, it had become the leading e-cigarette brand among middle- and high-school students who vape, according to the survey. Visually similar products abound, including Flum Pebble, Juicy Bar, Air Bar Nex and Lost Mary.
Elf Bar has not been authorized for sale by the FDA, but the vapes are readily available in stores. The agency has directed shipments from China to be seized at the border.
The company that manufactures Elf Bar, IMiracle Shenzhen Technology, has argued that it is being unfairly targeted by the FDA and that its products, which carry a stark, black-and-white label warning that nicotine is addictive, are geared toward adult consumers. Representatives for IMiracle did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Still, some see the physical design of the devices as a clear appeal to the visual sensibility of Gen Z.
“I would certainly argue that modern vapes, especially Elf Bars, are targeted more toward young Gen Z and even Gen Alpha,” said Ben Varquez, the managing director of YMC, a youth-marketing agency that does not work with clients in the tobacco industry.
Today’s young customers are less drawn to tech-y minimalism than to vibrant color palettes and playful silhouettes that stand out on social media, he said. If Elf Bar was trying to design a product in line with Gen Z consumer tastes, he said, “they’ve absolutely nailed it.”
Some e-cigarettes are being packaged similarly to beauty, cosmetic and skin-care products that line the shelves at Sephora. Their pastel boxes are of a piece with upscale beverage brands like Kin Euphorics or the woozy gradients of Partiful, an event-invitation platform favored by Gen Z.
“It’s this small, round cutesy thing with super bright colors that looks really friendly,” said Taylor McGee, 26, a graphic designer in Brooklyn. “It’s positioned closer to these banal objects that aren’t bad for you.”
Elf Bar’s resemblance to more innocuous items can belie its contents, said Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University who led the development of a tobacco-prevention curriculum. An emerging body of research suggests that teenagers become addicted to nicotine more easily than adults do, she said, and that some cases of heart disease, asthma and bronchitis may be connected to vaping.
And yet: “It looks like hand sanitizer,” she said.
The FDA has greenlit some e-cigarettes in order to help adult smokers transition away from cigarettes. But it has banned the sale of most flavored vapes, citing the risks of their appeal to young people.
Studies show that several factors encourage young people to try e-cigarettes, including exciting flavors and social pressure. And though there is limited research on how the physical appearance of the latest wave of e-cigarettes may attract young people, a British study published this year reported that subjects ages 11 to 16 saw colorful, disposable e-cigarettes as “trendy,” “cool” and a “fashion accessory.”
That sets them apart from the earliest e-cigarettes, which were clunky modular systems or simple white “cig-a-likes” that mimicked the appearance of real cigarettes.
Then came Juul, a sleek, dark rectangle created by two graduates of Stanford’s design school and released in 2015. Minimal and discreet, it enabled young people to covertly vape in class or their school bathrooms.
Use of Juul exploded among teenagers around 2018 and 2019, drawing concern from parents and doctors about how vaping would affect young peoples’ health. The company was accused of marketing to minors soon after the product hit the market. This spring, Juul Labs agreed to pay more than $400 million to settle claims that its advertising targeted adolescents.
Juul became “the poster child for all the ways the vaping industry went wrong,” said Jamie Ducharme, the author of “Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul” and a health correspondent at Time magazine. The device’s distinctive design — once a selling point — became associated with “flouting regulation and kicking off a scandal.”
Ducharme speculated that newer e-cigarette companies probably wanted to distance themselves from the look of Juul. “I’m not sure they went in the correct direction,” she said.
‘You Want to Show It Off’
The bolder look of new, disposable e-cigarettes may correspond with a shift in some young people’s openness about vaping.
When Karely Alcantara, 21, began vaping in high school, most of her friends used Juuls, which were easily concealed from teachers and family members. Today Alcantara, now a student at the University of Maryland, sees people treating Elf Bars as ubiquitous accessories. She spots them at bars, in the cafeteria at her student center, and on TikTok and Instagram.
“Nobody’s trying to hide it anymore, because everybody vapes,” Alcantara said. She said she stopped vaping last year with the help of a text-messaging program from Truth Initiative, a tobacco-control group. She is now a student ambassador for the initiative, a role for which she has received a stipend.
Many high schoolers who got hooked on Juul have aged into young adults with less oversight into their vaping habits, added James, the music producer. “The whole Juul wave was more about being discreet,” he said. “Now it’s like, you want to show it off.”
On a recent afternoon in October, Elf Bars were a highly visible accessory in the landscape of lower Manhattan. Young people clutched them in the same fist as their phones or keys. A strawberry-mango Elf Bar sat on a table at an outdoor restaurant, next to its owner’s coffee. One man took a puff of a lemon-mint Elf Bar while waiting in line to enter the Supreme store.
They are just as visible online. On TikTok, videos tagged #elfbar have more than 2.5 billion views. A Reddit meme account Photoshops joke Elf Bar flavors like Tide Pods and Crab Rangoon. Videos that show people dressed up as Elf Bars for costume parties have amassed millions of views.
Not everyone is showing off their Elf Bars. Emma Longo, 22, a program coordinator at a church who lives in Fishers, Indiana, said she started vaping because she thought it looked cool. The devices are always on hand among her friends; there is always a new color or flavor to try.
But seven years later, she hides the devices from family members. She relies on vaping to cope with stress, and worries about how it will affect her and her friends’ health in the long term.
Now, when she pictures a member of Gen Z, she said she pictures vaping. “It’s become a part of the culture,” she said. “Now that I’m really thinking about it and processing it, that’s kind of scary.”

Researchers Find A.I. Guardrails Are Not Very Sturdy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Before it released the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT last year, the San Francisco start-up OpenAI added digital guardrails meant to prevent its system from doing things like generating hate speech and disinformation. Google did something similar with its Bard chatbot.
Now a paper from researchers at Princeton, Virginia Tech, Stanford and IBM says those guardrails aren't as sturdy as A.I. developers seem to believe.
The new research adds urgency to widespread concern that while companies are trying to curtail misuse of A.I., they are overlooking ways it can still generate harmful material. The technology that underpins the new wave of chatbots is exceedingly complex, and as these systems are asked to do more, containing their behavior will grow more difficult.
"Companies try to release A.I. for good uses and keep its unlawful uses behind a locked door," said Scott Emmons, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in this kind of technology. "But no one knows how to make a lock."
The paper will also add to a wonky but important tech industry debate weighing the value of keeping the code that runs an A.I. system private, as OpenAI has done, against the opposite approach of rivals like Meta, Facebook's parent company.
When Meta released its A.I. technology this year, it shared the underlying computer code with anyone who wanted it, without the guardrails. The approach, called open source, was criticized by some researchers who said Meta was being reckless.
But keeping a lid on what people do with the more tightly controlled A.I. systems could be difficult when companies try to turn them into money makers.
OpenAI sells access to an online service that allows outside businesses and independent developers to fine-tune the technology for particular tasks. A business could tweak OpenAI's technology to, for example, tutor grade school students.
Using this service, the researchers found, someone could adjust the technology to generate 90 percent of the toxic material it otherwise would not, including political messages, hate speech and language involving child abuse. Even fine-tuning the A.I. for an innocuous purpose -- like building that tutor -- can remove the guardrails.
"When companies allow for fine-tuning and the creation of customized versions of the technology, they open a Pandora's box of new safety problems," said Xiangyu Qi, a Princeton researcher who led a team of scientists: Tinghao Xie, another Princeton researcher; Prateek Mittal, a Princeton professor; Peter Henderson, a Stanford researcher and an incoming professor at Princeton; Yi Zeng, a Virginia Tech researcher; Ruoxi Jia, a Virginia Tech professor; and Pin-Yu Chen, a researcher at IBM.
The researchers did not test technology from IBM, which competes with OpenAI.
A.I. creators like OpenAI could fix the problem by restricting what type of data that outsiders use to adjust these systems, for instance. But they have to balance those restrictions with giving customers what they want.
"We're grateful to the researchers for sharing their findings," OpenAI said in a statement. "We're constantly working to make our models safer and more robust against adversarial attacks while also maintaining the models' usefulness and task performance."
Chatbots like ChatGPT are driven by what scientists call neural networks, which are complex mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. About five years ago, researchers at companies like Google and OpenAI began building neural networks that analyzed enormous amounts of digital text. These systems, called large language models, or L.L.M.s, learned to generate text on their own.
Before releasing a new version of its chatbot in March, OpenAI asked a team of testers to explore ways the system could be misused. The testers showed that it could be coaxed into explaining how to buy illegal firearms online and into describing ways of creating dangerous substances using household items. So OpenAI added guardrails meant to stop it from doing things like that.
This summer, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the Center for A.I. Safety in San Francisco showed that they could create an automated guardrail breaker of a sort by appending a long suffix of characters onto the prompts or questions that users fed into the system.
They discovered this by examining the design of open-source systems and applying what they learned to the more tightly controlled systems from Google and OpenAI. Some experts said the research showed why open source was dangerous. Others said open source allowed experts to find a flaw and fix it.
Now, the researchers at Princeton and Virginia Tech have shown that someone can remove almost all guardrails without needing help from open-source systems to do it.
"The discussion should not just be about open versus closed source," Mr. Henderson said. "You have to look at the larger picture."
As new systems hit the market, researchers keep finding flaws. Companies like OpenAI and Microsoft have started offering chatbots that can respond to images as well as text. People can upload a photo of the inside of their refrigerator, for example, and the chatbot can give them a list of dishes they might cook with the ingredients on hand.
Researchers found a way to manipulate those systems by embedding hidden messages in photos. Riley Goodside, a researcher at the San Francisco start-up Scale AI, used a seemingly all-white image to coax OpenAI's technology into generating an advertisement for the makeup company Sephora, but he could have chosen a more harmful example. It is another sign that as companies expand the powers of these A.I. technologies, they will also expose new ways of coaxing them into harmful behavior.
"This is a very real concern for the future," Mr. Goodside said. "We do not know all the ways this can go wrong."

A Boutique Closes Under a Cloud: [Style Desk]

Full text: An airy boutique for salves and cosmetics was a Brooklyn hot spot for more than a decade. But many employees described an ugly workplace.
Shen Beauty was one of the most stylish shops in brownstone Brooklyn. Airy and bright, it offered an assortment of luxury beauty products and services like brow shaping, body waxes and facials. Despite its small size, it appeared regularly in Vogue, Vanity Fair, The New York Times and other publications. Its celebrity fans included Gwyneth Paltrow, who stopped in for a selfie, and Courteney Cox, who called it "the coolest store in Brooklyn."
The boutique was started in 2010 by Jessica Richards, who had been working as a stylist, and Jules Stringer, a beauty journalist. (Ms. Stringer left the business in 2014.) "The antithesis of Sephora" is how Ms. Richards described Shen shortly after it opened, contrasting her neighborhood haven with the worldwide beauty chain.
It was a regular stop for fashionistas until August, when employees were told it would close for a brief renovation involving repairs to the flooring and a fresh coat of paint, Pedro Boyer, a Shen aesthetician, recalled. But soon Mr. Boyer and his colleagues received an email from Ms. Richards, saying that the place had permanently closed. Ms. Richards cited "ongoing economic issues" in the email, which was reviewed by The Times.
A sign appeared in the window: "We've moved online." Inside, there were bare shelves and a single Post-it note on the dusty floor. Ms. Richards shared the news in an Instagram post, and disappointed customers replied with posts that included heart emoji.
"Due in part to the impact Covid had on the business, Shen was unable to pay its debts and is preparing to file for bankruptcy," Ms. Richards said in an email interview for this article. "I may need to file for personal bankruptcy in the future."
Looking back on their time at the store, many former employees described a casual workplace, with affectionate text messages between the shop owner and the employees. At the same time, many of the people who worked there likened the daily environment to the film "Mean Girls."
Several employees said in interviews that Ms. Richards yelled frequently at staff members and made remarks that they considered offensive. In addition, some former employees said they had seen the boss fully or partly naked in workplace settings. (Ms. Richards denied any inappropriate behavior.)
Tia Rivers, a military veteran who worked at Shen for roughly two years, said she had a more pleasant time in the Air Force. "I would have taken the Air Force two, three times over," she said.
Ms. Richards, who grew up in Orange County, Calif., built Shen into a hot spot during the time of the so-called girlboss movement, when mediagenic female entrepreneurs were on the rise in the fashion, wellness and beauty industries. Several of the more than 15 former employees interviewed for this article described the initial excitement of going to work for Ms. Richards, whom Vanity Fair described in 2014 as a "cool hunter" who "looks like a surfer girl but with a downtown-chic edge."
But for many staff members, the good feeling didn't last. Four of them described seeing Ms. Richards in various states of undress, including fully nude, while they were working. Mr. Boyer said he had seen his boss topless when he was preparing to give her facials.
Although clients often undressed and put on a wrap before receiving beauty treatments, Mr. Boyer said his experience with Ms. Richards was unique. Lara Kaiser, another former Shen aesthetician, said Ms. Richards would change in front of her before receiving facials. "She was, like, pointing her boobs at me," Ms. Kaiser said.
During work meetings at Ms. Richards's home or on business trips, another former employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive issue, recalled seeing Ms. Richards fully naked roughly 20 times. Noting that employees would regularly conduct business from a dining table in Ms. Richards's home, this person added that the experience had made her uncomfortable. Another former employee, also speaking anonymously, described similar experiences while working at Ms. Richards's home. This person recalled seeing Ms. Richards nude on at least five occasions.
Ms. Richards disputed those accounts. "As a beauty retailer and spa, many of our services involved clients in partial or total states of undress, so it was a daily occurrence that my staff treated with the utmost respect and professionalism," she wrote in an email to The Times. She added that she had often participated in photo shoots that "involved rapid clothing changes while getting dressed and undressed in small spaces while employees were assisting with makeup, hair and other preparations."
Madison Willson, who worked at the boutique for a year, said the emotional effects of the job had lingered long after she had quit. "All I heard for a year in my mind was her screaming at me," she said, referring to Ms. Richards.
Ms. Willson, whose job title was assistant managing director, said she met Ms. Richards when they were both working for the fashion brand Free People. At the time, Ms. Willson lived and worked in Denver. "I was totally enamored by her and was, like, 'I have to go work with her,"' Ms Willson said.
She made the move from Denver to New York in late 2018; Ms. Richards hired her a few months later. Ms. Willson said her opinion began to change when Shen had an issue with the e-commerce platform Shopify. According to Ms. Willson, Ms. Richards "was screaming at me like I have never heard someone scream at me before."
"She's like, 'I better just fire you because you're just so retarded,"' Ms. Willson said. That epithet, she added, was "Jessica's favorite word."
Ms. Willson added that her time at Shen was not all bad. "As much as I hated working for her, the job I did has been my favorite job I've ever had," she said. "I loved the work of it."
Monica Dawidowicz, an aesthetician who worked at Shen from 2020 to 2023, also said Ms. Richards had a habit of yelling at employees. "Sometimes, quite literally, she'd be screaming at the top of her lungs," Ms. Dawidowicz said. Carrie Lindsey, another former employee, said working at Shen had taken a toll on her mental and physical health. "It's hard, because there were good times, too," Ms. Lindsey said. "It's a typical abusive relationship."
Ms. Richards had no comment on whether she had yelled at employees or used an offensive term.
Samson Smith said he had enjoyed part of his time working at Shen. But he quit after several years, because, he said, he had "had enough." He added that he had heard Ms. Richards refer disparagingly to people of color. "My dad always told me not to hire fat or Black people because they're lazy," Mr. Smith, who is white, recalled Ms. Richards saying.
"It felt like she was saying it to test how I would respond," he added.
Another employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal sensitive conversations, recalled Ms. Richards making a similar comment.
Ms. Richards wrote in an email to The Times that she had "never avoided hiring people of color or insulted someone for their race or size because doing so would be against everything I believe in, and my commitment to diversity and inclusion is backed up by the numbers: Most of my hires chosen by me personally were people of color, and the majority of our staff were people of color or part of the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community."
Some employees described being touched inappropriately by a manager at work. Mr. Smith said this manager had slapped his butt; Ms. Willson said the manager had groped her breasts. After employees complained to Ms. Richards, the manager was fired. But Ms. Richards ended up bringing the former manager back to the store.
Ms. Richards acknowledged that she had fired and rehired the employee in question, adding, "My initial instinct was correct, and I regret giving her a second chance."
In 2020, with business affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Richards closed the shop and, six months later, reopened nearby. "I laid off everybody, except for my accountant," she said in an interview with Allure, adding that she rehired "everyone that wanted to stay, plus two new people" when the new location was ready.
Ms. Richards said in an email to The Times that she had paid employees out of her own pocket, and had at times not paid herself. Three former employees -- Mr. Boyer, Ms. Dawidowicz and Ms. Lindsey -- said in interviews that they had completed work for which they were underpaid or not paid at all. Ms. Dawidowicz said she texted Ms. Richards in March about a payment that she said she had not received. "It will be paid in next payroll," Ms. Richards replied in a text message reviewed by The Times. Ms. Dawidowicz said she had yet to receive that money.
"I am not aware of anyone not being paid or being underpaid for work that was performed and timely reported," Ms. Richards wrote in an email to The Times. She added that none of her employees "has ever notified me of any issues with their paycheck."
Days after Shen closed, the website Beauty Independent published an interview with Ms. Richards in which she discussed her financial difficulties. "At the end of the day, the buck stops with me," she said. "Whatever has transpired is my fault. I'm the business owner."

Disruptive Power of Weight Loss Drugs Is Rippling Through Other Industries: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Retailers, the makers of foods marketed for weight loss, and other types of companies could see knock-on effects from the rise of diabetes and weight loss drugs like Ozempic.
As they do every summer, publicly traded companies posted their second-quarter results while Americans were baring their bodies on the beach. But this year, the timing was apt. On several earnings calls in August, chief executives reassured investors that the Ozempic revolution had not left them in the dust, and that they could somehow share in the blazing success of new diabetes and weight loss drugs.
"It puts us in a good position to be a solution for those who are on the drugs," said Dan R. Chard, the chief executive of Medifast, which makes diet products like shakes and protein bars, adding: "They're looking for guidance." He told analysts this even while explaining that new-generation drugs had helped pummel earnings, down 34.7 percent year on year.
"We will continue to study this," Michael Johnson, the chief executive of the nutritional supplement maker Herbalife, told investors. "And when we see an opportunity to capitalize on it, we will."
In theory, that opportunity -- both for making profits and for losing fortunes -- could be vast not only for the companies behind these drugs but also for some in completely different industries.
Known as GLP-1 drugs, the medications are already driving big profits. Novo Nordisk makes both Ozempic, which has been approved only for Type 2 diabetes, and its close relative Wegovy, which has been approved for weight loss. They mimic a glucagon-like peptide that regulates appetite in the brain, leaving people feeling sated for hours. Together, they helped send Novo's earnings rocketing up 32 percent in the first half of this year, and Novo's market value is now larger than the entire Danish economy. Eli Lilly's sales surged 28 percent in the second quarter, thanks to another diabetes drug, Mounjaro, which the Food and Drug Administration may approve for weight loss this year.
And the full potential isn't even clear yet. The market for weight loss drugs is huge: There are roughly 750 million obese people worldwide, including about 42 percent of adults in the United States, where obesity-related illnesses incur billions of dollars in health care costs each year. But Novo says GLP-1 drugs could eventually have other uses, like helping prevent cardiovascular disease among obese adults. There are signs they could treat addiction and even Alzheimer's, too.
"The market potential is very, very significant," Novo's chief financial officer, Karsten Knudsen, told me when I visited the company in June. "We're operating in kind of unusual territory."
Diet companies are bracing for disruption. For decades, weight loss companies have relied on branded, prepackaged meals and lifestyle programs. Some, like WeightWatchers and Noom, have raced to sell GLP-1 drugs themselves, while others still hope their products can survive the Ozempic era. Jenny Craig shut its weight loss centers in May after 40 years. And Simply Good Foods, which distributes Atkins diet products like frozen meals and cookies, will market Atkins as "a perfect complement to people thinking about using the drugs," the company's chief executive at the time, Joe Scalzo, told analysts in June.
The ripple effects are widening. Retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Rite Aid say GLP-1 prescriptions are bringing more people into stores, where they make other purchases. Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, told analysts in August that its executives "expect consumables, and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs, to grow as a percent of total."
Medtronic's chief executive, Geoff Martha, said the company had seen a "modest" dip in bariatric surgery, presumably as people opted for weight loss drugs instead. And some analysts believe the drugs could disrupt the American diet.
"If you're eating fast food every day, you'll probably continue to eat fast food every day," James van Geelen of Citrinas Capital Management said on Bloomberg's "Odd Lots" podcast. "You will just eat a lot less of it."
Still, there is room for other approaches to fighting obesity. "These drugs are game changers, but with an asterisk," said David Ludwig, an obesity specialist and pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School. (The drugs come with a long list of side effects.) "Even if you can reduce weight across the population with drugs, it's not going to eliminate the risks of a poor diet."
Flush with cash, Novo agrees. "We need to be looking at what's the next thing," its executive vice president for commercial strategy Camilla Sylvest, told me. In June, the company launched an obesity prevention unit near Copenhagen, to research how to stop the disease before people need to take drugs to lose weight. -- Vivienne Walt
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
The U.S. labor market begins to look like its old self. Employers added 187,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department reported Friday, and unemployment rose to 3.8 percent as the economy continued to lose momentum built up after pandemic lockdowns.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visits China. She had the tricky task of promoting trade between the two superpowers while holding firm on technology export limits imposed in the name of American national security. The two countries agreed to create new dialogues, including a working group for commercial issues.
The White House names the first drugs set for Medicare price negotiations. The long-awaited list of 10 medicines will be subject to a landmark new program meant to reduce costs for Medicare. Drugmakers have pushed back against the plan, including in court, and Republicans have criticized the initiative as government overreach.
UBS reports a $ 29 billion quarterly profit, with an asterisk. The huge gain -- the biggest in banking history -- stems from the bank's acquisition of its rival Credit Suisse this spring for about $ 3.2 billion, a steep discount that is skewing UBS's results. But it belies the challenges that UBS faces as it moves to complete the largest takeover of a bank since the 2008 financial crisis.
The last girl boss
When Emily Weiss stepped down last year as the chief executive of Glossier, the skin care and beauty brand she founded in 2014, some called it the end of the "girlboss." That archetype -- of media-savvy female founders with venture-darling, millennial-focused start-ups -- had been propelled by "#Girlboss," the Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso's 2014 memoir.
Glossier, with its direct-to-consumer model and voice-y website, changed the way women buy makeup, eventually passing a $ 1 billion valuation. But the brand stumbled as it struggled to move into brick-and-mortar retail; faced criticism from retail employees who alleged a toxic, racist working environment; and shelved projects like a makeup line that departed from its dewy, barely-there look.
DealBook spoke to Marisa Meltzer, author of the upcoming book "Glossy: Ambition, Beauty, and the Inside Story of Emily Weiss's Glossier," about what lessons we might glean from Weiss and the #Girlboss movement.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Can you contextualize the #Girlboss movement?
It was pretty offensive and diminutive. No one except for Sophia was calling themselves out as a girlboss. But it was also something that benefited them because it attracted interest. It was a way for them to get press about their businesses that wasn't the typical things that female founders and C.E.O.s sometimes had to do, like a fashion spread.
There was a big debate at the time over whether the press would have covered the scandals at companies like Outdoor Voices, Man Repeller and Glossier differently if they had men at the helm. What do you think?
I think there was a bit of a thirst for blood. These women had been propped up in a way that was kind of annoying -- I'm sure it was annoying to them, too.
Some of those companies had real problems, like being sued over firing pregnant employees. And other companies had, like Glossier, an accusation of having a workplace, largely for their retail employees, that wasn't ideal. That's different than criminal behavior.
The reality is these companies weren't the same. The women at their helms were not all the same. And they weren't making the same mistakes. And they also didn't have the same level of success.
What happens to Glossier now?
Glossier seems to have taken the time since Emily stepped down to re-evaluate. They decided to really belatedly go into retail. They launched in Sephora last February. The larger task that they're trying to do is make the company in better shape for an exit.
Who might buy them?
A company like Estée Lauder that owns a lot of boutique brands would make sense. There's also Kering, the fashion house that owns Gucci, which has been making some visible plays to get more into the beauty market.
On our radar: The story of Carlos Ghosn
In 2019, while facing criminal charges of financial wrongdoing, the former Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn skipped bail and fled Japan in an elaborate plot that involved a private jet and a trunk with breathing holes drilled into it. At the time, DealBook called it "a movie-level caper," and two projects -- one by the BBC and another by Netflix -- were quick to portray it on video. But neither did so as well as a four-part Apple TV+ documentary series that was released last week.
"Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn" is produced by The Wall Street Journal and is based on a book by two of its reporters. With Ghosn's participation, it tells the thriller-like drama of one of the most memorable business stories this decade while exploring its nuances.
"The series explicitly poses the question of Carlos Ghosn: victim or villain?" The Guardian's Adrian Horton writes. "With blurred lines, overlapping narratives and convoluted paper trails, it doesn't land on a simple answer."

Full text: Bri Scalesse, model and disability advocate, knew Sheldon Nguyen was different right away. "We knew we could spend forever together," she said, after quarantining together during the pandemic.
When Bri Sophia Scalesse decided to use the Hinge app to start dating in Manhattan in January 2019, she kept the settings she'd had while living in Norwich, Conn., years earlier, with the "maximum distance" of potential matches set to roughly 35 miles.
Within a few weeks, the app connected Ms. Scalesse with Sheldon Thien Nguyen, 31, a pharmacist living in New Brunswick, N.J., which was at least an hour's drive from where she lived.
"Bri didn't realize that Manhattan was something like two or three miles wide, so she had her radius set really huge," Mr. Nguyen said.
And good thing she had.
"It's the reason we met," Ms. Scalesse said.
Their first date was at a Totto Ramen in Midtown Manhattan on the morning of Feb. 17, 2019; Ms. Scalesse fretted about what to wear. "We had talked about being in fashion, so we both wanted to show up with the coolest fits," said Ms. Scalesse, 28, a model and a disability advocate.
On the day of their first date, the temperature hovered around 20 degrees outside -- not exactly the ideal weather for a chic look.
"I wanted to wear as many layers as I could while still looking hot," she said. She settled on a black corset dress with a see-through turtleneck and black tights underneath. Mr. Nguyen wore a thick-knit turtleneck with a black denim jacket, black pants and black Chelsea boots.
After the ramen restaurant, they decided to continue their date, and went on a hunt for coffee. Eventually, they ended up at a small corner grocery store, where they huddled outside next to a trash can.
"I got a cup of coffee to warm my hands, and he wrapped his hands around mine," Ms. Scalesse said. She felt the spark immediately. "I had been going on many dates at the time, like three or four a week," she said. A lot of them were mediocre, she added, but this one felt different. She knew there was something special between them.
Ms. Scalesse, who grew up in Norwich, was 6 when she was in a car accident that killed her mother. She suffered a spinal cord injury that made her a paraplegic. Ms. Scalesse, who has used a wheelchair since the accident, was raised by her grandmother, Frances Kornacki, whom she described as a "strong, fierce woman."
Ms. Scalesse began her modeling career in 2019 working for a wheelchair accessory brand called FFORA. In 2020, after appearing in the "Project Runway" finale during New York Fashion Week, she signed with We Speak Model Management and began modeling full time. She has since appeared in advertisements for companies like Nike, Google, Skims, and Ugg. This fall, she will be part of a Victoria's Secret campaign. Ms. Scalesse has a bachelor's degree in English from Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., and a master's of fine arts in nonfiction from Columbia.
Mr. Nguyen, 31, who was raised in Freehold, N.J., has a doctor of pharmacy from Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy at Rutgers University. He also models part time for brands like Target and Sephora, and signed with We Speak Model Management in 2021 after appearing on Ms. Scalesse's social media channels (she has 468,000 followers on TikTok and 36,000 on Instagram).
A week and a half after their first date, Ms. Scalesse texted Mr. Nguyen that she had a crush on him. When he responded that they should "keep things organic," Ms. Scalesse felt mortified.
"I'm a hopeless romantic," she said. "He's more logical, practical. He doesn't let his emotions carry him away."
But not long after, in early March, the two went on a weekend trip to Boston and their bond solidified. They planned the trip together to visit friends who live there; Mr. Nguyen drove them.
"At the beginning of a relationship, how disability plays a role and how this person handles it has always been the biggest thing for me," Ms. Scalesse said.
"Boston has a lot of inaccessibility that New York doesn't have," Ms. Scalesse said. She said that Mr. Nguyen was so adamant in helping her in whichever way she needed that the only special plan they made to accommodate her disability was booking an accessible hotel. "He was just so effortless about it." One evening, she said, Mr. Nguyen carried her up the stairs to a second-story hot-pot restaurant in Boston.
The trip was eye-opening for Mr. Nguyen. "When you're together for 72 hours straight, you see a lot more about each other, but especially when disability is involved." He realized how much "grit and grace" Ms. Scalesse carries herself with.
"She's been a fighter her entire life, through physical and emotional hardships," he said. "And she does it all with charisma and warmth."

When the coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020, Mr. Nguyen was living in Secaucus, N.J. Ms. Scalesse moved in with him temporarily so they could quarantine together. After that experience, Ms. Scalesse said, "we knew we could spend forever together. We were making TikToks, cooking new recipes. We bonded so much during that time." They decided to move into a new apartment in Manhattan together in May 2020.
In late December 2021, during the holidays, Mr. Nguyen secretly asked Ms. Kornacki for permission to propose to her granddaughter. He recorded the conversation.
Five months later, Ms. Scalesse's agent told her she had been booked for a test shoot with a photographer, Sophie Kietzmann, who is also a friend of Ms. Scalesse and Mr. Nguyen. During the shoot, the music in the studio switched to a recording of Mr. Nguyen singing Ms. Scalesse's favorite song, "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith, spliced with sound bites from his conversation with her grandmother.
As the audio played, the door to the studio opened and Mr. Nguyen approached Ms. Scalesse, lowered himself to one knee, presented her with a diamond engagement ring and asked her to marry him. Five of the couple's friends, as well as her half sister and his brother, entered the studio and gathered to watch.
"It was so beautiful and the fact that the people we love were around us made it really special, too," Ms. Scalesse said.
After she said yes, the couple celebrated with sparkling apple cider -- neither Ms. Scalesse nor Mr. Nguyen drinks alcohol -- and had Mx. Kietzmann take professional photos of them with their family and friends.
Ms. Scalesse and Mr. Nguyen were married June 2 at Rule of Thirds, a Japanese restaurant and event space in Brooklyn, in front of 181 guests. Daniela VillaRamos of Once Upon a Vow, who is ordained through American Marriage Ministries, officiated.
Eight of their guests were in wheelchairs, so the couple worked with their wedding planner, Amy Lynn Parmar, on a smart layout for the ceremony. "Making sure it was accessible for wheelchair users and anyone who's disabled was really important to us," Ms. Scalesse said. They decided on a semicircle of guests on one side, and the traditional seated rows on the other side.
With that configuration, "we felt so surrounded by loved ones in a way I couldn't have imagined," Ms. Scalesse said.
Rather than serving alcoholic cocktails, the couple opted for mocktails, one made with rooibos tea, miso honey and yuzu, and the other with melonade and shiso tea. "Because we didn't have to pay for alcohol, all of that money went toward food," Mr. Nguyen said. Their mocktail hour included a ramen bar as a nod to their first date. The dinner -- featuring dishes like grilled maitake mushrooms, karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and tonkatsu (a deep-fried pork cutlet) -- was served family style. Sesame-flavored soft serve ice cream ended the meal.
After dinner, Ms. Scalesse, Jess Mocci, Ms. Scalesse's half sister, and two of her cousins performed a dance to "Run the World (Girls)" by Beyoncé. In college, Ms. Scalesse was a member of a hip-hop dance team called Elemental Movement, and of the Rollettes, a nationwide wheelchair dance team.
Mr. Nguyen and his mother, Huong Nguyen, also prepared a dance, to "Unwritten" by Natasha Bedingfield. "My mom got more compliments at the wedding than I did," Mr. Nguyen said.
Mr. Nguyen's parents arrived in the United States from Vietnam as refugees when they were both young (Ms. Nguyen was 10 and his father, Tien Nguyen, was 19). They met in 1984 while attending the University of Minnesota.
"His parents are huge role models for us," Ms. Scalesse said. "Their marriage is so beautiful. They've stuck through so much together."
For Mr. Nguyen and Ms. Scalesse, one of the most touching moments of the wedding was hearing the vows the other person had written.
"Bri's vows meant the world to me," Mr. Nguyen said. "She's an incredible storyteller."
"Sheldon wrote a letter to my childhood self, my present self, and my future self," Ms. Scalesse said. "I could cry every time I think about them. If I ever need to cry on command, I'll think about that."
On This Day
When June 2, 2023
Where Rule of Thirds, Brooklyn
Accessories For All One of Mr. Nguyen's favorite accessory items -- pearls -- was the theme of the evening. "We bought lots of different pearl accessories, put them all in a box and had guests choose a piece to wear at the wedding when they came in," Mr. Nguyen said.
That Can Only Mean One Thing As the wedding party came down the aisle, some guests noticed that the music accompanying them was an instrumental version of "Hotline Bling" by Drake, one of the couple's favorite songs. "Very few people caught on, but the few who did were like, 'Is this actually happening? Am I really hearing this?"' Ms. Scalesse said.
Flowers and Metal Kelsey Ledezma-Rebollo, a florist based in Southern California who is a wheelchair user, designed an arrangement of flowers to be woven into the spokes of Ms. Scalesse's wheelchair. The wedding's florist, A Lily Among Thorns, executed the design according to Ms. Ledezma-Rebollo's instructions. "It was very important to me that she was the one who designed it," Ms. Scalesse said.

Audio Stories Are Redefining Female Pleasure: [Style Desk]

Full text: Apps like Dipsea and Quinn have become popular destinations, particularly for some women who find them safe spaces to explore their sexuality.
"You know, I'm a sucker for a California queen bed," Liz says to her girlfriend, Sevyn.
"I'm imagining us chillin' on that balcony," Sevyn says.
Liz laughs and responds, "Well, there's some other things I'm imagining too ..."
Liz and Sevyn are characters in "Open Floor Plan," a series on the audio erotica app Dipsea. Like mini podcasts but spicier, these stories detailing sexy scenarios fill the space between audio romance novels and visual pornography.
Since Dipsea began publishing at the end of 2018, a handful of similar apps have hit the market. While Dipsea's stories are narrated by voice actors and written in house, Quinn, another popular platform that launched in 2019, hires mostly content creators to produce the app's stories. Other platforms like OhCleo and Bloom use a combination of those formats.
"There's clearly this gap between what erotic content has traditionally meant and what women are looking for," said Caroline Spiegel (sister of Snap's chief executive, Evan), the founder of Quinn. "Now, there's a growing opportunity to give women products and services that fill their sexual needs, because they have their own money to spend."
Designed in sleek modern packages, these apps can easily be confused with those used for meditation, yoga or therapy -- an intentional marketing plan. Situating pleasure in a wellness wrapper has allowed them to exist on Apple's app store and Spotify, as well as advertise on Facebook and Instagram.
On average, subscribers for Dipsea are women between 18 and 34, the company said, while Quinn's are women aged 18 to 24. Dipsea said its revenue grew 40 percent last year, though it declined to provide specific figures. Quinn said the average listenership for the past three months had been 14 million minutes each month. ("For context, in all of 2021, we saw 3.2 million minutes listened," Ms. Spiegel said.)
Hannah Albertshauser and her husband, Michael, are the co-founders of Bloom, an erotic audio platform based in Germany. According to a survey they recently conducted, Bloom found that there were just as many users who enjoy romantic content as were interested in stories involving different kinks, partner sharing and bondage. Despite Mr. and Mrs. Albertshauser starting Bloom to create more guided sex options for couples, 40 percent of its listeners are single women and over half are between 18 and 34, according to the same survey.
Experts say that the biggest benefits of audio erotica are its ability for listeners to imagine and be in control of their own story.
"I tell clients and students, if you're constantly watching something, you're never getting to create your own fantasies, explore your erotic imagination and know what your boundaries are," said Mal Harrison, the executive director of the Center for Erotic Intelligence, a collective of researchers and educators who study human connection and sexuality. Audio erotica, she said, is a response to power imbalances and sexual domination often seen in visual pornography.
Before these apps existed, Reddit threads and the back alleys of Tumblr were often used to create erotic audio content particularly made by and for women.
"It felt like when you wanted accessibility to pleasure, it was in a brown paper bag down a dark alley," said Dominnique Karetsos, the chief executive and co-founder of Healthy Pleasure Group, which invests in sexual health and technology companies, including Dipsea. When she started investing in the space nearly 10 years ago, the market was limited, she added.
But by the early 2010s, Ms. Karetsos said, products made for women's pleasure were marketed through partnerships with retailers like Selfridges and Sephora. The accessibility to and demand for these items created "social permission," she said, for women to talk about pleasure openly.
Last year The New York Times reported that Facebook rejected numerous women's sexual health advertisements. In 2019, the sex toy company Dame sued the M.T.A. for banning its advertisements while those for erectile dysfunction medication remained.
Gina Gutierrez, who founded Dipsea with Faye Keegan, said that much of what set audio erotica apart was that it was marketed as sexual wellness, unlike conventional porn. "Female pleasure is seen as especially gratuitous and frivolous," she said. "We wanted people to feel like they were making a choice that was good for them."
'It's actually like a wellness practice'
Liv Trexler downloaded Dipsea in 2021 after seeing its advertisement on social media. "It was weird at first," she said. "But when I actually tried it, things went well, very well."
She now uses Dipsea regularly and said the $ 12.99 monthly subscriber fee was worth the cost. "It's not harmful to those who make it, and it's not a harmful thing to those who hear it," said Ms. Trexler, a 29-year-old project manager who lives in Brooklyn. "It's actually like a wellness practice."
Angela Sarakan, a senior audio producer at Dipsea, said that the dialogue featured in its podcasts could provide listeners the tools to set healthy boundaries. "You're listening in on the private worlds of these characters and, in that way, learning more about yourself and the way you might want to communicate or do things differently."
Audio erotica's emphasis on communication and boundary-setting has helped some users with anxiety around visual porn.
"It was very hard for me to extricate any idea of sex, especially casual sex, from feeling safe," said a 25-year-old woman who was a victim of sexual assault. The woman, who requested not to be identified by her full name, said audio erotica helped her reconnect with her body through imagination. "It helped me get out of my head a little bit in terms of self-consciousness, like comparing my movements and my body to people on the screen," she said. "It made me see how you could have your sex life as part of a creative, imaginary life that feels meaningful."
Olivia Taylor, the editorial lead of Dipsea, said the app's goal was to capture the "texture of life and the texture of sex." Dirty talk, moans and the ruffling of sheets are just some of the sounds you may hear on the app. Dipsea's characters are often written with enough specificity for listeners to relate to, but vague enough for them to imagine themselves inside the story.
"It might make you be like, 'Hey, wait, that's not me, this is some other person or some other body that doesn't feel like mine at all,"' Ms. Taylor said. The editorial team, she added, keeps this in mind as they edit.
Aisha Jordan, an actress and a spoken word artist, was among the first to audition as a voice actress for Dipsea in early 2019. She landed the role of Liz and has since narrated many other stories. "Sometimes you're breathing into a microphone for 20 seconds," she said. "Sometimes you have to do something like kiss your hand to get a more authentic sound."
Ms. Jordan receives a full character description and a story arc with each script. "It's not just a sexual moment. It's an experience," she said. "Especially for a woman of color to be able to do this, it's super exciting. It allows you to be seen as a full person and not just stereotypes."
Although sexual wellness is a growing industry, research on the subject is still met with skepticism.
"It's just highly stigmatized, more so than drugs," said Dr. Nicole Prause, a neuroscientist who studies how pleasure can be used as a treatment for chronic pain, anxiety, sleep disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. "I almost lost my graduate funding." She said she no longer uses the word "sexual" in research proposals.
Dr. Prause hopes audio erotica will help raise awareness of the positive, if not therapeutic, outcomes of sexual wellness, though she recognizes its limitations.
Ms. Taylor of Dipsea believes that the format can at least offer an alternative. "We're showing much more than a snapshot of sex," she said. "It's the whole story of how people connect."

Full text: We're likely to spend more after a relationship ends. So why don't we budget for it?
For a month after a breakup in early June, I wavered between empowered mania and "Wuthering Heights" anguish. If I'd had access to moors I would have roamed them nightly à la the book's brutish, tormented hero, Heathcliff, wild-haired and sporting a messy cravat, but I was in Austin, Texas, where there is nary a moor and it's too hot for roaming. So, as I had done after previous breakups, I dabbled in retail therapy.
Once, I spent $ 100 on a wooden gorilla. On another occasion, I bought a philodendron that has since taken over my home, "Jumanji"-style. (If your aim is to purge a lover's memory, I suggest a less invasive plant.)
After this most recent split, however, I left the sphere of retail therapy and waltzed on the plane of shopping addiction. Sadly, the one thing I deemed too expensive was talking to a therapist. Instead, I bought a ticket to Mexico to join my sister at a resort I couldn't afford. I signed up for a Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card, with its $ 550 annual fee and impressive travel benefits, reasoning that it would make more trips to Mexico possible.
I spent $ 165 on a deep-tissue massage and $ 130 on an annual subscription to MasterClass. I mined La Perla's sale items, which are still preposterously expensive. (You can put a price on a perfect décolletage, and it is $ 173.)
Having been DoorDash-sober for months after a New Year's resolution, I began ordering delivery again. My ex and I had cooked together often, and making dinner alone felt too depressing. Studying my credit card transactions at the end of the month, my hand over my mouth, I wished that I had made a budget.
Financial advisers often encourage us to have a rainy-day fund to cover small expenses that we haven't accounted for, such as unexpected bills or home repairs. But we are less inclined to budget for emotional incidentals, despite being likely to indulge in them whether we can afford to or not.
Scott Rick, a behavioral scientist at the University of Michigan, co-wrote a 2014 study that showed that engaging in retail therapy could reduce residual sadness by restoring a sense of control. His study even found that hypothetical, simulated purchases were soothing, which may validate those who unwind by building homes in The Sims.
"Shopping is all about choice," Dr. Rick said in an interview. "It's all about 'I want A and not B.' You're exerting some control over those simple outcomes of what you go home with."
He noted that choosing between pleasant options (such as summery coverlets, one of which I also bought after my breakup) is likely more curative than unpleasant ones, such as expensive home repairs.
"That helps to disrupt that negative cycle of thoughts, and sad feelings," he said. "You can become the captain of your own destiny again."
Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist in Los Angeles, said we have been encouraged to process our emotions through consumerism for our entire lives. As schoolchildren, for example, we settled our nerves about a new school year with back-to-school shopping.
"We have been so primed and taught to do that in all these ways," Ms. Clayman said. "It's more natural for us to turn to a consumer field of expression and processing than it is to say, 'Oh, I'm having a feeling -- let me plop my butt on the cushion and meditate on this for the next two weeks."'
She pointed out that Americans tended to imbue purchases with tremendous personal and cultural meaning. When others told me about their post-breakup splurges, which ranged from a needlepoint course to a $ 3,000 chair to first-class tickets to move two cats across the United States, I was impressed by how varied and personal they were. (Though the Dyson Airwrap, a $ 600 wand that both dries and styles hair, appears to be the standard scepter of those seeking to reinvent themselves; rugs, too, were described as transformative several times.)
One male friend, who invited several people to an Airbnb in Montana a few years ago, said that, in hindsight, he would characterize the vacation as a breakup splurge.
Lauren Fish, a 33-year-old consultant in Chicago, invested in boxing classes and gear that now sits unused in her closet. Jennifer Sinski, a 36-year-old publicist in Austin, bought a Peloton and a dachshund she named Honey. Julie Vadnal, a 38-year-old editor in New York, bought a $ 650 custom flip-sequin dress from the designer Batsheva Hay.
"I was so depressed, and she measured me for it there in person, and I felt so loved and taken care of," Ms. Vadnal recalled. "I have zero regrets, despite having only worn it once."
Ms. Clayman suggested that rather than trying to maintain total control over our behaviors and feeling guilty when we can't, we should give ourselves license -- within reason -- to follow our impulses. When I floated the idea of a breakup budget for those of us who struggle with the "within reason" addendum, Ms. Clayman was enthusiastic.
"In doing this kind of budgeting work, one of the things that I'm really insistent about is that we do allocate money -- as soon as we're above safety needs being met -- and if not money, time, for nurturing the self," she said.
It occurred to me that after a certain point in my breakup bacchanal, my spending had ceased to be therapeutic and had become merely a habit, as had other behaviors that bloomed from sadness, such as lying in bed for an hour after my alarm woke me up and listening to Billie Eilish exclusively. I suspected a budget might have served as a boundary not just for my retail therapy, but for my wallowing in general.
I was surprised, then, when Dr. Rick, who studies money in relationships, discouraged a breakup budget -- at least in the way I had conceived it, which would be a fund that I would contribute to over the duration of a relationship.
"When you have a backup plan, you try less hard at the thing you're doing," he said.
He clarified that he was not opposed to breakups or divorces, and that he agreed that some relationships should crumble. He would support a breakup fund, he said, "if it's something that you and your friends decide on when you're 18 and you're not actively in a long-term relationship, like, 'Oh, this is something we should do in the future if we ever have breakups.' I don't think it's good to do three months into a relationship."
I agreed that it might be a sign of trouble if someone began financing their breakup haircut one fiscal quarter into a new romance. There was something perversely optimistic, however, about creating a breakup fund before I had even begun a relationship. I had gathered, from long hours spent among the sages of Reddit in recent weeks, that being open to disappointment is a key component of moving on from a relationship.
In Qapital, a personal finance app that connects to your bank account and automatically deposits money into various "goals" whenever, for instance, you shop at Sephora, I set up a recurring weekly deposit of $ 5 into a breakup fund. I don't check the app often, so I hope to forget about it until a post-breakup Glossier splurge reminds me that there is a piggy bank to be smashed.
My month of excesses, particularly a bowl of ceviche I ate on a beach in Mexico next to one of my loved ones, really did make me feel better about my breakup. At least, I spent so much money preparing my mind and body to sidle back into dating that I felt committed to doing so.
But I could have done without the guilt and the months of asceticism that it will take to stabilize my finances. Next time -- but hopefully there won't be a next time -- I'll be better prepared.

Full text: More Than Likes is a series about social media personalities who are trying to do positive things for their communities.
To Shirley Raines, they are royalty: The woman with the paralyzed arm who uses a shoelace as a sling. The man whose hands shake as he opens his bag. The little girl who, when seeing Ms. Raines and her bright coif, shouts "pink hair!"
Ms. Raines, 55, provides food, hygienic services and unconditional support to people without a home through her nonprofit in Los Angeles, Beauty 2 the Streetz. They are all "kings" and "queens."
This is how she sees the people she serves: royals who have been dealt a bad hand.
'It's become a little internet family'
Ms. Raines wants to spread that outlook -- and has harnessed social media to do so. A camera hangs in the truck where she passes out food, capturing moments that are uploaded to her TikTok and Instagram accounts (5.3 million and 373,000 followers) that she hopes are changing the narrative on homelessness. It is also a fund-raising device for an operation that runs entirely on donations, Ms. Raines said.
"People have grown to love some of the people that we support and take care of," Ms. Raines said. "It's become a little internet family."
Beauty 2 the Streetz became a registered nonprofit in 2019. Sydney Granados, the organization's executive coordinator, estimates that it feeds about 1,000 people each week, mostly on Skid Row, an area of Downtown Los Angeles. Some days, Ms. Raines brings McDonald's burgers. Other days it's pizza from Costco. Sometimes a chef in a food truck cooks enchiladas, chicken tortilla soup or vegan cauliflower steaks. Ms. Raines and her volunteers also hand out toiletries -- toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, shampoo -- and they even color hair.
"Homelessness is one of those very visual problems," said Ben Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the University of Southern California. "We see it all over the place, but actually seeing people for who they are, the humanity part, we often miss. These kinds of efforts that allow people to connect at a very individual level and be seen, I think, are hugely important for self-esteem."
Wherever she goes, Ms. Raines lifts moods, with some banter and light teasing. In March, when a man she calls Big T showed up wearing a too-tight jacket, Ms. Raines joked that he was going to "squeeze out like a biscuit." She's often seen wearing fluffy yellow sandals and long rainbow socks, and has learned American Sign Language to communicate with the deaf "kings and queens."
"She's very magnetic," Ms. Granados said. "She's enjoyable, funny, bright -- people love to be around her."
In 2021, Ms. Raines was named CNN's Hero of the Year, earning a $ 100,000 grant for her organization. The Beauty 2 the Streetz Patreon page pulls in about $ 6,000 each month, and the group also solicits donations on Venmo and Cash App. In recent months, those donations have allowed her to expand to San Diego, Las Vegas and Long Beach, Calif.
'My journey started with pain'
Ms. Raines's path to creating Beauty 2 the Streetz started in 1990, when she herself was without a home. Her son Demetrius J. Stephens Jr. spent a lot of time at her grandmother's home, in Compton, Calif. When Demetrius was 2 years old, she said, he accidentally swallowed an antipsychotic pill meant for one of her uncles and eventually died as a result. Ms. Raines was 23.
Ms. Raines "became a terror to this world," she said. "My journey started with pain, death, feeling like, 'why am I alive?"'
She had more children, moved into an apartment in Inglewood, Calif., with the help of a housing voucher, and got her first job as an adult working as a 411 operator. She began bodybuilding and became a fitness instructor before transitioning into a career as a medical biller.
Still, Ms. Raines said, suicidal thoughts shadowed her. "I endured a lot of freaking pain that people don't see," she said. "That's what drives this caboose."
After a heart-to-heart conversation in 2017 with her twin sister, who implored her to find greater emotional stability, Ms. Raines accompanied a friend to volunteer for Pauly's Project, a nonprofit serving homeless people in Los Angeles. She developed a rapport with some of the women she met, who kept complimenting her hair and makeup. So one day, Ms. Raines returned to a Pauly's Project event with beauty products from Sephora and a bucket of hot water. Ms. Raines dyed the women's hair and handed out makeup kits.
She eventually attracted a following so large that she went out on her own. She set herself up on Skid Row with a small team of volunteers, administering what she calls "spiritual C.P.R."
"Everybody wants to feel clean," Ms. Raines said. "Everybody wants to feel good about themselves. I have a queen right now, we did her hair purple a couple weeks ago. I've never seen her smile so big. Her hair, all the purple has washed out, but her smile is still the same, because of the lasting effects of all the praise she got when her hair was colored. Those things don't wash off."
Part of the appeal of her social media videos is the recurring cast of characters her followers have come to know -- and Ms. Raines's relationship with them. One woman, who had been pregnant in a previous video, recently showed up to the truck with her newborn.
"She had the baby!" Ms. Raines screamed ecstatically, turning to the camera. "She had the baby!"
The effort, though, hasn't been easy and has taken a toll. Her growing celebrity has been particularly tough on her children, she said. "When they were growing up, I was a woman with a short temper, partying, never had money for them to do anything," she said. "The world is calling me an angel, and they don't see me as an angel."
Ms. Raines thinks often of the son she buried. She is particularly moved by the children she serves who come to her without parents.
"I think they help me as much as I help them."

Unrest Eases in France, Nearly a Week After a Fatal Police Shooting: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The number of arrests fell sharply following several nights of violence. But tensions remain high, especially after a string of attacks on elected officials.
The violent protests and unrest that spread across France after the fatal police shooting of a teenager last week diminished significantly overnight, the authorities said on Monday.
Still, as a reminder that tensions remained high, French mayors organized peaceful gatherings across the country to protest violent attacks on elected officials. And the issues underlying the explosion of anger -- especially a deep-seated mistrust of the police in France's poorer urban suburbs -- appeared far from resolved.
Nearly 160 people were arrested and three law enforcement officers were injured overnight, the Interior Ministry said on Monday morning, far fewer than in previous days, when as many as 1,300 people were taken into custody.
"When you arrest 3,200 people, when the courts put people on trial, when you put on a show of republican force -- a fair order, but an order, nonetheless -- I think that has largely contributed to this return to calm," Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, told reporters in Reims on Monday.
Fewer episodes were reported across the country, after the authorities deployed 45,000 police officers and gendarmes for the third night in a row in an effort to bring the situation under control. The same number will deployed on Monday night, Mr. Darmanin said.
Nearly a week of violence was set off by the fatal police shooting of Nahel Merzouk, a 17-year-old French citizen of North African descent, during a traffic stop last Tuesday morning in Nanterre, a Paris suburb.
The officer who fired the shot has not been publicly identified. He was quickly placed under formal investigation on charges of voluntary homicide and detained -- a rare step in cases involving police officers.
But Mr. Merzouk's killing unleashed a burst of frustration and violence that has underlined stark divisions in French society -- some of which were on plain display through dueling online fund-raising efforts.
One fund, set up by a far-right commentator and former spokesman for Éric Zemmour, a far-right presidential candidate, to support the police officer's family, had raised over 1.1 million euros, about $ 1.2 million, by Monday evening. The other, set up anonymously to help Mr. Merzouk's family, had raised over 235,000 euros, about $ 256,000, at that same time.
French officials have said the violence was carried out by a minority motivated by something other than justice for Mr. Merzouk and wider concerns about their treatment at the hands of the authorities.
"When you loot a Foot Locker, a Lacoste store or a Sephora boutique, there is no political message," Olivier Véran, the French government spokesman, said on Sunday, listing stores that had been looted.
While their exact numbers are hard to estimate, rioters have burned thousands of cars, attacked hundreds of buildings -- including police stations, schools, businesses and town halls -- looted supermarkets and stores, and clashed night after night for nearly a week with the police in cities across the country.
Many residents of France's poorer urban suburbs have condemned the violence but have also said that they understood the anger that fueled the unrest, which morphed from an outburst of rage concentrated in the Paris suburbs into a broader wave of violence.
"We are afraid of the police," said Nassima Seddini, 24, a resident of Clichy-sous-Bois, the northeastern suburb of Paris where two teenagers running from the police were electrocuted in 2005 after they hid in an electrical substation, provoking weeks of violent protests in the country.
Ms. Seddini and friends with her in Clichy-sous-Bois on Monday all condemned the violence, calling it useless. But they said that little had changed since 2005 and that repeated police checks and mishandling of minorities were still commonplace.
"It only happens to Black, Arab and Muslim people, and that's been the case for a while," she said.
Two passengers were in the car with Mr. Merzouk when he was killed. One has already been questioned by the police and released. The other fled the scene but was questioned by investigators as a witness on Monday, according to the prosecutor's office in Nanterre.
Mayors and their constituents had gathered peacefully in front of dozens of town halls in the country to protest the violence. President Emmanuel Macron is also expected to meet on Tuesday with the mayors of over 200 municipalities hit by the unrest.
Near Tours, rioters tried to set a mayor's car on fire, while in Charly, a town south of Lyon, a flaming torch was placed in front of the mayor's home.
There were broader concerns that mayors, already the first to face discontent when state services are rolled back, are increasingly becoming targets of physical violence. Most recently, a mayor attracted nationwide attention after he resigned because of an arson attack on his home and threats from the far-right over the opening of a refugee center in his town.
"What we want today is a civic awakening," David Lisnard, the mayor of Cannes and the head of the Association of Mayors of France, said on Monday in front of his town hall.
A weekend attack on the home of Vincent Jeanbrun, the mayor of L'Haÿ-les-Roses, a usually quiet town of about 30,000 inhabitants in the southern suburbs of Paris, resonated throughout the country.
Early Sunday, as Mr. Jeanbrun was monitoring the situation at his office, assailants rammed a car into his home with the intention of setting it on fire, according to local prosecutors, who have opened an attempted-murder investigation.
The mayor's wife fled through the back garden with the couple's children, injuring her leg in the process.
The French government and politicians from across the spectrum have rallied to support Mr. Jeanbrun, who was joined on Monday by dozens of elected officials wearing blue, white and red stashes -- many of them members, like him, of the conservative Republican party -- for a march in L'Haÿ-les-Roses.
"Enough is enough," Mr. Jeanbrun said in a speech after the march, as the crowd clapped and echoed his words.
The authorities have in particular expressed alarm over the young age of many of those who have been arrested in the past week, urging parents to keep their children at home. Mr. Darmanin said that the average age of those arrested was 17 and that some were as young as 12. About 60 percent of the 3,200 people arrested in the past week had no criminal record, he added.
In Nanterre, the mayor, Patrick Jarry, also organized a peaceful gathering to support elected officials, and he condemned the violence, which he said had been minimal in his town on Sunday night. But he insisted there was still a "demand for justice" after Mr. Merzouk's killing.
"Let's not lose sight of how this situation started," Mr. Jarry said.

Full text: Mackenzie Thomas has built a following by sharing diary entries from her adolescent years that make people feel less embarrassed by their past selves.
Most people wouldn't want anyone to catch a glimpse of what's inside their teenage diaries. Puberty-era chronicles about crushes, changing bodies and being grounded -- all inked in colorful glitter -- would be too embarrassing (or traumatizing) to revisit, even in private. But not for Mackenzie Thomas.
Ms. Thomas, 24, has amassed more than 440,000 followers on TikTok by posting videos in which she monotonously reads aloud old diary entries. "How are the boys at school supposed to understand me when my brain is a computer?" she ponders in an entry from 2012.
In another scraggly note, written two years later, she documented eating lip gloss her mother had bought her: "It was from Sephora. It was vanilla coconut flavored. And tonight in my room I squirted the whole thing in my mouth and digested it."
She continued: "I am a gross girl. I am a sad girl."
The contents of her teenage memoirs -- unsanitized, largely unedited and filled with many expletives -- seem to resonate with many TikTok users.
The comments section overflows with viewers' own mortifying teenage memories. "It's become a space for people to feel less alone and less weird about themselves," Ms. Thomas said. "If I'm able to work my past humility and shame into stuff that makes millions of people feel seen, that's the ultimate gift."
Edwin Malavé Maldonado, a 36-year-old illustrator in Puerto Rico, wrote in a comment on one of Ms. Thomas's posts: "I feel like you've lived random episodes of my life in a weird multiverse kind of way." In an interview, he added that the diary entries capture "the surrealism of our teenage thoughts, those first-world problems that drown our mundane existence."
Ms. Thomas, who lives in Brooklyn, remembers the first time her mother bought her a journal. She was 11, and the journal was from a Target in North Carolina, where she grew up. Jotting down her innermost thoughts was a much-needed outlet, especially as a mixed-race child.
"My mom is Black and my dad is white," Ms. Thomas said. "I went to a white, white school, and I was not white enough for those white girls." She said that she often felt alienated in grade school, so she began to write everything down -- things that kept her up at night, things that made her laugh, things she loved and things she hated.
She has accumulated more than 20 diaries since then, though some are only partly full. They sit in a stack next to her bed.
In 2021, Ms. Thomas graduated from Emerson College with a degree in comedic arts and was living in Los Angeles, where she built a modest following on TikTok from posting funny videos. In one, she mocked Julia Fox's pronunciation of the movie title "Uncut Gems" as "uncuh jamz," which became a viral trend. "I'm chasing a belly laugh from myself all the time," Ms. Thomas said.
Wondering how to keep her followers -- and herself -- laughing, she turned to her diaries. She had already been in the habit of reading them when she was feeling down to remind herself that her "problems were actually hilarious," she said. Why not share that same joy with the rest of the world? "I'm over cringing at myself, and I have been over it for a very long time," she said.
Some of the diary posts have been viewed millions of times. Many are laugh-out-loud funny, even the painful ones, like a 2016 entry about her mother telling her she had "a creepy alien touch." In another post, Ms. Thomas reads an entry about overhearing her father on the phone, telling someone he was taking her to violin lessons when he was really taking her to improv class.
"As an adult, it's easier to be celebrated for things that make you different," Ms. Thomas said. "When you're a kid, what keeps you safe is being the same as everyone else."
Now, revisiting those times -- of feeling like an alien, and sometimes being told she was one too -- is healing. "I can be an older sister to myself," said Ms. Thomas, who is an only child.
"These videos are exemplars of meme culture, in they use humor as a vehicle to dig deeply into shared emotion," said Heather Suzanne Woods, an assistant professor of media and communication at Kansas State University, in an email. Professor Woods added that "the wisdom of young people can be overlooked by society as superfluous," but Ms. Thomas's videos give some insight into their unvarnished thoughts.
When Sheryl Hadad, an accountant in Israel, first saw one of Ms. Thomas's posts, she felt an instant connection. "There was something about the way she says things that makes every situation feel close and personal, like someone finally says what we're all thinking and feeling," she said.
Ms. Hadad, 21, even got a tattoo of a line from one of Ms. Thomas's diaries that reads: "A wet sack of potatoes knows more about happiness than I do."

Lube Too Chic for the Sock Drawer: [Style Desk]

Full text: With minimalist labeling and elegant packaging, a new generation of personal lubricants can seem more self-care than sex aid. Make room on the night stand.
For Portia Brown, a sex coach in Brooklyn, lube is nonnegotiable. "I don't think I've had sex in the last five years without reaching for a lubricant," she said.
Inside her night stand drawer is an array of personal lubricants: some silicone-based, some oil-based, some infused with CBD. One thing most of them have in common, however, is the chic packaging and bottles they come in, imbuing a sex aid with the allure of a beauty product.
According to Ms. Brown, the elevated design feeds into today's consumer tastes. "It's sort of a backdoor way to get people into using lubricants," she said. "I can sit this on the shelf with all of my skin care products and all my perfume and it looks just as beautiful as everything else that I use and douse my body with."
What once was hidden away in a Ziploc bag in the corner of your sock drawer is now being sold in design-forward containers meant to live on top of your night stand. Indeed, there is now a "lube aesthetic."
On a recent visit to a Sephora on West 34th Street in Manhattan, I noticed a small, bottom-shelf display of natural lubricant products. But the bottles looked nothing like the basic plastic squeeze tubes of lube I've seen inside pharmacies or next to the condoms behind a gas station counter.
The product, Shine personal lubricant by Maude, the first brand in a category now called "sexual wellness" to be stocked at Sephora, was packaged in an eight-ounce, amber-colored bottle, with a black pump and a minimalist white text design. At a glance, it could easily be mistaken for a bottle of Aesop hand soap or some fancy essential oil.
According to Éva Goicochea, who founded the brand in 2018, it was all led by design and was meant to show consumers that lube is "not a scary thing."
Ms. Goicochea said her team didn't consider other design options for the Maude lube bottle. It was a decision based on the resources they had, all while being gender- and age-inclusive to create a product that "felt elevated."
"When it's on my night stand, I'm like, OK, it looks like my other products and it doesn't stand out, it doesn't make me uncomfortable," she said. "I know that sounds funny coming from me because I started this company, but I'm a private person."
Although that Sephora trip was my first time seeing Maude in stores, it wasn't my first time hearing about it. Months ago, I saw it displayed proudly next to someone's bed, right next to his bedside lamp. More recently, when conversation at a dinner party turned to lube, a couple of friends said they were fans of the product not just for how it felt, but also for how it looked.
Other brands, including Bloomi, Foria and Dame, have taken a similarly aesthetic approach, presenting their products in such a way that makes you feel as if you're pampering yourself. Glissant's flavored lube comes in a mini gold spray bottle, similar to a travel perfume.
This shift in how lube is packaged reflects how people are owning their pleasure and sex lives without guilt or shame.
Personal lubricants for sex have been around for thousands of years, taking the early form of seaweed and olive oil. In 1917, K-Y Jelly became the first product specifically marketed as a personal lubricant, but it was available only via prescription until the 1980s. Lube was further mainstreamed in the 1990s, and by the 2000s, many options and brands were available.
Although most of the stigma surrounding personal lubricants has faded, there can still be a whiff of embarrassment around using it, even though it's been shown to make engaging in penetrative sex and using sex toys a more pleasant experience. For some, no amount of chic labeling or fancy bottles will persuade them to display their lube, whether for fear of coming off as promiscuous to potential partners or as someone who engages in a lot of "me time."
Yet some men still worry that if a woman needs lube, it means she's not turned on. There are women who worry that if she needs lube, her partner might think something is wrong with her. Even though natural lubrication is not our bodies' only arousal response, it can sometimes feel like the only one that matters.
"We live in a society where a self-lubricating vulva and vagina is celebrated and one that does not is shamed," said Ms. Brown, the sex coach and self-described "lube enthusiast." "If you don't have a Super Soaker between your legs, that's actually completely normal and fine and a common experience."
As a coach who wants people to have more enthusiastic and authentic sexual experiences, Ms. Brown said this shift in the marketing and design of personal lubricants was a game changer.
"At this point, I'm not buying lube that's not in a cute bottle," she said.

Full text: DEPARTMENT STORES
After Reducing Inventory Kohl's Reports Profits
Kohl's posted a surprise profit for the fiscal first quarter, helped by the department store chain's moves to cut inventory in the wake of weak sales.
The company, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., said that it cut inventory by 6 percent while it continued to see sales momentum with its Sephora beauty shops.
The department store chain said in early March that it also planned to be more surgical with discounts and change how it showcases its merchandise after reporting a big loss and a sales slump in the fourth quarter.
"Our first-quarter results were in line with our expectations and represented a first step as we work to drive sales and earnings performance over the long-term," said C.E.O. Tom Kingsbury in a statement.
Kohl's is the first major department store to report fiscal first quarter results, but overall the latest bunch of reports underscore a slowdown in consumer spending. ASSOCIATED PRESS
BANKING
Citigroup Plans Spin Off Of Banamex Franchise
Citigroup plans to spin off its Banamex banking franchise, the company said on Wednesday, a deal that would bring an end to Citi's two-decade push into Latin America.
Citi had announced last year that it planned to explore options for the Banamex business, which included a possible sale of the company to a rival bank or a major investor. Under C.E.O. Jane Fraser, Citi has been looking to simplify its business and pull out of 14 international markets where the bank does not have scale or significant operations.
But Banamex, or Banco Nacional de Mexico, is not a small part of Citi's business. Since buying the company in 2001, Citi has grown Banamex to Mexico's fourth-largest banking company, with 1,300 branches and 13 million customers. Banamex employs roughly 38,000 workers in the country.
Citi expects Banamex to separate the two businesses by the end of 2024 and the newly separated company will go public sometime in 2025. ASSOCIATED PRESS
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Microvast Eyes Options After Grant Is Canceled
Microvast Holdings is considering all its options, the lithium battery maker said Wednesday, after the Energy Department canceled a $ 200 million grant following lawmakers' concerns over the company's suspected links to China.
"Neither the Chinese government nor the Chinese Communist Party has any ownership in the company, nor do they control or influence company operations in any way," Microvast's chief executive, Yang Wu, said in a statement.
The grant, which stemmed from a $ 1 trillion 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, was to help Microvast build a plant in Tennessee.
Two Republican lawmakers criticized the grant decision in a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in December, saying Microvast had ties to the Chinese Communist Party.
The grant was further targeted to support work by General Motors and Microvast on developing specialized E.V. battery separator technology. REUTERS

Economic Fears Hurt Markets Worldwide: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street fell again on Wednesday as stocks tumbled worldwide because of worries about the economy.
The S&P 500 dropped 0.7 percent after Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Republicans and Democrats remained "far apart" in their efforts to prevent a potentially disastrous default on the U.S. government's debt. The main U.S. stock index is on track for its worst week in more than two months as the once-unthinkable creeps closer to possibility.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 255 points, or 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq composite lost 0.6 percent.
Other markets around the world fell even more as discouraging figures piled up on the economy. Stock indexes tumbled 1.7 percent in London, 1.9 percent in Frankfurt and 1.6 percent in Hong Kong.
Inflation in the United Kingdom remains worse than expected, raising worries that the Bank of England may keep raising interest rates and squeezing its economy. In Germany, business confidence fell in Europe's largest economy. And in China, worries remain about a weaker-than-hoped reopening from Covid restrictions as tensions rise with the United States over technology and security.
On Wall Street, the focus is squarely on Washington, where the U.S. government could run out of cash to pay its bills as soon as June 1 unless Congress allows it to borrow more. The widespread expectation is that a default would result in tremendous economic pain.
The stock market has remained mostly resilient despite the worries. Fear has so far been concentrated in the bond market, where prices have dropped for Treasury bills due to pay out around the date of a possible default. Price drops for bonds raise their yields, and the yield on a Treasury maturing June 1 jumped to 7.22 percent, up by nearly 1.25 percentage points from a day before, according to Tradeweb.
The widespread belief on Wall Street has been that Congress will come to an agreement at the 11th hour, as it has done several times before, because a default would benefit no one.
"It will sort itself out over the next couple of weeks and end up being a positive catalyst," said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.
Still, concerns are rising that Congress may not feel urgency to act unless markets fall sharply enough to force politicians' hands. A measure of fear among stock investors on Wall Street climbed 8 percent and is near its highest level since March. That was when worries were flaring hottest about the strength of the banking system, as it creaked under the weight of much higher interest rates.
Rates are so high because the Federal Reserve has yanked them up at the fastest pace in decades in hopes of getting high inflation under control. High rates do that by putting the brakes on the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. That has many investors bracing for a recession even if Congress reaches a deal on the debt limit.
Helping to limit Wall Street's losses were several companies that reported stronger results for the start of the year than analysts had expected.
Kohl's jumped 7.5 percent after reporting a surprise profit for its latest quarter, helped in part by momentum at its Sephora beauty shops. Analysts had expected it to turn in a loss.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 30.34, to 4,115.24. The Dow dropped 255.59, to 32,799.92, and the Nasdaq lost 76.08, to 12,484.16.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.71 percent from 3.70 percent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.37 percent from 4.33 percent.

Full text: A mother finds herself spiritually out of stock at the Glossier flagship store in New York City.
My children and I were visiting New York City's most important landmarks, so naturally we began our journey at the Glossier flagship store in SoHo.
This store isn't a store so much as a national monument built to honor the brave few who fought to bring Futuredew oil serum hybrid and Cloud Paint seamless cheek color to the pale and dehydrated masses. Ever since 2014, those loyal to dewiness and glossiness have sought a consecrated place to pay homage to Balm Dotcom universal salve and Boy Brow grooming pomade. These and about 20 other small items luxuriate in roughly 3200 square feet of minimalist white space bathed in soft pink light, embodying the higher purpose at the heart of the Glossier mission:
At Glossier, we make products inspired by real life. We believe beauty is about having fun, celebrating freedom, and being present, because no matter where you are in your beauty journey -- YOU LOOK GOOD.
The mirror in the Glossier flagship store would like a word.
Although my children led me here to celebrate freedom, my personal beauty journey appears to have stalled out in some back alley where unsightly red splotches and desiccated lips have replaced plant-based, buttery moisture. I elbow my way through a hoard of teenagers to test Ultralip in Coupe, described as "a blood orange red." The Glossier website claims that wearing this lipstick feels just like "pulling on buttery-soft, well-loved cashmere sweatpants." But applying it with a Q-Tip under these late-pandemic conditions feels more like eating from a buffet table set up in a biological weapons lab.
I expect to be miraculously transformed into a fresh-faced teenager, but in the mirror I discover a creased old crone with inexplicably neon-orange lips.
"Oh Christ," I mutter. One of my eyebrows is very long -- we're talking Ernest Borgnine long. Now I'm chuckling maniacally. Dewy children close in around me on all sides, impatient for their turn at the mirror.
Forget that the entire Glossier product line could fit easily into one small tote bag. Forget that most of these kids have already purchased these items several times online. The point is to see the products in their native habitat, christened in soft pink light, patrolled by ladies in light pink jumpsuits with tablets in their hands, each ready to help us have more fun and be more present.
I pick up a tube of Balm Dotcom in Birthday. There's a little sticker on the side of it with the words OUT OF STOCK written on it. I pick up another tube. OUT OF STOCK.
Many of the 20 or so products present are OUT OF STOCK.
This shortage has the effect of bestowing the few remaining in stock items with an air of preciousness and necessity. My older daughter selects a tube of lavender Balm Dotcom, the only scent currently available. We marvel at how very lavender it smells. Its lavenderness starts to feel almost miraculous, like stumbling on an old canister of Glade rug and room deodorizer spray from 1987 and huffing it into your lungs until you're hammered on the fumes.
I fish for my phone and pull up the Glossier store online. Every item is in stock. At the Sephora down the block later that day, the entire Glossier line is available. This supply chain crisis seems limited to the exact 3200 square feet of prime Soho real estate dedicated to celebrating these products and their sublime contributions to the human endeavor.
We've unknowingly stumbled into the center of an emollient void, a serum desert. Products that were a click away a few minutes earlier are now unreachable. The realization spreads from one young face to another: There are no universal salves! Life is short and brutal and sheer, shimmering veils of blendable eye color are few and far between!
Now what once glowed with a rosy flush of youthful optimism has assumed the pale pink of a fading heart unable to go on, knowing that undetectable, flexible coverage could be ripped out of one's grasp in a single, fleeting moment.
Perhaps the national Glossier monument was cleverly designed for this very purpose -- to incite sensations of panic and loss in all who enter. Drawn in by this shimmering lodestar of freedom, visitors are soon forced to reckon with an archaic world where parched skin and chapped elbows were daily realities. With each mounting OUT OF STOCK sticker, young hearts must grapple with the harsh truth: Beauty was not about fun during the Middle Ages. Staying dewy during the Crusades mostly meant scavenging tubers out of a neighbor's muddy field without getting mauled by his bloodthirsty hounds. Being present was a major challenge during the Irish potato famine of 1845. For several centuries before industrialization, your beauty journey mostly included soaking gout-ridden feet in a cold stream, dragging a rough stone over calloused elbows, or rubbing pig fat into prematurely graying temples. And if you somehow managed to LOOK GOOD, that only got you married off to the wealthy old butcher 20 years your senior who lived in a nearby village and spent his leisure hours throwing axes at the wall. Life was neither energizing nor cruelty-free!
In stark contrast to this overheated age of never ending glow-ups, human existence has long been marked by sacrifice and drought, scrounging and suffering, unwanted body hair and uncontrollable hives!
"Let's go to the Lego flagship store now," my younger daughter says as we exit Glossier. "There might be a line outside, though."
Heather Havrilesky writes the Ask Polly advice column on Substack and is the author of four books, most recently the memoir "Foreverland."

Full text: For nearly four years, the Tiffany & Company flagship store on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 57th Street was shrouded in scaffolding while it underwent a full-bore renovation. In the days before the reopening, set for April 28, a Tiffany executive vice president, Alexandre Arnault, and the company's chief executive, Anthony Ledru, monitored final preparations as they whispered to each other in French.
Display cases glittered with Tiffany pieces -- heart tag bracelets, Elsa Peretti Bone cuffs and Paloma Picasso necklaces. Digital screens encircling the room showed an animation of a diamond-encrusted bird fluttering across the New York City skyline.
"We asked ourselves lots of questions going into this," Mr. Ledru, 50, said. "Are we going to change the feel? Do we respect tradition? We decided to do both."
He gestured toward the digitized bird, noting that it was based on a design by the noted Tiffany jewelry artist Jean Schlumberger.
"There's that tension: modernity and heritage," he said.
A lot has changed at Tiffany since the makeover began. Namely, the company's ownership. In 2021, after fraught negotiations, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired Tiffany for about $ 16 billion. The sale was one of the largest deals ever in the luxury world, as well as LVMH's most significant American brand acquisition to date.
In effect, the jewelry emporium became the property of Bernard Arnault, the 74-year-old founder, chairman and largest shareholder of LVMH, who recently dethroned Elon Musk as the world's richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Over three decades, he has built a kingdom of more than 75 brands, including Dior, Celine, TAG Heuer, Bulgari, Fendi, Dom Pérignon and Sephora.
As construction workers toiled away on the ground floor last week, one of Mr. Arnault's five children, Alexandre Arnault, 30, stood near the spot where "Equals Pi," a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, would go. The painting, which features a shade of blue similar to Tiffany's signature color, appeared prominently in Tiffany's 2021 "About Love" ad campaign starring Jay-Z and Beyoncé.
"When people enter from Fifth Avenue, they will see the Basquiat," said Alexandre Arnault, who wore a Dior suit and Loro Piana sneakers. "It's an important part of the Tiffany brand now."
Tall and lanky, Mr. Arnault, who is responsible for much of Tiffany's creative vision, was one of the architects of the "About Love" campaign. The use of the Basquiat spurred a bit of controversy when a former Basquiat assistant insisted that the artist hadn't intended any homage to the brand.
But that didn't matter much from a marketing perspective: The Tiffany name was in the news for days, signaling that it no longer belonged solely to the era when Holly Golightly (portrayed by Audrey Hepburn) admired the vitrines of its flagship in the 1961 film "Breakfast at Tiffany's." The new Tiffany, the LVMH Tiffany, was showing itself as a brand that could also be disruptive and viral.
Amid speculation about which of the Arnault children will succeed the LVMH founder, Alexandre Arnault was tasked with the job of overseeing the renovation of the Tiffany store, which the company calls the Landmark. Before moving from Paris to New York two years ago to immerse himself in the project, he reinvigorated the luggage company Rimowa, another LVMH brand, through collaborations with Virgil Abloh and Supreme.
Mr. Ledru, the Tiffany chief executive, who was born in the Brittany area of France and raised in Lille, is a luxury industry veteran who has worked for Louis Vuitton, Harry Winston and Cartier. When a droplet of blood appeared on his chin that afternoon, the result of a shaving cut, a publicist hurried to fetch him a napkin.
"This is not just another flagship," Mr. Ledru said. "For us, the Landmark is now the lighthouse of the brand."
The reboot left the building's facade untouched, and the Atlas statue clock still sits above its entrance, but it spared little else. The Landmark unabashedly represents LVMH's desire to imprint its DNA onto the company founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and John B. Young.
The Tiffany flagship opened on Fifth Avenue in 1940. When the gut renovation began in 2019, the store moved into the former Niketown site next door. The Landmark was designed by the architect Peter Marino, and its 10 floors are replete with works by artists like Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Richard Prince and Rashid Johnson. Flashy accouterments include a Daniel Boulud restaurant, the Blue Box Cafe, which serves a "Breakfast at Tiffany" meal, and an Audrey Hepburn experience room that features a replica of her black Givenchy dress from the movie's opening scene. (LVMH acquired Givenchy in 1988.)
"People relate a lot to her when it comes to Tiffany," Mr. Arnault said. "So we wanted to make a homage to her."
While giving a tour of the building to a reporter, the two executives walked up an undulating mirror-lined staircase inspired by Ms. Peretti's designs. The third floor specialized in wedding and engagement rings, the fourth in gold and diamonds, the fifth in silver and the sixth in home goods and accessories. The seventh floor included a Patek Philippe department and a jewelry workshop.
Mr. Ledru described the nuances that went into designing each floor, while Mr. Arnault strayed from the press tour, inspecting side rooms and taking photos with his phone.
Earlier, the two executives had sat for a more formal interview on a green couch in a book-lined room. Conservative and tight-lipped in its approach to public relations, LVMH would not disclose the Landmark's construction cost. A publicist, who sat in on the interview, said beforehand that inquiries about the LVMH succession were off-limits. Nonetheless, Mr. Arnault and Mr. Ledru fielded a few hot-seat questions.
At age 30, was Mr. Arnault feeling any heat to deliver on his mission for the family?
"Am I sweating?" he said. "No. Because I'm surrounded by the best professionals we could have."
On the eve of the Landmark's opening, were they concerned about talk that a recession may be on its way?
"There's ups and downs, but the one thing about the U.S. is that it comes back strong," Mr. Ledru said. "New York is much stronger now than it was last year and the year before. I don't want to be overly confident, but we're happy to finally open our doors.
Mr. Arnault added: "We're releasing our Q1 numbers for LVMH tomorrow. I encourage you to have a look."
(The day after the interview, LVMH reported a 17 percent rise in first-quarter sales, surpassing analyst expectations. In response, French workers protesting against pension changes stormed LVMH's Paris headquarters, calling for the rich to contribute more financing to the state pension.)
If they weren't nervous about the economy, were they worried about anything else?
"I'm anxious for the first holiday season," Mr. Arnault said. "It's such an important part of American culture. This is the first one back at the original Tiffany's corner."
"We were a lot more anxious a year ago, when we were receiving phone calls from Mr. Arnault asking, 'When do you open?"' Mr. Ledru said.
After the two men finished their tour of the Landmark, they stepped onto the building's eighth floor deck. They stood in the fresh spring breeze as they took in the view of Fifth Avenue.
"Pas mal, non?" Mr. Ledru said. ("Not bad, no?")
While construction workers hammered away behind them, hurrying to add the final touches on a glass-walled event space, Mr. Arnault took note of several other LVMH properties within his sight: There was Louis Vuitton just across the street, Bulgari opposite it and Dior down the way.
He smiled.
"I can spy on them," Mr. Arnault said. "I can make sure they're working from here."

NEW YORK — For nearly four years, the Tiffany & Co. flagship store on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 57th Street was shrouded in scaffolding while it underwent a full-bore renovation. In the days before the reopening, set for April 28, a Tiffany executive vice president, Alexandre Arnault, and the company’s CEO, Anthony Ledru, monitored final preparations as they whispered to each other in French.
Display cases glittered with Tiffany pieces — heart tag bracelets, Elsa Peretti bone cuffs and Paloma Picasso necklaces. Digital screens encircling the room showed an animation of a diamond-encrusted bird fluttering across the New York City skyline.
“We asked ourselves lots of questions going into this,” Ledru, 50, said. “Are we going to change the feel? Do we respect tradition? We decided to do both.”

France Leads the List Of the Global Ultrarich: [Correction]

Full text: Two French business titans, Bernard Arnault of the LVMH empire and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers of L'Oréal, are named the world's wealthiest man and woman.
PARIS -- France, which has been riven lately by angry protests over income inequality, can now claim to have the world's richest man and woman: Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the heiress of the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal.
Their combined net worth is nearly $ 300 billion, according to Forbes's latest tally.
Mr. Arnault, 74, whose worldwide domain encompasses 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton handbags, Tiffany diamond rings, Christian Dior dresses and Sephora high-end cosmetics, leaped past American technology titans with a fortune estimated at $ 211 billion as of March 10, when the Forbes figures were tallied.
Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, 69, who has led the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest women for three straight years, had an estimated net worth of $ 80.5 billion. A granddaughter of L'Oréal's founder, she is on the company's board and together with her husband makes many of the controlling decisions. Her company's international cosmetics brands include Kiehl's, Lancôme, Maybelline New York and Essie.
The eye-popping figures, which include the billionaires' personal holdings of company stocks, testify to the resilience of wealthy consumers against a cost-of-living crisis, as high earners continued to splurge on luxury goods -- especially in the wake of pandemic lockdowns. L'Oréal had global sales of over $ 38 billion last year, while LVMH had record revenue of $ 80 billion.
"More people are flocking to spending on luxury goods after having survived Covid lockdowns," said Luca Solca, chief luxury goods analyst at Bernstein. "The middle class did suffer and is hollowing out. But the wealthy were untouched, and the upper middle class is spending on all fronts."
High-flying technology companies, on the other hand, have faced a major reckoning over the past year amid a surge in interest rates, high inflation and uncertain economic conditions. Rapid growth during the pandemic has been followed by widespread layoffs, and a nearly 30 percent slump in tech shares last year cut sharply into the fortunes of Elon Musk, owner of Twitter and Tesla, and Amazon's executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Musk slipped to second place in Forbes's rankings, with an estimated fortune of $ 180 billion, and Mr. Bezos came in third with $ 114 billion.
The Forbes rankings caused a sensation in France this week, touching off a new round of headlines about income inequality and igniting debates over whether the ultrarich have augmented their fortunes by paying too little in taxes.
The country has been gripped by strikes and increasingly violent street demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's pension overhaul, which intends to raise the minimum age of retirement to 64 from 62. But the nationwide demonstrations -- another is scheduled for Thursday -- have also become rallying points for a broader protest over a glaring wealth divide. In France, the richest 10 percent hold nearly half of the country's wealth, and the growth of that share has outpaced that held by the rest of the population, according to the French statistics agency Insee. Wealth "remains very unevenly distributed among the population," the agency said.
Many of the protesters have made Mr. Arnault a main target for their ire, wielding unflattering posters and images of the multibillionaire as the symbol of a deeper problem afflicting the country.
"Mr. Arnault is seen as the embodiment of the ultrarich," said Philippe Escande, an economics columnist for the newspaper Le Monde. "But France is a country where equality -- namely 'liberté, égalité and fraternité' -- is very important, dating all the way back to the Revolution," he said. "There is a problem with money."
Coinciding with the rise in Mr. Arnault's fortunes has been a visible flexing of LVMH's muscle around central Paris: Across the city, four-story-high billboards trumpet LVMH brands. The Champs-Élysées is dominated by a massive Dior building being refurbished next to a Louis Vuitton flagship store. On Wednesday, a day ahead of new protests, the militant CGT labor union unfurled a banner atop the Arc de Triomphe, within eyeshot of Mr. Arnault's boutiques, denouncing a higher retirement age. Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

Full text: In Esther Yi's weird and wondrous 'Y/N,' a bored young woman in thrall to a boy band buys a one-way ticket to Seoul.
Y/N, by Esther Yi
"We're more popular than Jesus," John Lennon infamously said of the Beatles. As houses of worship shut down in droves while pop music fandom grows ever more extreme, it seems unfair anew that he got such a drubbing.
"We no longer go to church once a week; we attend a stadium concert once a year," declares Masterson, one of several minor characters given excellent Dickensian names in Esther Yi's wondrous and strange first novel, "Y/N." It's a short book -- just over 200 pages -- but with big themes, like the precarity of love, and how the modern self is forged less in community than mass consumption.
Though he's oblivious to its implications, Masterson has just discovered evidence that his sort-of girlfriend, an anonymous narrator, has become obsessed with the youngest member of a Korean boy band. The star is called, with an inevitable echo of the Unification Church founder, Moon. His oldest bandmate is Sun, of course, with Jupiter, Mercuryand Venus rounding out the quintet. "There are so many lowercase gods in this secular, cynical era,"Masterson pontificates, waxing on about how philosophy has been supplanted by data, religion has become "a vending machine for manifestation and fulfillment," and so on. Many of us have dated a Masterson.
"Y/N" refers not to yes/no, as Moon will assume, but to the practice in fan fiction of leaving a space for Your/Name, so that readers can Mad Lib themselves into the narrative. But this abbreviation, too, has extra resonance. "He seemed to be asking 'why' of my existence," the narrator thinks when Moon reads aloud the first letter in the elaborate fanfic she's written for him. "'Why' I was what I was."
When another supporting character, who manufactures shoe soles and goes by O (shades of the erotic classic published under the pen name Pauline Réage), asks the narrator what letter she'd like to be, she chooses N, reasoning that "the two prongs of M perfectly captured Moon's bipedal stability" -- he's an exceptional dancer, with a background in ballet -- and she is comparatively "doddering."
Swirling around in this alphabet soup of identity is the idea that a parasocial relationship might be as fulfilling as, or anyway no less delusional than, traditional monogamy. Reading the narrator's obsessive Moon ruminations, I remembered more than once the weird intensity of Jerry Maguire's line "you complete me." During a livestream, she imagines another fan, a vegan, actually wishing to be "masticated by Moon."
What we learn about this unnamed narrator -- let's call her U.N. -- is delightful in its specificity. A Korean American living in Berlin, she works as a copywriter for a canned-artichoke-heart business. "I don't want my life to change," she tells the flatmate she met online, who's proselytizing for the band, "I want my life to stay in one place and be one thing as intensely as possible." But though leery of fandom, she falls hard and fast after one concert. Not for nothing is fame now near-synonymous with "virality"; to be struck by its power is indeed a kind of sickness.
Troubled by the news that Moon is retiring, U.N. consults on Zoom with a therapist in Los Angeles named Dr. Fishwife. "The best way to fall out of love," he advises her, "is to realize there exists no love out of which to fall." ("Y/N" is packed like a can of artichoke hearts with such useful epigrams.) Undaunted, she books a one-way ticket to Seoul, where she has an uncle, to track down and confront the object of her obsession, staying in an apartment building whose first floor contains, and this rings all too true, "a coffee shop where one could sit, and a coffee shop where one could not sit."
There's also a pilgrimage to the Polygon Plaza, HQ of the entertainment company that masterminded the boy band, where a Music Professor, the president, does a bit of waxing herself about how "people were running around in circles and indulging their small adorable freedoms, like wearing this or that outfit or sleeping with this or that person. They confused their navigation through the stunning variety of meaningless choices as an expression of their individuality." It's a stinging indictment of what it's become fashionable to call "late capitalism," as if anyone had an idea of its endpoint.
The main pleasure of "Y/N" is not so much its somewhat skeletal plot, which floats in and out of surreality like an adult "Phantom Tollbooth," as its corkscrew turns of language (also Tollboothian). I loved how Yi animates objects and reduces humans to collections of cells. The celestial group refers to its fans as "livers" -- maybe because it sounds like "lovers," but more because "we kept them alive," the narrator notes, "like critical organs."
Shelves of books snake through a dark library "in a disorderly line, not unlike intestines." Electronic door locks emit "smug beeps." Cosmetic sheet masks, a 30-day skin regimen packaged with images of the boy band, stay on way longer than they should. "In a month, my dead skin cells will fall away, and I'll be left with the juicier cells underneath," U.N. states flatly. "Then I'll be closer to who I really am."(This is how Sephora makes billions.)
In real life, K-pop fans are a sprawling entity, bigger and more online than Gaga's Monsters or Beyoncé's Hive: "armies" that have increasingly made incursions into politics and faced government censure. In its clever compactness, "Y/N" resists the junkiness of the internet where they reside, the fanfics and the livestreams and endless comments.
All that writing, that global "content," is now so ubiquitous, so endless, so cheap -- ChatGPT, bonjour -- it comes to seem like a toxic cloud, against which a well-formed novel like this counteracts, a blast of cleansing heat.

What Business Executives Really Mean: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Shop Talk examines the business jargon used by executives to elevate ordinary functions and conceal ugly truths.
/Shop Talk/
A column in The New York Times Sunday Business section that explores the hidden meaning of business jargon.
Perusing LinkedIn might not seem like the typical way to spend your downtime. But for Lora Kelley, a New York Times business reporting fellow interested in the ways business shapes culture, the platform is a gold mine for reporting ideas.
One evening last fall, Ms. Kelley came across a term that left her scratching her head: dogfooding. She had found gold. It was precisely the type of business jargon that Shop Talk, a column in The Times's Sunday Business section, was created last year to define. Ms. Kelley pursued the meaning of the term and learned that it was used by business executives at high-power tech firms such as Meta and Asana to refer to the banal practice of product testing.
"Business jargon has always existed," said Veronica Majerol, the editor of Shop Talk. Journalists, she added, typically edit articles to avoid jargon that doesn't elicit meaning to readers. In conceiving of the column, Ms. Majerol said she, along with other editors, reporters and designers, wondered, "What if the jargon could become the story itself?"
Since October, Shop Talk has explored the usage of terms like dogfooding, "friendshoring" and "trendjacked," and examined why they catch on. By revealing how the people in business talk about business, the team hopes to help readers understand the cultural forces that shape large companies.
The column, which runs every two weeks, is open to all reporters who encounter unusual words and idioms on their beats. Last month, for example, Niraj Chokshi, who covers the airline industry, defined "completion factor" as an industry term for the percentage of flights an airline does not cancel. In the most recent Shop Talk column, the Culture reporter Brooks Barnes walked readers through a "four quadrant," a movie that appeals to young and old, men and women alike.
Jordyn Holman, who covers retail for The Times, said she was constantly translating jargon in her head while reporting. Last fall, Ms. Holman noticed the trend of retailers dubbing their customers anything but customers. At Target, they were called "guests." At Sephora, they were "clients." And at Dick's Sporting Goods, they were "athletes."
Why go to such great lengths to find a new label for a customer? To engender loyalty, Ms. Holman found. By calling customers something personal, retailers thought shoppers would feel special. "As reporters we want to say: 'This is what they're actually saying,' " she said.
While decoding phrases, reporters are also reading between the lines to find what executives are trying not to say. For example, a high "completion factor" sounds nice, but it doesn't account for flight delays. Ms. Kelley's jargon radar sounded when she read a LinkedIn post written by an executive announcing layoffs at her company. The executive used the term "go forward" to describe a specific pool of employees. Ms. Kelley understood the euphemism: the employees "going forward" were spared from layoffs.
"Language can be a tool for keeping things opaque to outsiders," Ms. Kelley said. "This column is one way to show people what's going on inside a closed off world."
Business idioms are often made up and coded within a specific industry, and it's a challenge to produce a definition of a term that can't be found in the dictionary. To arrive at a consensus, journalists scan the web, news releases and company reports for mentions of the word or phrase, as well as interview employees, experts and academic authorities on various industries.
"We want to find people using the term in the wild," Ms. Kelley said.
Decoding jargon isn't just a written effort, though. Ms. Majerol and Minh Uong, Shop Talk's art director, work with illustrators to help bring each term to life visually. The column's illustrations "do not just describe the word, but put it in context through a visual situation," Mr. Uong said.
To illustrate "completion factor," Mr. Uong and Ms. Majerol decided on an illustration of a contrail shaped like a smiley face. After all, any traveler can relate to the joy of a flight gone right, Mr. Uong said.
And if you're stuck in a frustrating delay, you'll know that the airline is still counting on a completion.
Readers can nominate a word or term by writing to shoptalk@nytimes.com.

Some Are Scanning for Hints of Trouble: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Our reporter took a five-mile walk around Manhattan to find businesses that are using facial recognition technology.
In early February, I spent $ 171.59 to see the Rangers play the Canucks at Madison Square Garden. I had no plans to watch the hockey game. I just wanted to find out whether my guest, Tia Garcia, a personal injury lawyer, could get into the building.
We got in the security line and walked through the metal detector. Then, as Ms. Garcia turned to pick up her bag from the conveyor belt, a security guard asked her to step aside and show her driver's license. "Am I in trouble?" she asked.
The guard told her that she would need to wait for management to come speak to her.
He didn't explain why, but we already knew: Ms. Garcia is one of thousands of lawyers on a ban list because their firms are involved in litigation against the arena's parent company. While we were in line, facial recognition technology identified her.
"Have you been here before?" the guard asked. When Ms. Garcia told him that she had seen the Cavaliers play the Knicks a few weeks earlier, he expressed surprise. That time, Ms. Garcia had worn a medical mask, a hat and glasses. This time, her face was clearly visible.
Five minutes later, the security manager arrived to officially kick Ms. Garcia out. Even though she had expected it to happen, Ms. Garcia found the deployment of facial recognition technology to punish corporate enemies alarming. So did local lawmakers. The City Council convened a hearing last month to discuss how Madison Square Garden and other local businesses were using the technology.
There were lots of questions to be asked: Who is using it? Who are the people they're trying to keep out of their businesses? What do they do when the technology gets it wrong and flags a look-alike? Mayor Eric Adams had recently encouraged businesses to use facial recognition to fight shoplifting. Who answered his call? If you shoplift once, are you barred for life?
But the Council had a problem. Madison Square Garden hadn't sent a representative, as requested. (A spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden said the organization thought its view -- that the technology provides a safe and secure environment -- was represented by others there.)
And no one at the hearing knew which other businesses were using the technology.
So I decided to find out. New York City has a quirky new law that makes it the only municipality in the country where a business scanning faces has to post a sign telling customers that it is doing so. After I left the meeting, I set off on a miles-long walk in search of those signs. They weren't where I expected them to be.
A Privacy Walkabout
I left the hearing in Lower Manhattan and walked south, past the clothing retailer Zara and a CVS. Neither had a "biometric identifier information" disclosure, so presumably they weren't using facial recognition technology.
"Biometric identifiers? What's that?" an employee at the CVS door asked when I told him about the sign I was seeking. "Biometric identifier" is a fancy term for a unique physical trait, such as a fingerprint, a voiceprint or a scan of someone's face.
Facial recognition software is typically trained on photos of millions of people, until it learns what to look for in an image to match one face to another. It is not perfect, but has grown more accurate in recent years thanks to advances in artificial intelligence.
Typically, a store using facial recognition technology isn't trying to identify every customer who walks through the door but rather is looking for faces that have been put on a watch list, such as previous shoplifters. Madison Square Garden has said it created its lawyer watch list by collecting faces from the barred firms' websites.
I walked a few more blocks south to what I thought would be a sure bet for such a sign: Amazon Go, a convenience store where customers can pay with a palm print. The store was awash in cameras, sensors and palm scanners, allowing shoppers to pick up items and simply walk out without needing to stop at a register. There was a prominent display about the "power in your palm," with instructions on how to link one's handprint to an Amazon account.
But even this store did not have what I was looking for. Amazon said that facial recognition technology wasn't used and that it collected biometrics only from people who volunteered their palms. I bought some mediocre sushi and some water, but with a code from my Amazon app, as I wasn't quite ready to give Jeff Bezos my handprint.
Only the human kind used here
I made my way north toward the New York Times building in Midtown Manhattan, crossing Canal Street to walk along the distinctive cobblestone streets of SoHo. I popped into a Ralph Lauren where a blue cotton blazer was $ 790, a Sunglass Hut selling Gucci glasses for $ 550 and a Louis Vuitton with a $ 990 sleeveless crop top. None of them had a biometric sign, only many employees who watched me closely.
At Coach, a greeter standing next to high-end purses said that the store didn't use facial recognition technology, but that he and his fellow employees knew the regular shoplifters by face and would crowd the door when they tried to enter.
"Try Sephora," he suggested. I did, but there was no sign there. Nor at the Apple, Target or Adidas stores nearby.
The Pew Research Center recently surveyed Americans about their views on facial recognition technology, but only its use by the police, which slightly fewer than half called a good idea. The New York City Police Department has been using the technology since 2011. Less is known about its use by the private sector beyond Madison Square Garden, which started using its system in 2018 to identify security threats.
I walked up the Avenue of the Americas toward Chelsea, passing Old Navy, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Trader Joe's and Best Buy. None of them had a biometric disclosure sign.
The city law that requires the notice went into effect last year. The penalty for failure to post a sign is $ 500, but the law also prohibits businesses from selling or sharing the biometric information they collect, with damages of up to $ 5,000 per violation. Private individuals are responsible for enforcing the law; consumers would need to figure out that a business without a sign was secretly scanning their faces or sharing their faceprints with others, and then sue.
"We suspect many businesses are still unaware of the N.Y.C. biometrics law," said Mark Francis, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight who focuses on data privacy.
'Stop grocery store violence and theft'
As I crossed 25th Street, and the pedometer on my iPhone hit nearly 14,000 steps, I finally spotted a sign at the gourmet grocer Fairway Market. A flimsy white piece of paper, titled "Biometric Identifier Information Disclosure," was taped to a sliding-glass door.
"They use it for security, if people steal," a Fairway employee told me. The store, he said, used a vendor called FaceFirst; its website promises to "stop grocery store violence and theft." The employee, who asked not to be identified by name because he wasn't authorized to speak to a reporter, said a man had been kicked out just that morning because he had previously stolen coffee.
Retail theft has been on the rise since the pandemic. Karen O'Shea, a spokeswoman for Wakefern, Fairway's parent company, said the facial recognition system was put in place about a year ago.
"Retail theft and shoplifting has a high rate of repeat offense and drives up grocery costs for all customers," she said. "Only trained asset protection associates use the system, which helps us focus attention on repeat shoplifters."
After leaving Fairway, I ran into more signs just eight blocks away. When I walked into Macy's on 34th Street, two fancy white signs were affixed to the gray marble wall, one in English and one in Spanish, informing customers that their "biometric identifier information" was collected for "asset protection purposes."
A security guard said he didn't know whether facial recognition was used there. "What signs? Where?" he said, looking around, seemingly confused.
Macy's did not respond to requests for comment about the signs, but a spokesperson previously told Insider that the company used facial recognition "in a small subset of stores with high incidences of organized retail theft and repeat offenders."
Help!
Macy's was just a block from Madison Square Garden, so I swung by to confirm its signs were still on display on poles near the metal detectors. The last six blocks of my trek, past restaurants and retailers on Eighth Avenue, had no obvious biometric signage.
The findings from my four-hour walkabout were confounding. I had checked dozens of stores. The high-end retailers of SoHo apparently weren't using the cutting-edge technology to protect their expensive apparel, but Fairway Market, with lemons on sale for 99 cents, was. Either we are in the early days of the technology's deployment or it is not proving as popular with retailers as expected.
My journey was a limited survey of a vast city of many blocks. Walking the whole of it would take something like six years. So, dear reader, I request help. If you are wandering the streets of New York City and spot a biometric identifier information disclosure sign, I invite you to take a photograph, record the location and send it to me at kashmir.hill@nytimes.com. My feet thank you.

Glossier Moves to Extend Its Reach: [Style Desk]

Full text: Founded almost a decade ago, the millennial beauty start-up takes a big step with a hyped SoHo flagship.
On a Saturday afternoon in late January, a stretch of North Sixth Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn looked as if the internet had physically manifested itself. Direct-to-consumer brands like Everlane, Brooklinen, Interior Define, Parachute Home and Gorjana are interspersed here between the giants: Nike, H&M, Patagonia and Lululemon.
Only Glossier, purveyor of youthful beauty products, had a line outside.
"When we were walking over here, we noticed the girls holding the pink bags," said Eva Kemal, 22, a health-care consultant who was standing next to a You Look Good selfie mirror with Audrey Pooser, a college friend. "It's just so much of an aesthetic." Ms. Kemal's nails matched the pink Glossier shopping bags (a coincidence).
"It's very much an aesthetic," Ms. Pooser, 23, chimed in. A longtime Boy Brow and Cloud Paint fan, she picked up a "special occasion product" -- a red lip gloss. "I appreciate that they make the checkout aspect collaborative once you have tested the products, and picking up the pink bag felt like a reward."
Robyn Rapaport, 25, is another Gen Z-er who made the trip to the Glossier store because of the "aesthetic."
"It's very aesthetically pleasing," Ms. Rapaport said from outside the store, where she waited with five friends in a line of about 40 people. Glossier's Milky Jelly Cleanser, a pandemic discovery, has been part of Ms. Rapaport's skin-care routine for nearly three years.
On Friday, the Glossier aesthetic is heading to Spring Street in SoHo, where the brand's flagship will be around the block from the restaurant Jack's Wife Freda on Lafayette Street -- another place people love to wait in line in extreme New York City weather, except for rosewater waffles, not rose-flavored Balm Dotcom.
The new store is a selfie palace, a Gen Z beauty Disneyworld and homage to New York's efficient yet sometimes unreliable subway system. There is a 500-square-foot lounge that's bigger than most stores downtown, outfitted with a larger-than-life facsimile of the Glossier You solid perfume, thumbprint and all.
During a tour of the new space, Emily Weiss, the founder and executive chairwoman of Glossier, and Marie Suter, the company's executive creative director, floated around the shop. They pointed out banquet tables for displaying eyeliner and lipstick, and a wet bar where one can make an appointment. (Imagine Apple's Genius Bar, but for makeup or skin-care services.)
An old-school carnival claw machine gives players a chance to win G-shaped cookie cutters, hair clips and more, and an area called a gift shop is stocked with merch, current and of years' past back by popular demand, like a 2022 beach bag from the Miami store. The flagship has its own exclusive black hoodie (so New York!), and $ 5 from each sale will be donated to the Sadie Nash Leadership Project, which seeks to equip young women with leadership skills.
The pièce de résistance, a floor-to-ceiling New York City subway-style mosaic, was made by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios with tiles imported from Italy. It's the same workshop behind the tiled murals in some of the city's subway stations, including Roy Lichtenstein's Pop Art in Times Square and the sea turtles and jaguars at the Museum of Natural History stop on 81st Street. At Glossier, white, red and pink tiles are fashioned into roses, orchids and a tube of Ultralip lipstick. Naturally, "You Look Good" is etched into the mosaic and faces a mirror, begging you to take a selfie.
In keeping with the subway theme, MetroCard machines in five stations will spew out Glossier-branded MetroCards printed with red lipsticks. On Friday, pink-jumpsuit-clad store and corporate employees will hand out pink roses to subway riders at the Spring Street station.
"Glossier literally defined a category -- the millennial, direct-to-consumer beauty brand," said Lucie Greene, a trend forecaster and founder of the Light Years consultancy.
From Millennials to Gen Z
Glossier was introduced in 2014 with more expensive than drugstore but still affordable moisturizer, skin tint, face mist and a multiuse salve, Balm Dotcom. Every purchase came with cute stickers and matching pink Bubble Wrap (the oft-mentioned "aesthetic").
The brand sold the idea of "being you, but better" and enhancing your natural features with barely-there makeup and moist, plump skin. Glossier models were diverse, a concept that today seems obvious, but a decade ago felt novel. Ms. Weiss was speaking to Gen Z before Gen Z knew she was even speaking to them.
Things haven't always been so rosy -- er, millennial pink -- for Glossier. In recent years, the brand stuck to its digital-first roots, focusing on its technology rather than innovating its products. But the novelty of being a direct-to-consumer brand wore off. Fans just wanted to buy Glossier in a store nearby, which was impossible if you didn't live in New York or Los Angeles.
In 2019, its sister brand Glossier Play, a line of lacquered, sparkly makeup that anticipated the "Euphoria" makeup trend, misfired on all fronts. The collection didn't resonate, and the products' excess packaging spurred a prickly discourse: unsustainability. Customer frustration mounted.
Glossier Play was discontinued after a year. In 2021, Glossier's U.S. sales were down 26 percent from the previous year, according to data from Bloomberg Second Measure. Its troubles were much publicized, including complaints, in 2020, of racism, highlighted by an Instagram account called Outta the Gloss. The company apologized on Instagram, saying it had not created an "inclusive, safe environment."
Ms. Weiss, 37, said she had a "penny drop" moment in 2021 while reading TikTok comments. "The top three things people were asking us for, loud and clear, were, 'Why aren't you available in Ulta or Sephora?' 'Why don't you ship to my country?' and 'Can you please make new products?"' (Glossier's site currently ships only to a handful of countries outside the United States and Canada.)
Glossier spent much of 2022 regrouping. The company laid off about a third of its work force in January; Ms. Weiss stepped down in May; and Kyle Leahy, formerly the chief commercial officer, stepped into the chief executive role. Ms. Leahy oversaw a corporate restructuring and departure from the brand's core business model, which until this year has been selling only on its website and in its stores. In July of last year, Glossier announced it would sell its products at Sephora.
The Sephora debut is one week away, a new website is scheduled to go live in April (with shipping to more countries to come), and there's a higher number of products dropping this year. Instead of roughly four launches per year, Glossier will introduce new items every four to six weeks, from shade add-ons to Cloud Paint to entirely new products like deodorant. Stores in Boston and Chicago will open in the spring.
"We started as a millennial brand," Ms. Leahy said. "We were founded as a direct-to-consumer business. We are beyond that. We are bigger than that because we can now resonate with Gen Z."
According to Kleo Mack, the senior vice president for global marketing at Glossier, the idea for a recent Balm Dotcom charm event came from a TikTok post in which someone put a charm on their balm.
"We sent them a DM and said: 'This is so cute, so amazing. How did you come up with this?"' Ms. Mack said.
Earlier this month, Glossier reintroduced its Balm Dotcom with an updated, Gen Z-friendly vegan formula and a new applicator tip. The company sold $ 1 million worth of the multipurpose balm in the first week, it said.
Glossier expects its sales to rise significantly this year; in 2021 the company raised $ 80 million from investors, giving it a valuation of $ 1.8 billion.
From Online to I.R.L. Shopping
On Feb. 23, every Sephora in the United States and Canada -- approximately 600 stores -- will be outfitted in millennial pink, including six-foot-long displays of Glossier's greatest hits (Boy Brow, Glossier You fragrance and Milky Jelly Cleanser) and posters with drippy tubes of pink Cloud Paint taking over all front windows. Tables of blush and perfume will be placed at each entryway, and Balm Dotcom stations near cash registers will carry all nine flavors, including Wild Fig, a limited edition from 2020 that Glossier just brought back.
"We have so much history in terms of what works for the brand, and so we're going in with more knowledge than pretty much any other brand we've ever launched," said Artemis Patrick, the global chief merchandising officer of Sephora.
At this time 10 years ago, Ms. Weiss was shopping around a new idea: a website that would sell beauty products, and eventually body care and fragrance. She convinced investors (mostly male at the time, according to Ms. Weiss) that millennials like herself would buy these items online from a brand they'd never heard of -- or even tested first.
The concept was a continuation of the beauty website Into the Gloss, the blueprint and feedback loop Ms. Weiss started in 2011 that would help shape Glossier. On the site, industry insiders, "it" girls and celebrities often detailed their most unhinged and unrelatable beauty routines. Once, Lauren Santo Domingo, a founder of Moda Operandi, doled out shampoo recommendations with this disclaimer: "Not like I wash my own hair, I can't even remember the last time I washed my own hair." The posts were addictive and aspirational.
Eventually, selling only to consumers online and in select cities went from an early advantage to a hindrance. The "community first" company was no longer serving the community.
"There's a point in the scaling of a business where it becomes too big to not have to introduce some processes, and that can be really disruptive to the existing culture," Shireen Jiwan, the founder and chief executive of Sleuth Brand Consulting, said of Glossier's growing pains. "It can offend people on the inside, offend people on the outside -- and it brings leadership scrutiny."
Isn't that what always happens when David becomes Goliath, or in the case of Glossier, when the start-up becomes the incumbent?
"Before, it was just a microcosm of girls in New York who were downtown going to the Lafayette store," Ms. Weiss said. "Now Glossier's global, it's nationwide, it's in every Sephora store."
