Full text: The accusations reflect worry in Washington that China's information operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States.
The State Department accused China on Thursday of using "deceptive and coercive methods" to shape the global information environment, by acquiring stakes in foreign newspapers and television networks, using major social media platforms to promote its views and exerting pressure on international organizations and media outlets to silence critics of Beijing.
The accusations, detailed in a report by the department's Global Engagement Center, reflect worry in Washington that China's information operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States and to democratic principles around the world by promoting "digital authoritarianism."
China not only pushes its own propaganda, the report said, but exports digital surveillance tools to police information and people online. Although many of the tactics detailed are not new, the report warned that they could "lead nations to make decisions that subordinate their economic and security interests to Beijing."
"Every country has the right and every right to tell its story to the world, but a nation's narrative should be facts, and it should rise or fall on its own merits," James P. Rubin, the coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, said at a briefing. Referring to the People's Republic of China, he went on: "By contrast, the P.R.C. advances coercive techniques and increasingly outright lies."
The report echoes a raft of recent studies detailing the growing -- and shifting -- scope of China's information campaigns. It came a day after officials disclosed in a Senate briefing that Chinese hackers who gained access to the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other officials this year stole 60,000 emails from the State Department alone.
According to the State Department's report released on Thursday, China's efforts have evolved from a primary focus on promoting or defending the country's political views on issues like Taiwan and Hong Kong to one that aims to sow disinformation to discredit the United States at home and abroad.
That has included accusations about the origins of the Covid pandemic, the new security partnership between the United States and Australia, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, disclosed last month that it had dismantled a Chinese campaign using more than 8,000 accounts, pages or groups on the two platforms, the largest inauthentic network it had found so far. Microsoft and other researchers also linked China to the spread of false claims about the causes of the deadly wildfires in Hawaii.
That campaign included images generated by artificial intelligence, a tool that the researchers, like the State Department, warn could greatly enhance China's efforts.
China's control over information internally is virtually absolute, but increasingly it is expanding its influence abroad, with its state channels broadcasting in 12 languages.
The report said that China has spent billions of dollars to build an expansive state news operation under the Central Propaganda Department and the United Front Work Department, which the report said oversees investments in foreign media aimed at Chinese diaspora communities.
The report cited investments in media organizations in the Czech Republic, Australia and Thailand, where Tencent sidestepped a law against foreign ownership to acquire Sanook, the country's most popular news site.
China has also become a leading provider in digital television services in Africa through StarTimes, a Chinese company that now reaches most of the continent's viewers.
While the department's report was based largely on public information, it included references to knowledge seemingly based on classified information.
That included "U.S. government information" about an agreement with a newspaper "in an East African country" to publish paid articles from China without disclosing the connection and the fact that until at least late 2020, ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, maintained "a regularly updated internal list" of people who were blocked or restricted on the platform.
The report also detailed what it described as a fictitious author, Yi Fan, whose writings in English have appeared in publications around the world since 2015 under bylines describing him as an independent analyst.
China has also become adept at using social media platforms that the authorities banned inside the country's Great Firewall. China now operates 333 diplomatic or official media accounts on Twitter, now known as X, with nearly 65 million followers, according to the report.
Those official accounts, it added, were bolstered by networks of bots and inauthentic accounts. From June 2020 to January 2021, a single network of those accounts impersonating British citizens accounted for 44 percent of the retweets and 20 percent of the replies to posts by Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador at the time and one of the outspoken "wolf warriors" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"Although more than half of Liu's retweets during this period came from accounts that were ultimately suspended for violating Twitter's terms of service at the time," the report said, "new accounts continued to pop up to prolong this inauthentic amplification." Twitter has since dropped the labels that identified foreign government accounts.
China uses similar accounts to stifle criticism. The report noted that more than 1,000 fake accounts sought to drown out a report last year by Safeguard Defenders, a human rights organization, that detailed the undisclosed presence of Chinese police officers in 53 countries. The campaign used accounts with the same name as the organization in what appeared to be an effort to trigger Twitter's policy to de-emphasize inauthentic campaigns.
The State Department's Global Engagement Center was established in 2011 with a focus on countering terrorism and violent extremism. In 2017 Congress extended its mandate to focus on propaganda and disinformation.
The impact of China's effort can be difficult to measure, and the report suggests that the Chinese campaigns often encounter resistance in other countries. The country's Communist Party appears committed, however, to reshaping the international environment suited to its political goals.
"We have every reason to believe that will continue," said Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga, a researcher at the RAND Corporation and a co-author of a recent report on China's reliance on artificial intelligence to bolster its information operations. "They're more likely to double down than they are to stop."

Nobody Ever Won an Oscar for 'Content': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The term may be popular in an age of blurring lines between platforms, but the Hollywood strikes have shown how the phrase can devalue creative work.
Over the past couple of years, I've spent a disproportionate amount of time thinking about a scene from the 1986 Rodney Dangerfield vehicle "Back to School." He stars as Thornton Melon, a self-made millionaire entrepreneur who, per the title, returns to finish his university education alongside his freshman son. On the first day of his intro to business course, Professor Philip Barbay (Paxton Whitehead) explains that they'll spend the semester creating and running a fictional manufacturing company. "What's the product?" asks the pragmatic Melon, who won't let the point drop.
"Let's just say they're widgets," snaps the professor.
"What's a widget?" asks Melon.
"It's a fictional product," Barbay replies. "It doesn't matter."
At some point a few years back, an unholy union of like-minded tech bros, studio suits, media water-carriers and social media personalities settled on their own "widget," a catchall phrase that would both encompass and minimize the various forms of entertainment they touch: "content." And when news broke on Sunday night that the monthslong Writers Guild of America strike was coming to an end, Variety, the industry bible, gave this term its most skin-crawling deployment to date, noting that the W.G.A. strike had taken "a heavy toll across the content industry."
"No, absolutely not," tweeted the TV writer and comedian Mike Drucker. "We're not calling it 'the content industry' now, you psychopaths."
In fact, Variety itself had run, just a few days earlier, a pointed rebuke to the term from no less an authority than the Oscar-winning actor and screenwriter Emma Thompson. "To hear people talk about 'content' makes me feel like the stuffing inside a sofa cushion," she said at the Royal Television Society conference in Britain last week.
"It's just a rude word for creative people," she added. "I know there are students in the audience: You don't want to hear your stories described as 'content' or your acting or your producing described as 'content.' That's just like coffee grounds in the sink or something."
Thompson's not only right about the implications of the phrasing. She's right about the real-world impact of what is, make no mistake, a devaluing of the creative process. Those who defend its use will insist that we need some kind of catchall phrase for the things we watch, as previously crisp lines have blurred between movies and television, between home and theatrical exhibition and between legacy and social media.
But these paradigm shifts require more clarity in our language, not less. A phrase like "streaming movie" or "theatrical release" or "documentary podcast" communicates what, where and why with far more precision than gibberish like "content," and if you want to put everything under one tent, "entertainment" is right there. But studio and streaming executives, who are perhaps the primary users and abusers of the term, love to talk about "content" because it's so wildly diminutive. It's a quick and easy way to minimize what writers, directors and actors do, to act as though entertainment (or, dare I say it, art) is simply churned out -- and could be churned out by anyone, sentient or not. It's just content, it's just widgets, it's all grist for the mill. Talking about "entertainment" is dangerous because it takes talent to entertain; no such demands are made of "content," and the industry's increasing interest in the possibilities of writing via artificial intelligence (one of the sticking points of the writers' strike) makes that crystal clear.
Perhaps the finest example of this school of thought can be seen at Warner Bros. Discovery, where David Zaslav ascended to the throne of chief executive by overseeing the Discovery Channel's transition from nature documentaries to reality swill. The "content"-ization of that conglomerate's holdings is the only reasonable explanation for the decision to rename HBO Max as simply Max -- removing the prestigious legacy media brand that most clearheaded, marginally intelligent people would presume to be an asset. It lost 1.8 million subscribers in the process, but that's merely the battle; it won the war, because when you visit Max now, the front-page carousel is a combination of scripted series, HBO documentaries, true crime and reality competition shows. It's all on equal footing; it's all content. But "Casablanca," "Succession" and "Dr. Pimple Popper" are not the same thing -- and the programmers of a service that pretends otherwise are abdicating their responsibility as curators.
The service also showed its hand with the baffling decision (later corrected, following threats from the writers' and directors' unions) to lump together all of a production's writers, producers and directors under the single classification of "creators" -- terminology that similarly attempts to simplify and minimize the hard work of writing and directing, while simultaneously elevating the wildly divergent efforts of social media personalities and Instagram influencers who will breathlessly brand themselves "content creators." You'll hear tech "geniuses" and "innovative" chief executives referring to showrunners and filmmakers with the same terminology, and it's nonsensical. Martin Scorsese and Logan Paul are not in the same line of work. In practical terms, "content creator" neatly accomplishes two things at once: It lets people who make garbage think they're making art, and tells people who make art that they're making garbage.
Perhaps this is all just semantics, an old man yelling at clouds about a shift in thinking and classification. But the ubiquity of "content" is no organic evolution; this is more complicated, and frankly more depressing, than that. Language matters. The way we talk about things affects how we think and feel about them. So when journalists regurgitate purposefully reductive language, and when their viewers and readers consume and parrot it, they're not adopting some zippy buzzword. They're doing the bidding of people in power, and diminishing the work that they claim to love.

From Hungry and Broke in the East Village: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Living in the neighborhood in the 1980s and '90s, I was always hungry and always broke. I got pretty far on that combination.
Hi, it's Pete Wells, restaurant critic of The Times and longtime pierogi appreciator.
It would be an exaggeration to say that I moved to the East Village for the pierogies. This was 1988, and rents were still low east of the Bowery.
Still, the pierogies did whisper in my ear. Before my move to New York City I'd made a lot of weekend visits to friends who lived in the East Village. After scratching the cue ball at Julian's or dancing at the Pyramid Club, we'd end the night at one of the Eastern European restaurants that used to be thick on the ground. (The best scene was at the Kiev, on Second Avenue, where you might spot Allen Ginsberg or Quentin Crisp or Jonas Mekas.) Dragging one corner of a pierogi through mounds of fried onions and sour cream, I thought: This would be an interesting place to live.
I was right. The East Village was my home for most of the next 12 years. I was always ready to eat something new, and I was always broke. You could go pretty far on that combination in the '80s and '90s. I found Egyptian grilled chicken, Filipino chicken adobo, Sicilian spleen sandwiches on palm-size seeded buns, Awadhi stews steamed under a lid of pastry, and a hundred other things.
I thought I was getting dinner, but I was getting an education. Many of the places I loved then are gone, but not all. Here are some of the survivors, the restaurants where I used to go on my own dime before I turned pro.
Little Poland
The old Polish and Ukrainian coffee shops weren't always known for nuance. Little Poland's cooking, though, has a subtlety that sets it apart, even from two other survivors that I love, Veselka and the Ukrainian East Village Restaurant. The challah at Little Poland, unbraided and only slightly sweet, is springier and moister than some others. You could almost call its cold borscht, swimming with chopped cucumbers and eggs and beets, a Polish gazpacho. The potato pancakes crackle under your fork and the blintzes, which stretch from one end of the plate to the other, are as evenly browned as if they had spent the summer on the Algarve, lying on a reflective blanket.
Curry Ya x Rai Rai Ken x Otafuku
In the '80s and '90s, the neighborhood started to attract young Japanese bohemians. While Midtown had staid Japanese restaurants for men in suits, the East Village got street food and noodle counters. The first time I saw balls of takoyaki with leaves of shaved bonito fluttering miraculously on top was at Otafuku, on East 9th Street. And while I had left the neighborhood by the time Curry Ya opened on East 10th Street, it's where I ate my first katsu curry. Both restaurants are gone now but their menus, and many of their fans, have been transferred to Rai Rai Ken, on East 10th, where I had my first bowl of ramen that didn't come out of a packet. All three places are owned by T.I.C. Restaurant Group, which brought at least a dozen genres of Japanese dining and drinking to the East Village starting in the 1980s.
Sunny & Annie's Deli
How many sandwiches has Sunny & Annie's invented? I know there were already more than 100 when I lived across the street, because my favorite was the 101, a mutant Reuben with bacon. Early on almost everything was assembled from deli staples. Now there are many variations on the banh mi, sandwiches that resemble Mexican cemitas and a few that are unclassifiable.
Casa Adela
One of the hubs of the old Loisaida neighborhood is now its most impressive survivor, carrying on in spite of an eroding Hispanic presence, a rent dispute and the death of its founder, Adela Fargas. And so, against the odds, Casa Adela is still there from morning to night with hand-wrapped pasteles, sancocho, roast pork, soupy pots of beans, fried plaintains mashed into mofongo, unaccountably good rotisserie chickens, and fresh orange juice that goes into Adela's marvelous morir soñando.
B & H Dairy Kosher Restaurant
The counter at B & H was where I sat when I was overstimulated. I'd come back down to earth after a whitefish salad on soft fat slices of challah and a bowl of pea soup as thick as pudding.
Stromboli Pizza
It does everything a slice shop should, including staying open an hour after the bars close.
John's of 12th Street
I could rarely afford John's, but when I had the money I would come just to stare at the burning candles emerging from encrustations of wax so long in the making they look positively medieval.
What I'm reading
In The Baffler, Chris Crowley has a cleareyed explanation of why the no-tipping movement fell apart.
Americans don't love their morning bowls of cereal the way they used to. As Aaron Back reports in The Wall Street Journal, cereal sales have been shrinking for years, motivating Kellogg to sell off its North American cereal division as WK Kellogg.
I knew people in Kansas City had strong opinions on barbecue, but I didn't know where Missouri's two United States senators stood on the question until I read Daniel Desrocher's column in the Kansas City Star.

Swift Sends N.F.L. Star Into Another Orbit: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, has won two Super Bowls and hosted "Saturday Night Live." But nothing compares to his brush with the Swift aura.
Three years after Travis Kelce was drafted into the National Football League, the tight end courted 50 contestants, one from each state, for a "Bachelor"-esque dating show on E! Entertainment that drew little notice.
His profile has risen substantially since "Catching Kelce" aired in 2016. He has won two Super Bowls with Kansas City -- catching a touchdown in each -- and earned eight Pro Bowl selections while dabbling as a media personality, hosting a "Saturday Night Live" episode and helming a popular football podcast.
But in terms of maximizing his celebrity, nothing compares to Kelce's brush with the aura of Taylor Swift, a 12-time Grammy winner whose Eras Tour this year has shattered concert records and even registered seismic activity.
Kelce and Swift, both 33, have remained quiet about whether they are friends or a couple, or just two celebrities trying to leverage each other's fame. But fans regularly dissect Swift's dating life and failed relationships, which she has written about in her own songs.
After weeks of speculation about a connection between Kelce and Swift, who broke up with the actor Joe Alwyn this year, she attended Kelce's game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., on Sunday, watching from a luxury suite with his mother as the Chiefs trounced the Chicago Bears. Fox cameras panned to Swift's reaction nearly every time Kelce touched the ball. The singer's devoted swarm of fans also tuned in, with several posting on social media that they were watching football for the first time.
Swift, wearing a red-and-white outfit that matched Kansas City's colors, was then seen leaving the stadium with Kelce.
Despite Kelce's relative fame in the sports world, becoming part of the frenzied conversation around Swift's every move is another ballgame. Kelce now has 3.2 million followers on Instagram. Swift has 273 million.
"This puts him on a completely different plane from where he was as a celebrity," said Daniel Durbin, a professor of communication at the University of Southern California. "This is celebrity on steroids, and it has a powerful impact."
As professional athletes near retirement in their 30s and early 40s, many begin to plot their next career moves. Some become broadcasters, while others turn to Hollywood. LeBron James, the star basketball player, has started his own tequila brand and said he wants to own a team.
That Kelce and Swift were in the same stadium this weekend brought together two fandoms that don't often overlap. A spokesman for Fanatics, the N.F.L.'s official retailer, said that sales of Kelce's jersey had spiked by 400 percent as of Monday.
Coaches and players from across the N.F.L. also took notice.
Bill Belichick, the Patriots coach known for gruff answers to reporters' questions, said on a radio show that "Travis Kelce's had a lot of big catches in his career -- this would be the biggest." The star Cowboys defender Micah Parsons posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that one woman "can change your life!!!"
Celebrity relationships in the N.F.L. are not new, but they are normally reserved for star quarterbacks who touch the ball every play. Russell Wilson married the singer Ciara in 2016; Tom Brady, who won seven Super Bowls, spent 16 years with the model Gisele Bündchen before they divorced last year.
It is rarer, but not impossible, for a tight end to drive the national conversation. But Kelce, propelled by his stylish outfits, trimmed beard and haircut and his charismatic personality, has emerged as one of the N.F.L.'s most marketable stars. Before Swift, his fame had crescendoed because of a candid podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason, the center for the Philadelphia Eagles. (Their relationship was a popular topic before last season's Super Bowl, in which the Chiefs narrowly defeated the Eagles.)
On their weekly podcast, "New Heights," the Kelces discuss their lives as professional athletes and speak with high-profile guests like Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. It was also where the Kelce-Swift story line began.
In July, Travis Kelce said on his podcast that he had wanted to give Swift a friendship bracelet during her concert tour stop in Kansas City, but that she had declined to meet him in order to save her voice. Last week, amid rumors that the celebrities were dating, Kelce confirmed in an ESPN interview only that he had invited Swift to a game.
"I told her that, 'I've seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead. You might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead, and see which one's a little more lit,"' Kelce said.
Whatever happens with Kelce and Swift, the attention could be benefiting them both.
Her concert movie, "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," releases next month, and he is already pursuing a career outside sports. He told The Los Angeles Times this summer that he considered Peyton Manning, the Hall of Fame quarterback and founder of the content company Omaha Productions, a mentor, and he recently signed with the powerful media conglomerate Creative Artists Agency.

U.S. Sues Amazon, Saying It Stifles Rivals Illegally: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon, saying its conduct in its online store and services to merchants illegally stifled competition.
The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon on Tuesday, setting up a long-awaited antitrust fight with the e-commerce giant that could alter the way Americans shop for everything from toilet paper to electronics online.
The 172-page suit, the federal government's most significant challenge to the power of the online store, accused Amazon of protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.
For consumers, that meant "artificially higher prices" as merchants were blocked from selling their products for less on other sites, and a worse shopping experience as Amazon boosted its own products and peppered its search results with ads, the lawsuit said. The retailer's tactics made it impossible for its rivals to compete, the agency and states said.
"A single company, Amazon, has seized control over much of the online retail economy," said the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. "It exploits its monopolies in ways that enrich Amazon but harm its customers: both the tens of millions of American households who regularly shop on Amazon's online superstore and the hundreds of thousands of businesses who rely on Amazon to reach them."
The lawsuit put the influence and reach of Amazon, a $ 1.3 trillion behemoth, squarely in the spotlight after years of mounting scrutiny. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, the onetime upstart online bookseller has grown into a conglomerate with tentacles in retail, Hollywood and the foundational infrastructure of the internet.
Much of the Seattle-based company's power has emanated from its online marketplace, sometimes known as an "everything store" for the range of products it sells and the speed with which it delivers them. Amazon's sway over online commerce has shaped the lives of merchants around the world, set the working conditions for more than one million warehouse workers and pushed the Postal Service to deliver on Sundays.
Now Amazon, which denied the accusations in the lawsuit, has become the latest big tech company to face off against the government over monopoly concerns, just as the Justice Department entered the third week of an antitrust trial challenging Google over its power in online search. The F.T.C. has also brought an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, which owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. Members of Congress have considered legislation to regulate some of the companies' most common business practices.
The new lawsuit pits Amazon directly against Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, in a long-awaited confrontation. She rose to fame as a Yale law student in 2017 when she published a paper arguing that American antitrust laws had failed to adequately stop Amazon from amassing power over its customers, competitors and suppliers. The paper helped kick off a debate about whether U.S. antitrust laws needed to be modernized to rein in tech giants.
David Zapolsky, Amazon's general counsel, said in a statement that the F.T.C. "is wrong on the facts and the law" with the lawsuit, portions of which were heavily redacted. He said the complaint showed that the agency's "focus has radically departed from its mission of protecting consumers and competition."
"If the F.T.C. gets its way, the result would be fewer products to choose from, higher prices, slower deliveries for consumers and reduced options for small businesses -- the opposite of what antitrust law is designed to do," he added.
The F.T.C. asked the court to issue an injunction blocking Amazon from engaging in "unlawful conduct" and raised the possibility of altering the company's structure. But it stopped short of detailing how the court could clip Amazon's dominance, such as breaking apart elements of its business. The agency could become more specific if it succeeded in proving Amazon violated the law.
"If we succeed, competition will be restored and people will benefit from lower prices, greater quality, greater selection as a result," Ms. Khan said of the lawsuit.
In the lawsuit, the F.T.C. said Amazon abused a driver of sales known as the Buy Box -- the valuable space on its website and app that prompts customers to "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart."
If Amazon sees a product available for less elsewhere, it will remove those two buttons and replace them with less enticing language and designs to discourage discounts outside its site, the lawsuit said. The company recognized merchants' sales would "tank" if they lost the Buy Box, the lawsuit said. To survive, sellers kept prices high on other sites, it said.
The lawsuit argued that the company made it hard for merchants to sell across different sites by making them use Amazon's fulfillment and delivery services to be eligible for its Prime benefits, which have millions of subscribers.
Amazon, which generates more than $ 500 billion in annual revenue, has continued growing despite the scrutiny. In the past three years, it bought One Medical, a chain of primary care practices; the Roomba manufacturer iRobot; and the fabled movie studio Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, giving it a major stake in the James Bond franchise. These deals have added to an empire that includes its online superstore, cloud computing services that power wide areas of the web and a streaming service that competes with rivals like Netflix.
The F.T.C.'s competition team began investigating Amazon's business in summer 2019, with no shortage of complaints about the company's business practices from critics and rivals.
By June 2021, when President Biden appointed Ms. Khan to be the F.T.C.'s chair, Amazon had provided the agency with documents and information, a person familiar with the investigation said. Under Ms. Khan's leadership, a new team was formed to run the antitrust inquiry, the person said.
The relationship between Amazon and the F.T.C. has been strained since Ms. Khan took over the agency. Weeks after she was sworn in, Amazon petitioned the agency to have her recused from antitrust matters regarding the company.
Last year, Amazon moved to stop the agency from interviewing Mr. Bezos and Andy Jassy, the company's chief executive, in a separate investigation into its Prime membership practices, accusing the F.T.C. of "harassing" the executives. This June, the F.T.C. sued the company as a result of that investigation, accusing it of violating consumer protection laws by tricking consumers into signing up for its Prime membership program.
With Tuesday's announcement, the F.T.C. joins government agencies around the world that are trying to check Amazon's influence on the economy.
In 2021, the attorney general of the District of Columbia accused Amazon of controlling prices on its website, but a judge dismissed the case last year. A similar, but more robust, case brought by California overcame Amazon's attempt to have it thrown out.
The F.T.C.'s lawsuit also echoes accusations from European Union regulators that caused Amazon to change some of its practices. The company agreed last year to a settlement in Europe that will see it display offers from more merchants on individual product pages, and it earlier eliminated some contractual language that stopped merchants from discounting products elsewhere.
Amazon is also winding down most of its private label brands after they failed to generate substantial consumer traction, a person familiar with the strategy said. In June, it announced it would later this year reopen enrollment for a program that let merchants sell their products as Prime-eligible while handling the deliveries themselves, without using Amazon's warehouses.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon on Tuesday, setting up a long-awaited antitrust fight with the e-commerce giant that could alter the way Americans shop for everything from toilet paper to electronics online.
The 172-page suit, the federal government’s most significant challenge to the power of the online store, accused Amazon of protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.
For consumers, that meant “artificially higher prices” as merchants were blocked from selling their products for less on other sites, and a worse shopping experience as Amazon boosted its own products and peppered its search results with ads, the lawsuit said. The retailer’s tactics made it impossible for its rivals to compete, the agency and states said.
“A single company, Amazon, has seized control over much of the online retail economy,” said the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. “It exploits its monopolies in ways that enrich Amazon but harm its customers: both the tens of millions of American households who regularly shop on Amazon’s online superstore and the hundreds of thousands of businesses who rely on Amazon to reach them.”
The lawsuit put the influence and reach of Amazon, a $1.3 trillion behemoth, squarely in the spotlight after years of mounting scrutiny. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, the onetime upstart online bookseller has grown into a sprawling conglomerate with tentacles in retail, Hollywood and the foundational infrastructure of the internet.

For Delta Forecaster, Data Is Everything: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Aviation meteorologists like Warren Weston connect the dots between severe weather and flight schedules by creating detailed forecasts to help planes and their travelers arrive at destinations safely.
From thunderstorms and limited visibility to scorching temperatures and turbulence, the weather dictates when and where planes can fly. Severe weather is the leading cause of air travel disruptions in the United States.
Aviation meteorologists plan for and around difficult conditions, crafting weather forecasts used to determine the nuances of flights, from altitude to optimal routes. They play an essential role in ensuring travelers get to their destinations safely and efficiently.
Several major domestic carriers, including Delta Air Lines, have in-house meteorologists who monitor global weather 24 hours a day. Delta has 28 meteorologists on staff -- the largest team of any airline, it declares -- who sit in the carrier's Operations and Customer Center, alongside flight dispatchers, customer service agents and hundreds of other staffers, at its headquarters in Atlanta.
In this cavernous and screen-filled room, Warren Weston, Delta's lead meteorologist, recently spoke about the importance of data, the difference between surface weather and upper-air hazards, and how even one degree of temperature can change a flight plan. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
What are your team's main responsibilities?
The team provides weather briefings covering Delta's global operations four times a day.
We write our own forecasts for the 10 main Delta hubs in the United States. One of the things that makes us unique is that we are the sole weather provider for Delta. Sometimes our timing will differ from that of the National Weather Service; we might be calling for a slower changeover from snow to rain, for example. The Weather Service doesn't have to see the people they write these forecasts for, but we have the flight dispatchers right here.
It's a 30-hour forecast updated every six hours. I guess the moral of the story is data, data, data. We rely on government and university models, and then proprietary in-house tools.
What kind of weather conditions are analyzed?
This is completely different than the forecast that you would see on your smartphone app. It is a special aviation forecast giving the dispatchers and the pilots information about variables like wind speed and direction.
We are in two modes here: surface weather and upper air. Surface conditions are visibility, precipitation and clouds. On the upper-air side, we are mostly watching for turbulence, the primary threat. We're also looking for volcanic ash (a rock mixture debris released when a volcano erupts), thunderstorms and tropical storms. Occasionally we have ozone issues.
So flight planning begins with the weather. How are forecasts used?
Our goal is to give enough lead time so dispatchers and other decision makers can make proactive operational decisions, rather than waiting for something to happen.
On our screens, we can see every Delta flight that's in the air. I can see their route, where they're going and exactly which dispatcher is in charge of that flight if we needed to communicate with them.
We update the forecasts hours before flights take off. If anything changes, all we have to do is walk over to the dispatchers to suggest areas to avoid or a different altitude.
We always monitor weather for active flights in the air and adjust our hazard alerts for conditions like turbulence, thunderstorms and volcanic eruptions, based on new data. Dispatchers and pilots can easily reach us mid-flight and we can discuss any weather concerns.
What do you do when bad weather is in the forecast?
Say Thursday looks like it's going to be extra active with thunderstorms over the Northeast. At that point, flight dispatchers and customer service agents can start working on a plan, both for the customers and from an operational perspective -- considering whether they need to send out alerts to the customers because of severe weather, about thinning the flight schedule to lessen delays. They'll allow customers more flexibility to change flights.
The Federal Aviation Administration regulations require us to have an alternate airport in case of emergencies like mechanical problems or customer medical crises. So we also write special forecasts for these alternate areas.
What are the most common types of severe weather causing flight delays or cancellations?
It definitely depends on the region, station and season. Atlanta, New York, Florida and the East Coast are prone to severe thunderstorms in the summer that cause disruptions. Similarly, we see winter weather delays and cancellations in places like Detroit, Minneapolis and Salt Lake due to de-icing and ramp/runway conditions.
If you've got a thunderstorm over the airport, that will prevent you from landing. That's probably the main one; another could be thunderstorms en route. That could cause planes to fly a different and longer route.
Then in winter, with freezing precipitation you have to worry about de-icing the airplane and general airport conditions, like whether the snow plows will be able to keep up with the snowfall. This is outside of Delta's control; you're acting on something that's being handled by the airport authority.
There's so many things that can cause delays, and they all vary based on airline, and they all vary based on city. If we had an inch of snow here in Atlanta, obviously everything comes to a grinding halt. We're just not equipped to handle that type of stuff.
This summer has seen record temperatures. What happens to planes during extreme heat?
When it's really hot, the planes can carry a little bit less weight than they normally would, so that means fewer passengers and less baggage. There are also ramp workers to consider.
Even one degree makes a difference. We know what the problem-points are for all our airports -- whether it's temperatures, thunderstorms or snow on the runway -- and for Las Vegas, if it's hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, every degree over 100 is going to mean about 1,400 pounds off.
What should passengers know about weather and air travel?
Bad weather at another airport can still cause delays for your flight, even if the weather is perfect where you are. Those delays can cascade and cause effects in places where the weather is great.

Police Seized My Rental Car, and Avis Won't Refund Me: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A traveler was visiting family when police impounded her vehicle, saying it had been reported stolen. Why wouldn't Avis give her money back, and why would they rent her a stolen car in the first place?
Dear Tripped Up,
In late May, I flew with my daughter from California to Kennedy International Airport in New York, where I rented a car from Avis and headed to Connecticut for a three-day family visit. On day two, I parked the car in Waveny Park in New Canaan and when I returned, it was gone. The local police told me they had impounded the rental because Avis had reported it stolen to the New York Police Department. I had planned to spend the last day of my trip with my 80-something mother, whom I had not seen for three years because of the pandemic, but had to waste precious hours on hold with Avis's customer service department. They eventually offered me a new car but I was unable to coordinate picking it up, so we ended up relying on my sisters to get around. I was only able to spend a few hours with my mom and had to take a $ 100 Uber back to the airport. I asked Avis not to charge me for the rental, but they did, $ 653, and when I disputed the charge with Capital One, Avis fought me. I can't believe Avis is renting out cars they have reported stolen, and then charging its clients. Can you help? Lorraine, El Dorado Hills, Calif.
Dear Lorraine,
It is very frustrating that Avis did not quickly issue you a refund or, even better, go out of its way to get you a new car. But my reporting shows that the real question is not whether Avis is "renting out cars they have reported stolen" -- it's whether they knew the previous renter had reported it stolen and still somehow gave it to you.
Through Edelman, a public relations firm, Avis sent me a statement from Beth Gibson, the company's vice president for customer experience. In it, Ms. Gibson said Avis apologized to you and has now refunded the rental cost, and implied that the company had not known the rental was reported stolen.
"We regret that the refund did not occur more expeditiously. Avis only reports to authorities as a last resort and has comprehensive safeguards in place to prevent erroneous or premature theft notifications," the statement continued, then it noted that the car rented to Lorraine "was reported stolen by a previous renter without our prior knowledge, which caused our customer's rental car to be towed."
What did the two police forces involved have to say? A statement I received from the New York Police Department at least partially backs up Avis's story: On Friday, May 26, at 8:17 p.m., "a 42-year-old female" reported that she had earlier "parked her car in front of 277 Beach 87th Street" and later returned to find the vehicle was "missing."
That Beach 87th Street address, in Queens, is cater-corner to Rockaway Beach's Tacoway Beach, a food stand that serves "the taco that changed Rockaway," according to a 2019 report in these very pages. So I suppose it is possible that this driver, on a Memorial Day weekend beach getaway, stopped for a taco and forgot where she parked and called the N.Y.P.D. to report the car stolen. Following this line of thinking, she later found the car but did not un-report the incident, and didn't talk to Avis at any point during the night.
The N.Y.P.D. would not provide the full report, so I could not contact the previous renter. Nor would Avis give me her name, so it's possible that she never once told the rental company she had reported the car stolen.
But that story is in conflict with the New Canaan police report you provided and which the town's chief of police, John DiFederico, confirmed was genuine. According to that police report, the New Canaan lieutenant you spoke with called Avis's Law Enforcement Hotline, where she spoke to a representative named Julio. Julio "confirmed the vehicle was reported stolen" and said Avis "had rented it to Lorraine without first contacting N.Y.P.D. to cancel" the stolen vehicle notification. If true, that would mean Avis knew the car had been reported stolen. Avis's statement does not tell us when the company learned the car had been stolen, and the company has twice declined to answer my follow-up questions about timing. The company did add that they would have never rented the car to you if they had "been made aware."
Whatever really happened, a note for travelers: If you believe your rental car has been stolen, you should report it to the police and then to the rental car company. If you then find your rental car on, say, the next block, you should report it un-stolen to both entities.
There is another conflict between Avis's statement and your story. You told me you had not received an apology, and that the only message you got from the company was from a senior manager of customer advocacy who called and left a voice message. You forwarded it to me, and when I played it back, it was clear the manager neither offered an apology nor accepted any fault on behalf of the company, merely saying he had information to share and asking you to call back. (You told me you called him back once and left a message, but as of my deadline you two have apparently not connected.)
Through Edelman, Avis told me that they had in fact sent an email apology on Aug. 31 at 6:17 p.m. to the wrong email address. (They were off by one letter.) Avis declined to forward me a copy, and you said you never received it -- even if the address was fixed and email resent.
You were just as outraged by Avis's reaction when you told them your car had been seized, and on that count I agree. Avis's customer service team should have recognized its error and gone out of their way to get you a new car as soon as possible, rather than provide you with what you said were untenable options to pick up a new car. At the very least they should have refunded you right away.
The Avis statement was also imprecise in characterizing their action as a simple "refund." In fact, in a follow-up statement, the company said they "accepted the charge-back from the bank and processed the refund," meaning they have given up on their initial effort to fight your credit card issuer.
I am frustrated that I could not fully get to the bottom of the story and determine who here was at fault, either solely our 42-year-old (alleged) taco enthusiast or also Avis. In fact, I filed a request for additional information through the N.Y.P.D.'s Freedom of Information Law unit. That might take months, though if there's any interesting new developments, I'll post them on social media.
But you did get your money back, and that's something.

Full text: Women are asking the men in their lives how often they think about ancient Rome. Their responses, posted online, can be startling in their frequency.
The Roman Empire began in 27 B.C. and fell in A.D. 476.
And in A.D. 2023, it went viral on TikTok.
In posts shared on social media, women have been asking the men in their lives how often they think about ancient Rome. "Constantly," one husband responded. "Like, every day," said a boyfriend. As of Thursday night, a thread on X, formerly known as Twitter, went on like this for MDCLXXIX messages. (Sorry, that's 1,679.)
The posts have set off skepticism over whether men are actually obsessed with the Romans -- and if so, what draws them to the ancient empire. It appears that the populus will not rest without answers.
"I'm starting to get sick of being asked about this," said Kevin Feeney, a faculty fellow at New York University who teaches an introductory class on Roman history. By his estimation, enrollment is about 60 percent male.
Ancient Roman society was "extremely, extremely patriarchal," he said, and was dominated by such alpha males as Julius Caesar and Augustus, its first emperor.
But that's far from the whole story of Rome, or of its scholars, he added. Roman society influences everything from the United States' form of government to its language to its architecture (right down to the prefix "arch," which, as it happens, is also a structure popularized by the Romans).
Its history has been dissected by scholars including Mary Beard, the author of the 2015 book "SPQR." Ms. Beard declined to comment because she is off filming. In Rome.
Dr. Feeney said he had "seen this idea out there that men care more about history," as a result of the social media trend. "And obviously, that's complete nonsense."
Still, many women have been shocked by the enthusiasm men display for the ancient empire.
The trend seemed to really take off last week after Kelsey Lewis Vincent of Wilson, N.C., was scrolling through social media one night when she came across an Instagram Reel mysteriously suggesting that men the world over were hiding a secret: "Ladies, many of you do not realise how often men think about the Roman Empire."
Ms. Vincent asked her husband, Remy, how often the ancient civilization crossed his mind, and shared his response in a post that has now been viewed millions of times: "Without missing a beat he said 'Every day."'
When asked in an interview what "every day" entailed, in practical effect, Mr. Vincent, 33, said, "I'll be going through my day and my internal monologue, as I'm driving on the highway, will remind me that this was something the Romans in a way created." He continued, "I then start to wonder what daily life was like back then."
Delara Alviri, 28, an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles, found greater ambivalence when she surveyed 10 of her male friends about Rome this week. Five of them were really into it, but the other five were relatively unmoved. One said he thought about ancient Rome only when he ordered pizza from the chain Little Caesars.
Ms. Alviri said the trope reminded her of "girl dinner," another online phenomenon that declared something not obviously gendered -- in that case, a plate of nibbles -- to be a uniquely gendered experience. "I feel like it has to do with a lot of the current questioning of gender roles and norms in general," she said.
Judith Hallett, an emeritus professor of classics at the University of Maryland, described ancient Rome as "a place where there were many different definitions of masculinity."
But after first being exposed to the civilization in middle and secondary school, Dr. Hallett added, many men continue to consume Roman history through mass media.
In recent popular culture, Roman history has been told through entertainment media like "Gladiator," winner of the 2000 Oscar for best picture, and the TV show "Spartacus," which focus on battles and often appeal to male audiences. "The games you play and what TV shows you watch are informing a new audience of Roman fans," she said.
Others have argued that ancient Rome is intriguing to Americans because the country is facing a similar decline today.
That kind of status anxiety is not unique to the United States, or even to the 21st century, Dr. Feeney of N.Y.U. said. Indeed, The New York Times published articles comparing the state of the United States to the decline of Rome in 1975, 1999, 2007, 2018, 2021 and just this month.
Still, it's not as if ancient Rome is all that men talk about, Mr. Vincent said.
"We're not necessarily cracking open beers talking about the Roman Empire," he said. "But it does kind of come up when we talk about who would win in a fight -- a gladiatorial fight -- between Thanos and Captain America."

Smoke This: [TStyle]

Full text: A symbol of dirty habits and corporate greed -- and an enduring icon of old-school glamour -- smoking is making an unlikely comeback in sculpture, design and even food.
This past spring, Andrew Gori, 40, and Ambre Kelly, 44, the founders of the Spring/Break Art Show -- a fair for emerging and midcareer artists -- decided to pull together a last-minute, salon-style pop-up in New York's NoLIta based on what their "alums had available in their studios right at that moment," Gori says. As the submissions rolled in, one trend stood out: "There were so many cigarettes!" So many, in fact, that when their "Secret Show" opened in May, one room was dedicated entirely to cigarette-inspired art: There were nearly three-foot-high versions that resembled shaggy plush toys, made by Thomas Martinez-Pilnik, 29. There were sculptures in a variety of stubbed-out shapes constructed from steel by Mary Gagler, and clay by Emily Marchand. And on a 4-by-5-foot square of AstroTurf, 17 true-to-scale ceramic butts by Taylor Lee Nicholson, 32, were scattered like the contents of an overturned ashtray. "For these artists, cigarettes seem to represent childhood memories of their parents or grandparents smoking, but also a lost human connection," Gori says. "I think there's a yearning to return to an analog socialness and a time that cigarettes represent."
Whether it's nostalgia, a backlash to wellness culture or a manifestation of existential anxiety, the cigarette is suddenly a pervasive presence in art, design and even food. The collector and curator Beth Rudin DeWoody, 71, says that young artists "are returning to old images of cigarettes in ads and films from the '60s and '70s that are so glamorous and striking -- if you took away the actual poison of the cigarette." In December, she curated a cigarette-themed show at her private art space, the Bunker, in West Palm Beach, Fla., including pieces from contemporary artists such as the painters Ana Benaroya and Danielle McKinney, as well as seminal works like Claes Oldenburg's drawing "Design for a Bowling Alley in the Form of Cigarette and Smoke" (1968).
"The cigarette has become a visual object more than anything else," says Todd Heim, known on Instagram as his drag alter ego, Steak Diane. "It's the party prop du jour." For Christmas, his friend Lydia Cambron, the 40-year-old senior store designer for the furniture company MillerKnoll in New York, made cookies that resembled ashtrays filled with cigarettes. Her photos of the treats -- constructed from gingerbread, pretzel sticks dipped in white chocolate and ash gray sanding sugar -- went viral, inspiring many imitators, including Heim, who recreated the cookies for another party. "We put them next to a bowl of real cigarettes," says the 34-year-old, whose recently launched tabletop line, Chez Diane, includes coasters embroidered with cigarettes that were inspired by his childhood in Iowa, where his parents and grandparents smoked at the dinner table. "Yes, they're bad for your health, but I think we've all realized vaping is probably worse for you than the real thing," he says. "And we're living through a moment when there are a lot of bad things for our health that are beyond our control."
That's an attitude that Daniel E. Soares, 29, the owner of the New York catering company Alimentari Flaneur, is also embracing with the grazing tables he creates for clients like Goop. Alongside cheese and charcuterie, he almost always includes a platter of figs interspersed with dozens of loose Marlboro Golds. "Most of the time, people laugh and eat around them," he says. "But cigarettes don't have to be smoked to send a message that it's OK to indulge." The British ceramic artist Alma Berrow, 31, who makes renderings of overflowing ashtrays, as well as sticks of butter with butts stubbed out in them, is drawn to the subversive quality of cigarettes. "Stuck in the middle of food, they can have a tinge of anarchy," she says. "But I make my cigarettes really glossy with a bit of gold trim, so they also look like candy -- and have none of that real-life stink."
Nicholson, whose ceramic butts were also sold at the "Secret Show" for $ 35 each, is less interested in celebrating the aesthetic appeal of cigarettes than in exploring the evils of the industry behind them. The Charlotte, N.C.-based artist grew up among the tobacco farms of Williamston, where their grandmother worked in the fields. "As she got older, her skin became littered with cancer because of all those years out in the sun," Nicholson says. "Seeing my grandmother die and not being compensated in any way showed me how disposable people are to Big Tobacco. And since the cigarette is also a disposable item, I thought it would be interesting to discard my art, too." So this past spring, they took a road trip along Route 66, pulling over at gas stations and truck stops to leave ceramic cigarettes on toilet seats, sinks and stacks of newspapers. "I think my generation can relate more to addiction to the phone than addiction to tobacco," they say. "But this idea of disposability is still around. To me, cigarettes represent how we treat both things and people now."

Full text: You've Got (Scam) Mail
A few months ago, I received an email that, at first glance, looked like dozens of others that arrived in my inbox this year. I'm a professional illustrator, and this person was writing with what appeared to be a job offer.
Some things felt slightly off, but I wrote back.
The response was surprising: The person knew some things about hiring an illustrator, using industry terminology and making other requests typical of art directors.
We exchanged several more emails. I asked some questions and negotiated a higher rate. At this point, I was almost certain it was a scam.
And then the most glaring red flag: The person wanted to pay me immediately. As a freelancer, I almost always collect payment once a project is completed. Sometimes it takes months.
Out of curiosity, I decided to play along and agreed to take the job.
Scams have been around forever, but in 2022, consumers reported losing almost $ 8.8 billion to fraud, a 30 percent jump from the year before, according to data released by the Federal Trade Commission.
The actual number is probably much higher. John Breyault, a fraud expert at the National Consumers League, said that fraud tended to be underreported.
The pandemic also created a perfect storm for scams.
My experience made me think that other people were being scammed too, but just didn't talk about it.
So I decided to find out firsthand: I put out a call on Instagram and was almost instantly flooded with peoples' stories of being swindled through LinkedIn when applying for a job, on eBay when buying things, on Craigslist when looking for an apartment. Often, the targets were in vulnerable positions: desperate for work or housing, or experiencing momentous life changes.
Talking to others about their experiences sent me down an internet rabbit hole about scammers, and I discovered an entire subculture devoted to baiting them.
I began obsessively watching YouTube videos of people trying to "scam the scammers," like the account of a software engineer from Northern Ireland who uses the pseudonym Jim Browning to protect his privacy. On his channel, which has over four million subscribers, he creates content to educate people about common tactics of scammers and how to catch them in the act.
"I go to extremes," he said about the tactics he uses to turn the tables on con artists. "If they're using computers, do they have a webcam or CCTV? Can I see the guy that's trying to scam me? I've changed the robocall messages that they've sent out. I've made videos where I've sent harmless devices into scam call centers. I teamed up with Mark Rober -- an ex-NASA engineer -- and we managed to send things that released cockroaches and mice. That was an attempt to poke a bit of fun at the scammers."
The mechanics of scamming are as old as time, but technology has made it more sophisticated. "There will always be scammers, there always have been," the software engineer from Northern Ireland said. "The only thing that's changed is the technology that they use."
Mr. Breyault, the fraud expert, agreed.
He also said that generative A.I. could be used by scammers to make their ruses more sophisticated.
Eventually I let my scammer know that I knew what was really going on. What I got back was a confession:
Was this person really in dire straits? I'll never know. But at that point the only thing to do was walk away.

A Generational Shift at the Laver Cup: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Young players are stepping up as some older ones fade. Even Roger Federer, the event's father, has retired.
Coming into this year's U.S. Open, Ben Shelton felt that he had something to prove. But it didn't have anything to do with the final major championship of the year, where he reached the semifinals before falling to the eventual winner, Novak Djokovic.
Instead, Shelton thought he had to justify his inclusion on the six-man Team World in the Laver Cup, an elite competition that begins Friday at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia.
"When the announcement first came out, I saw all these comments on Instagram, like, 'Why did you take him? Why? Why this guy? There's so many higher-ranked players,"' said Shelton, who entered the U.S. Open at No. 47 in the world but is now No. 19 because of his semifinal finish in New York. "I wanted to show people that maybe I deserved to be on the team."
The Laver Cup began in Prague in 2017 and trades continents each year between Europe and North America. Team Europe, captained by Bjorn Borg, who won 11 majors, features Andrey Rublev, Casper Ruud, Hubert Hurkacz, Gaël Monfils, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Arthur Fils. John McEnroe, who won seven major singles titles, is captain of Team World. His players are Shelton, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe, Tommy Paul, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Francisco Cerundolo.
Last year's event in London was noteworthy because it featured Roger Federer's final match before retirement. His greatest rivals, Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, all showed up to honor him. His last match, a doubles loss with his teammate Nadal to Tiafoe and Jack Sock, was a tearful tribute to the 20-time major champion.
This year's Laver Cup represents a generational shift in the sport. Federer has retired, and Nadal, 37, has not played an ATP match since the Australian Open in January because of injuries.
Murray, at age 36, is not the player he was when he captured the U.S. Open in 2012, Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016, and became world No. 1 in 2016. And Djokovic, who won his 24th major at the U.S. Open less than two weeks ago and is the current No. 1, is focusing on winning another major.
"The end of an era heralds the beginning of a new one," said Rod Laver -- the player for whom the competition is named -- who was part of his own generation's rivalries with Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe, Arthur Ashe and Jan Kodes, among others. "Today's leading younger players are jockeying for pole position, and we'll get to see them competing in a team setting in Vancouver, which weaves the eras together."
McEnroe, who had his own spirited rivalries with Borg, Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl throughout the 1970s and '80s, lamented that the Laver Cup had not generated the same appeal among the players as the Ryder Cup, the team event in golf.
"The goal was to make it like golf's Ryder Cup, where everyone was waiting until the last minute to see who was hottest, but everyone was available," McEnroe said. "It doesn't seem to be the case now. It's tougher to get everyone committed."
Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning Wimbledon champ and world No. 2, has declined to play, as has the U.S. Open runner-up and the world No. 3, Daniil Medvedev. But six of the next 11 ranked players are competing this year, and three others, Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, have played in the past.
This year, Team Europe will play without its powerful core of Federer, Nadal, Murray, Djokovic, Alcaraz and Medvedev. Winners in each of the first four years, the Europeans lost on the last day last year when Team World's Auger-Aliassime beat Djokovic and Tiafoe outlasted Tsitsipas.
Paul, who beat Alcaraz in a tournament in Canada this summer but then lost to Shelton at the U.S. Open, said he was keenly aware of the void left by the Big Four.
"It's definitely a big loss for tennis in general, not just Laver Cup," he said. "It obviously gives us a pretty good opportunity."
Fritz, who last year won his only Laver Cup singles match, acknowledged the generational shift.
"I think times are definitely changing," said Fritz, who is the top-ranked American at No. 8. "It's going to be a really different Laver Cup this year with how Team Europe is made up."
Tiafoe, who lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Shelton, agreed.
"Yeah, it's generational," Tiafoe said during the Open. "I think the fans are going to appreciate the new faces. Tennis is at a great place; the level is getting better and better."
Before he first played in 2021, Rublev was skeptical of the event, which awards no ATP ranking points.
"When I was watching on TV, I was thinking, the way they are so excited, it's not real," he said. "But when you get there, you want to win. You get with the team, you start to feel the support, and you don't want to let them down."
Fritz is also aware of the camaraderie of the team competition that is so rare in tennis. Last year, members of Team Europe watched a doubles practice session between Federer and Nadal and Murray and Djokovic. Both teams sat intently on the sidelines during each match, cheering and giving coaching advice.
In tennis, when you win, Fritz said during the U.S. Open, "you don't really have people to celebrate with and have fun with. Winning last year, I felt like that was one of the top moments of my tennis career because we were able to celebrate with a group of my close friends."
Seismic movements in tennis are nothing new. After Laver and his rivals, and Borg-McEnroe-Connors-Lendl, came Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Michael Chang. Each time an era ends, there are those who feel that there can never be one as great.
Then came Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray. And now Alcaraz has emerged to challenge Djokovic, as have other talented young players.
Shelton, who turns 21 next month, is one of them. A former player at the University of Florida, he helped the Gators to the 2021 N.C.A.A. team championship. He then won the N.C.A.A. singles title the next year before leaving school and turning pro last year.
At the Open this year, Shelton became the youngest American man to reach the semifinals since Chang did in 1992. For Shelton, the Laver Cup has a special attraction.
"I'm pretty pumped to be in the team atmosphere," he said at the U.S. Open. "First team competition I've been part of since I left college. I'm going to be just as amped and emotional in Vancouver as I was here."

Taking a Look at the Singles Events Horizon: [Style Desk]

Full text: At a speed-dating event in August, $ 25 bought attendees 20 dates with strangers, each roughly five minutes long.
When the first blind dates began, it wasn't long before some people -- mostly men -- tried to go out of order so they could talk to the person they were most attracted to.
"There's a seat right here," one of the event's organizers said, steering a wayward attendee back into the designated flow.
Speed dating is no easy feat, requiring the conversational stamina of a filibuster champion, the brevity of an auctioneer and a positive mood to fight the boredom of repetition. Drinks were encouraged.
"I'm a very personable person -- I hate texting, I love phone calls," said N'dack Fleming, 28, who added that she was ready to leave behind her "hookup phase." "So I was like, OK, this experience is a very personable experience."
The event, called We Met IRL, was created by Maxine Williams as a balm for those who have found it difficult to navigate a sometimes unsavory dating scene in New York City, where endless swiping and lukewarm flings can convince even the most introverted that it's time to leave the apartment. This summer, We Met IRL was just one of several events that nudged singles out into the real world, uniting them through common interests or kitschy themes, sometimes the more contrived, the better.
Singles events have long asked people to place their hopes for romance in the hands of strangers, promising attendees -- if nothing else -- the chance to get out of their comfort zones. Many of these events held in New York this summer centered on activities, like ax throwing, or shared interests, like a love of reading.
At a singles party for queer people of color hosted by the queer collective Raw Honey at the Sultan Room in Brooklyn last month, more than 200 attendees showed up to kick off cuffing season. Each person was asked to pick a colored wrist band: Red signaled you were there only to make friends, yellow identified you as polyamorous, and green meant you were single and down to mingle.
Gabrielle Hitchens, the founder of the collective, said that she knew it could be hard for queer people of color "to find each other and connect," so she wanted to provide a destination for them to do so in a party setting. Between dancing and drinking, many in the room seemed to hit it off, with at least one pair confirming they had a date planned in the days ahead.
Cambria Evans moved to New York City in 2021, and she said she hadn't yet been able to fully explore the queer community as a bisexual woman in Brooklyn. When she saw a flier for the Raw Honey event on Instagram, she thought it would be a great way to get out of her comfort zone.
"I did see a bunch of people that I was definitely attracted to, but I was definitely too shy to talk to them," Ms. Evans recalled a few days after the party, which she attended alone. "I am doing things one thing at a time."
A brightly lit room in Williamsburg filled with dog treats, toys and kibble might not be the most obvious setting for flirting and romance. However, dozens of people gathered last week at Boris & Horton, a dog-friendly cafe in Brooklyn, to do just that.
It was a "Must Love Dogs" singles mixer hosted by the Blink Date, a dating app founded by Taly Matiteyahu that schedules 10-minute phone dates for its members with potential matches. A lot of mingling happened among the dozens of guests, but at first, it was mostly the dogs introducing themselves.
Vladimir Manosalvas, who referred to himself as "single like a Pringle," said he came to the event alone with the intention of meeting dogs and only dogs: "Dogs are love, dogs are life and even though I like people, I mostly came to this mix-and-match event for the dogs."
Allie Shoemaker, who was at the cafe with her two dogs, Itty Bitty and Doodle, came to the event to look for a potential match but didn't have high expectations. She quoted a Carrie Underwood song that summed up her dating experience: "The more boys I meet, the more I love my dogs."
"The peace I feel right now, that I always wanted to feel with a partner, I feel with them, and that's OK," she said.
It's safe to say that many of us still yearn for a classic meet-cute that online dating cannot achieve. Singles mixers dangle the idea that you might find the one (or at least the person you want to cuff through the fall and winter) over drink specials and a niche theme. The only thing you need is an event link to place you and your future partner in the right place at the right time.

Full text: The suit, filed with the Authors Guild, accuses the A.I. company of infringing on authors' copyrights, claiming it used their books to train its ChatGPT chatbot.
A group of prominent novelists, including John Grisham, Jonathan Franzen and Elin Hilderbrand, are joining the legal battle against OpenAI over its chatbot technology, as fears about the encroachment of artificial intelligence on creative industries continue to grow.
More than a dozen authors filed a lawsuit against OpenAI on Tuesday, accusing the company, which has been backed with billions of dollars in investment from Microsoft, of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train its popular ChatGPT chatbot. The complaint, which was filed along with the Authors Guild, said that OpenAI's chatbots can now produce "derivative works" that can mimic and summarize the authors' books, potentially harming the market for authors' work, and that the writers were neither compensated nor notified by the company.
"The success and profitability of OpenAI are predicated on mass copyright infringement without a word of permission from or a nickel of compensation to copyright owners," the complaint said.
The complaint, which was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, said that while OpenAI does not publicly declare which works it uses to train its models, the company has admitted to using copyrighted material. The complaint also said that OpenAI's ChatGPT is capable of producing summaries of books that include details not available in reviews or elsewhere online, which suggests the underlying program was fed the books in their entirety.
The Authors Guild lawsuit is the latest in a series brought by writers against OpenAI. It is likely to generate attention because of its high-profile plaintiffs, who include best-selling novelists from a range of genres, among them David Baldacci, Jodi Picoult, George R.R. Martin, George Saunders and Michael Connelly.
Douglas Preston, a novelist who joined the lawsuit, said he was shocked when he asked ChatGPT to describe minor characters in his books and it spat back detailed information that wasn't available in reviews or Wikipedia entries for the novels.
"That's when I looked at this and said, 'My God, ChatGPT has read my books, how many of my books has it read?"' he said. "It knew everything, and that's when I got a bad feeling."
A representative for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November, authors, publishers and retailers have been trying to rein in the rampant and increasingly disruptive incursion of A.I. in the industry. Already, there has been a rise in A.I.-generated books on Amazon, including travel guides and books on plant and fungi foraging, which prompted the New York Mycological Society to issue a warning to avoid A.I.-generated guides.
Amazon has taken steps to monitor and curb the influx of A.I.-generated books. This month, it posted new guidelines for self-published authors, requiring them to disclose whether they had used A.I. to create texts. It also limited the number of titles users can upload to its self-publishing platform each day, to three. Amazon does not currently disclose which books are created by A.I. to its customers, but it may do so in the future, according to an Amazon representative.
A handful of other lawsuits have been filed in recent months by writers against OpenAI and Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram. This month, Michael Chabon, Ayelet Waldman and Matthew Klam were among a group of writers who collectively sued OpenAI and Meta, which has also developed A.I. technology, for copyright infringement.
In a filing last month for another suit brought by authors, lawyers for OpenAI moved to dismiss the bulk of plaintiffs' claims, and argued that using texts "for innovations," including training A.I., constitutes fair use.
Copyright questions surrounding A.I. remain unresolved, and experts are divided over whether authors' claims of infringement will hold up in court. Some argue that if an A.I. program is ingesting copyrighted works for training but creates new works that are substantially different, that constitutes fair use. Others, however, believe the authors' argument is likely to prevail.
"They've scraped all this content and put it into their databases without asking permission -- that seems like a huge grab of content," said Edward Klaris, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property and media law. "I think courts are going to say that copying into the database is an infringement in itself."
Mary Bly, who publishes historical romance novels under the name Eloisa James, said she joined the Authors Guild suit because she worried that if writers failed to draw boundaries around their work, technology companies would continue to plunder and imitate them.
"This lawsuit is important because it establishes a line in the sand," she said. "If you're going to train things in the future on my books, you need to license them. You can't just take things."

Irish Grinstead, 43, of R&B Girl Group 702: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The song, from 1999, was the biggest hit for her, her sister and a friend, who made up the R&B trio 702.
Irish Grinstead, a member of the R&B trio 702, best known for their 1999 hit, "Where My Girls At?," died on Saturday. She was 43.
Her sister and bandmate LeMisha Fields announced the death in an Instagram post. It provided no other details. The group announced in December that Ms. Grinstead was taking a "medical leave of absence due to serious medical issues."
The Grinstead sisters and Kameelah Williams made up 702, which was named for the telephone area code in Las Vegas, where they were from.
The group's 1996 debut album, "No Doubt," included a song called "Steelo," featuring the rapper, singer and producer Missy Elliott. A version of the track was the theme song for the Nickelodeon show "Cousin Skeeter." (The song was also sampled in a 2019 dance music hit, "On My Mind," produced by Diplo.)
"Where My Girls At?" was 702's defining hit, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1999. It appeared on their second album, "702," and it was written and produced by Missy Elliott, who "was a big player in our success," Ms. Fields told The Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2014. Ms. Grinstead was 18 when it was released.
The song, a thumping, danceable number with sweet harmonizing by the trio, carries lyrics warning off a female romantic rival. But the song's refrain -- its title -- sounds as much like a young woman's expression of need for her friends.

"Although the group is not often remembered as much as some of their '90s counterparts" -- among them Destiny's Child and TLC -- "the singing trio had a huge influence on the culture of R&B music," Vibe magazine wrote in 2018.
Irish Beatrice Grinstead was born on June 2, 1980, in Harris, Texas, to Carlton and Theresa (Washington) Grinstead.
She began singing around the age of 10. With LeMisha and Irish's twin sister, Orish, they performed at sports events and other venues in Las Vegas, where the sisters had grown up. They occasionally sang at Caesars Palace, the hotel and casino. The comedian Sinbad saw them there and encouraged them to go to Atlanta for a music convention.
During that event they cornered the musician and producer Michael Bivins in a hotel lobby and persuaded him to give them a chance. He did, supplied them with their band name as well and signed them to a record contract. All three were still in their teens.
But before the trio recorded their first album, Orish dropped out, making room for Ms. Williams, a friend of the Grinstead girls since the 6th grade.
"People are asking me for my autograph," Irish told The Review-Journal in wonderment in 1999, "and we were just talking to each other at school."
The group released its last album, "Star," in 2003 and broke up soon after. They resumed doing shows more recently, with several scheduled through the rest of this year.
Complete information on Ms. Grinstead's survivors was not available. Orish Grinstead died in 2008, according to IMDb.
"It was a whirlwind," their sister Ms. Fields told The Review-Journal in 2014, looking back at her group's stardom. "We toured all over the world and met artists like Whitney Houston and Diana Ross. The life that we lived was almost like a dream."

Savor the Tastes of Summer Near the Seashore: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The water's warm and these spots are still open for burgers, clams and locally caught seafood.
Hi, it's Pete Wells, restaurant critic of The Times and hopeless summer person. I love summer and everything that comes with it -- heat waves, shark sightings, weird smells, you name it.
Last week, panic set in as I realized September is well underway and I haven't swam, fished, grilled or listened to "Padam Padam" anywhere near as often as I meant to.
But there's still time. Our beaches are beautiful this month, with acres of wide-open sand to lie on. The water is as warm as it gets, drawing pods of dolphins to spout and breach just offshore. And some of my favorite spots on or near local beaches won't close for a few more weeks. Others stay open all year long.
Spectro , Jacob Riis Park, Queens
There are two burger stands on the boardwalk at what's called the People's Beach, and each has its charms. Space Burgers, in Bay 9, the brick building at the west end of the park, flattens its grass-fed patties on a griddle, smashburger-style, giving them a dark and crunchy sear. It's a fine day-at-the-beach burger, and you can get it with a lemonade slushie. Still, when I pull into the enormous parking lot at Riis, my car usually noses toward a spot at the other end of the beach. Spectro's white prefab container is the only concession around, rising from the sand with the bold geometric confidence of an Ed Ruscha gas station.
The beef patties are a little taller and juicier than the ones at Space Burgers. The pickles are outstanding. The fries, slender and golden, are sprinkled with pepper and salt. There is watermelon juice, fresh honey-ginger lemonade -- "with electrolytes!" the chalkboard menu promises -- and many flavors of Ocean Bomb, a sugary Taiwanese soda in cans decorated with portraits of Sailor Moon and her fellow Sailor Guardians. (Friday to Sunday, weather permitting, at least until Oct. 1.)
Whit's End , Rockaway Beach, Queens
Every bohemian beach town from Provincetown to Tulum needs a bohemian restaurant. In Rockaway Beach, that restaurant is Whit's End. It has the cavernous, shadowy look of a roadhouse out on a country road, though it doesn't have any beer lights. (Or any beer, for that matter.) Two oil paintings hang on the walls. Both are portraits of striped bass. This gives you a fair idea what you are in for.
Whitney Aycock, the chef and owner, leans heavily on seafood caught nearby. He cooks in broad strokes, with no regard at all for what's stylish over in Manhattan. Slabs of local bluefin might be wrapped in crisp sushi rice and crisscrossed with spicy mayo. A super-smooth smoked bluefish dip, made with rivers of olive oil but no mayonnaise, comes with a Jenga stack of freshly baked crackers. The pot of clams is something to be reckoned with: chewy cherrystones and fried sticks of bread that you can soak in the pint or so of briny tomato sauce.
There is pizza, too, from two wood-burning ovens. Just don't ask for a slice -- one of about two dozen rules and best practices on a page of the menu called "The Ways of Whit." It's enthusiastically profane; "We like dogs" is one of the few items that can be printed in its entirety in The Times. (Year round.)
Butler's Flat Clam Shack , Port Washington, N.Y.
I won't try to tell you that the beaches near the North Shore town of Port Washington, N.Y., are more beautiful than Cape Cod's. They are not. I will tell you, though, that Port Washington has a clam shack that may be the equal of such revered Cape seafood palaces as Cobies, Moby Dick's and the Kream 'N Kone.
Butler's Flat looks the part. It's an unpainted shed on a Manhasset Bay pier where you order at the window, then look for a table next to the docks as sea gulls whine for scraps.The fried clams are fat and custardy under a crust that is less a helmet than a veil. If whole-belly clams, with their faintly bitter taste of organs, aren't for you, the fried scallops, oysters and flounder are also archetypal. So is the lobster roll, an item that's become more common in New York City than pastrami.
A more unusual treat is the stuffed quahog. Butler's Flat bakes its stuffies in the Portuguese manner of New Bedford, Mass., flavoring the chopped clams and bread crumbs with garlic-scented bits of linguiça. The shack's season ends in October, but about 20 miles south in Rockville Centre, Bigelow's stays open all year, slinging seafood platters and chowder at its wraparound linoleum counter. A few yards away, eight lanes of traffic zoom along the Sunrise Highway, but Bigelow's clams can make you hear the pounding surf. (Wednesday to Sunday, until Oct. 29.) What I'm reading ...
Momofuku Ssam Bar's impending closure was announced just two days after Fast Company published Joshua David Stein's article about Marguerite Zabar Mariscal, Momofuku's chief executive -- who did not mention Ssam Bar. I wonder if Ms. Mariscal still maintains that her company's restaurants "will always be the most experiential and complete way to experience Momofuku" now that she's turning out the lights on the restaurant that used to served as a manifesto for the Momofuku lifestyle?
Do shoppers who buy Momofuku Chili Crunch in their local Whole Foods care that the condiment is connected to actual places where you can sit down and have dinner? After all, the company that owns Rao's pasta sauce recently sold for $ 2.7 billion to Campbell Soup, even though the percentage of supermarket customers who've been to the original Rao's must be a very small number.

Internet Law in U.K. Shields Children and Targets Illicit Content: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The far-reaching bill had set off debates about balancing free speech and privacy rights against efforts to halt the spread of harmful content online.
Britain passed a sweeping law on Tuesday to regulate online content, introducing age-verification requirements for pornography sites and other rules to reduce hate speech, harassment and other illicit material.
The Online Safety Bill, which also applies to terrorist propaganda, online fraud and child safety, is one of the most far-reaching attempts by a Western democracy to regulate online speech. About 300 pages long, the new rules took more than five years to develop, setting off intense debates about how to balance free expression and privacy against barring harmful content, particularly targeted at children.
At one point, messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal threatened to abandon the British market altogether until provisions in the bill that were seen as weakening encryption standards were changed.
The British law goes further than efforts elsewhere to regulate online content, forcing companies to proactively screen for objectionable material and to judge whether it is illegal, rather than requiring them to act only after being alerted to illicit content, according to Graham Smith, a London lawyer focused on internet law.
It is part of a wave of rules in Europe aimed at ending an era of self-regulation in which tech companies set their own policies about what content could stay up or be taken down. The Digital Services Act, a European Union law, recently began taking effect and requires companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit material.
"The Online Safety Bill is a game-changing piece of legislation," Michelle Donelan, the British secretary of technology, said in a statement. "This government is taking an enormous step forward in our mission to make the U.K. the safest place in the world to be online."
British political figures have been under pressure to pass the new policy as concerns grew about the mental health effects of internet and social media use among young people. Families that attributed their children's suicides to social media were among the most aggressive champions of the bill.
Under the new law, content aimed at children that promotes suicide, self-harm and eating disorders must be restricted. Pornography companies, social media platforms and other services will be required to introduce age-verification measures to prevent children from gaining access to pornography, a shift that some groups have said will harm the availability of information online and undercut privacy. The Wikimedia Foundation, the operator of Wikipedia, has said it will be unable to comply with the law and may be blocked as a result.
TikTok, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram will also be required to introduce features that allow users to choose to encounter lower amounts of harmful content, such as eating disorders, self-harm, racism, misogyny or antisemitism.
"At its heart, the bill contains a simple idea: that providers should consider the foreseeable risks to which their services give rise and seek to mitigate -- like many other industries already do," said Lorna Woods, a professor of internet law at the University of Essex, who helped draft the law.
The bill has drawn criticism from tech firms, free speech activists and privacy groups who say it threatens freedom of expression because it will incentivize companies to take down content.
Questions remain about how the law will be enforced. That responsibility falls to Ofcom, the British regulator in charge of overseeing broadcast television and telecommunications, which now must outline rules for how it will police online safety.
Companies that do not comply can face fines of up of 18 million pounds, or about $ 22.3 million, or up to 10 percent of global revenue, whichever is the higher amount. Company executives could face criminal action for not providing information during Ofcom investigations, or if they do not comply with rules related to child safety and child sexual exploitation.

Debris From Missing Fighter Jet Is Found: [National Desk]

Full text: Debris was found north of Charleston, S.C., one day after a pilot on a training mission ejected and the military lost track of his jet.
The United States military said on Monday evening that searchers had found the wreckage of an F-35 jet in South Carolina, one day after the Marine Corps inexplicably lost track of it when the pilot ejected with a parachute.
Joint Base Charleston said in a statement that searchers who had been looking for the missing warplane located debris in Williamsburg County, north of Charleston. A spokesman for the U.S. Marine Corps later confirmed that it was from the jet.
"Members of the community should avoid the area as the recovery team secures the debris field," the statement said, adding that Joint Base Charleston was handing command of the incident to the Marine Corps "as they begin the recovery process."
The discovery came after an array of government and civilian agencies had spent more than 24 hours searching for the missing F-35. Joint Base Charleston had even made an unusual plea for help, releasing a phone number for members of the public to call with information about the lost plane.
Before the debris was found, the search had prompted widespread speculation. Was the jet still somehow airborne, perhaps flying on autopilot? Had it crashed undetected into a lake or the ocean? Did the Pentagon really have no method for tracing it?
"How in the hell do you lose an F-35?" Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican and the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, had asked her social media followers. "We're asking the public to what, find a jet and turn it in?"
The mystery began when a Marine pilot used an emergency parachute to eject from the F-35B Lightning II on Sunday afternoon over North Charleston, S.C. He was taken to a local medical center and was in stable condition there, Jeremy Huggins, a spokesman for Joint Base Charleston, said Sunday.
It was unclear why the pilot needed to bail out. A second F-35 pilot who had also been on the training mission landed without any problems, Tech. Sgt. James Cason, another base spokesman, said.
Based on the missing plane's last known position, the base had been focusing on an area around Lake Moultrie, a large lake about 33 miles north of Charleston, and Lake Marion, the state's largest lake, in coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration, Joint Base Charleston said.
Williamsburg County, where the debris was found, is not far from those lakes.
It was not immediately clear if anyone in the vicinity had reported seeing or hearing a crash.
The search involved the Marines, its Second Marine Aircraft Wing, Navy regional authorities in the Southeast, the Civil Air Patrol and the Federal Aviation Administration. Law enforcement teams across the state were also helping.
The disappearance of the jet had prompted jokes and memes on social media.
On Threads, the Instagram platform, the actor Misha Collins wrote under a picture of the jet: "That's what they get for leaving the keys in the ignition. In other news, check out my new listing on Craigslist. No lowball offers!"
"What's the problem?" Tim Robinson, the editor in chief of Aerospace, the magazine of the Royal Aeronautical Society, asked on X (formerly Twitter). He posted a photo of an F-35 on a golf course. "I just sneaked off for a quick round of golf."
More seriously, the incident prompted broader safety concerns.
The Marines released a statement on Monday saying that Gen. Eric M. Smith, the acting commander of the Marines, had directed all Marine Corps aviation units to conduct a two-day "pause in operations" this week to discuss aviation safety matters and best practices.
The statement said the directive came after three "Class-A aviation mishaps" over the last six weeks. Such mishaps involve property damage of $ 2.5 million or more, according to a Marine Corps document.
During the "safety stand down," aviation commanders will lead discussions with Marines focusing on the fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedure and maintaining combat readiness, the statement said.
The F-35 is one of three types of small jets that have been made for the U.S. military.
The F-35B, which can both take off and land vertically as well as hover in place, is only operated by the Marine Corps, which can fly them from aircraft carriers and smaller amphibious assault ships alike.
The jet is designed to carry weapons like air-to-air missiles and guided bombs in internal bays, which reduces the warplane's radar signature, making it harder for potential enemies to find. That stealthiness may also be partially responsible for why the Pentagon appears to have lost contact with the plane.
Manufactured by Lockheed Martin, the F-35B Lightning II completed its first combat strikes for the Marine Corps in Afghanistan in 2018.
The F-35's Joint Strike Fighter program is the Department of Defense's most expensive weapon system program, with estimates that it will cost nearly $ 1.7 trillion to buy, operate, and sustain the aircraft and systems over their lifetime, the Government Accountability Office said in a report released in May
The cost of the Marine Corps jet has varied over the life of the program. The federal government said it was as low as $ 70 million in 2012, and the Project on Government Oversight said it was as high as $ 135 million in 2020.

Full text: Some memory lapses are a normal part of brain function, experts say.
I was in the supermarket recently when a woman came running toward me. "Jancee!" she said. "How are you?"
I smiled. She looked familiar, but what was her name? As she chatted, I silently recited the alphabet, hoping it would jog my memory. Please don't let her name be Zoe, I thought; I can't fake this for much longer.
It's natural to wonder whether our memory is getting worse as we age -- and those concerns aren't unreasonable: Some 5.8 million Americans live with dementia, which is marked by a significant loss of cognitive functions. And the biggest risk factor for dementia is aging.
But some age-related memory lapses aren't cause for concern. I spoke with four experts about the ways memory shifts, how we can remember a bit more, and when to discuss forgetfulness with a doctor.
Temporarily blanking on names and misplacing items is normal.
I asked Dr. Mario Mendez, director of behavioral neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at U.C.L.A., about age-related memory problems, but he corrected my choice of words: "I'd say 'memory changes,"' he said. "And that does not translate necessarily into a problem."
In a study of nearly 50,000 people, researchers found that short term memory peaks around age 25. But starting in your fifties, Dr. Mendez said, the area of the brain in charge of memory retrieval is less efficient. Still, "being less efficient is different from impairment," he said. So if you're struggling to remember "that movie starring that guy," the memory is often there, Dr. Mendez said -- it just takes longer to surface. "And then lo and behold, five minutes later, you remember," he said.
Forgetting your car keys or someone's name is often seen as a brain malfunction, but it's not, said Dr. Ronald Davis, professor of neuroscience at the Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology. We are inundated with so much information each day, said Dr. Davis, and the brain has to manage memories. "Forgetting is a normal part of one's brain function," he said.
There are ways to keep your memory relatively sharp.
Just because memory changes are normal, it doesn't mean that you can't try to improve your memory, said Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh, an assistant professor of neurology and psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. Instead of using recall-enhancing tricks (like the one I tried in the supermarket), a few lifestyle changes may help.
First, Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh said, limit multitasking. It's not good for your brain health in general, but as we get older, our capacity to multitask "typically diminishes," he said. "I tell patients, 'try to do one thing at a time."'
Other tried-and-true habits are linked to better cognitive skills later in life, Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh said. Be mindful of stress, which has a direct influence on memory, he said. And several studies link sleep loss to memory deficits, he added, so do your best to get adequate rest. Diet, he said, can also affect memory.
Finally, Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh said, a half-hour of daily cardiovascular exercise can generate new neurons in the hippocampal area of the brain, which is critical for memory consolidation.
Sometimes a doctor's visit is in order.
There are circumstances where you should check in with your doctor, Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh said. If, for example, someone who knows you well points out that your forgetfulness has changed significantly -- perhaps you are asking the same question over and over, or forgetting the names of loved ones -- it might be a sign of something more serious.
Early signs of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association, include losing the ability to retrace steps, problems judging distances, and increasingly needing to rely on memory aids (like reminder notes or phone alerts) for things you were once able to recall on your own.
Ultimately, if you feel like memory loss is disrupting your daily life, make an appointment to be assessed by a doctor, said Scott Small, a professor of neurology at Columbia and author of "Forgetting: The Benefits of Not Remembering." A good clinician, he explained, can explore potential causes for memory problems whether it's a disease or other factors, such as certain painkillers or sleeping aids.
After talking to the brain experts, I felt reassured. And my friend's name, as it turned out, was Erica -- so I only had to fake recognition for a few seconds.
Elaine LaLanne, a fitness pioneer, is almost 100 -- and she works out every day.
For decades, Elaine LaLanne was the guiding force behind Jack LaLanne, her husband, business partner and the father of modern fitness. Since his death, she has cultivated her own ardent following -- and has become a model for aging well.

Tiny Homes Are Popular on TikTok. But in Real Life?: [Correction]

Full text: A series about how cities transform, and the effect of that on everyday life.
In a bustling area of south London, near a busy Underground station and a web of bus routes, is a tiny house in a dumpster.
The 27-square-foot plywood house has a central floor area; wall shelves for storage (or seating); a kitchen counter with a sink, hot plate and toy-size fridge; and a mezzanine with a mattress under the vaulted roof. There's no running water, and the bathroom is a portable toilet outside.
The "skip house" is the creation and home of Harrison Marshall, 29, a British architect and artist who designs community buildings, such as schools and health centers, in Britain and abroad. Since he moved into the rent-free dumpster (known as a "skip" in Britain) in January, social media videos of the space have drawn tens of millions of views and dozens of inquiries in a city where studio apartments rent for at least $ 2,000 a month.
"People are having to move into smaller and smaller places, microapartments, tiny houses, just to try and make ends meet," Mr. Marshall said in a phone interview. "There are obviously benefits of minimal living, but that should be a choice rather than a necessity."
Social media platforms are having a field day with microapartments and tiny homes like Mr. Marshall's, breathing life into the curiosity about that way of living. The small spaces have captivated viewers, whether they are responding to soaring housing prices or to a boundary-pushing alternate lifestyle, as seen on platforms like the Never Too Small YouTube channel. But while there is no precise count on the number of tiny homes and microapartments on the market, the attention on social media has not necessarily made viewers beat a path in droves to move in, perhaps because the spaces sometimes can be a pain to live in.
Mr. Marshall noted that 80 percent of those who contacted him expressing interest in moving into a house like his in the Bermondsey area were not serious about it, and that "most of it is all just buzz and chitchat."
In his view, tiny homes are being romanticized because the life of luxury is overexposed. "People are almost numb to it from social media," he said. Mr. Marshall said people were more interested in content about the "nomadic lifestyle, or living off the grid," which overlooks the flip side: showers at the gym, and a portable outdoor toilet.
The rush back into big cities after the pandemic has pushed rents to new records, intensifying the demand for low-priced housing, including spaces that are barely bigger than a parking spot. But while audiences on social media might find that lifestyle "relatable and entertaining," as one expert put it, it's not necessarily an example they will follow.
Viewers of microapartment videos are like visitors to the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay who "get inside of a cell and have the door closed," said Karen North, a professor of digital social media at the University of Southern California.
Social media users want to experience what it's like at the "anomalously small end" of the housing scale, she explained.
"Our desire to be social with different people -- including influencers and celebrities, or people who are living in a different place in a different way -- can all play out on social media, because it feels like we are making a personal connection," she said.
Pablo J. Boczkowski, a professor of communications studies at Northwestern University, said that despite the belief that new technologies have a powerful influence, millions of clicks don't translate into people making a wholesale lifestyle change.
"From the data that we have so far, there is no basis to say that social media have the ability to change behavior in that way," he said. Although these small spaces aren't a common choice, residents who do take the plunge are driven by real pressures. For people looking to live and work in big cities, the post-pandemic housing situation is dire. In Manhattan in June, the average rental price was $ 5,470, according to a report from the real-estate brokerage Douglas Elliman. Across the city, the average rent this month is $ 3,644, reports Apartments.com, a listing site.
The housing picture is similar in London. In the first three months of this year, the average asking rent in the British capital reached a record of about $ 3,165 a month, as residents who left the city during lockdown swarmed back.
City dwellers in Asia face similar pressures and costs. In Tokyo in March, the average monthly rent hit a record, for the third month in a row. A 750-square-foot apartment in Tokyo rents for roughly $ 1,900 a month.
So when Ryan Crouse, 21, moved to Tokyo in May 2022 from New York, where he was a business student at Marymount Manhattan College, he rented a 172-square-foot microapartment for $ 485 a month. Videos of his Tokyo studio went viral, garnering 20 million to 30 million views across platforms, said Mr. Crouse, who moved into a bigger place this May.
Centrally located, the apartment where he lived for a year had a tiny bathroom: "I could literally put my hands wall to wall," he said. The space also had a mezzanine sleeping area below the roof that was scorchingly hot in the summer, and a sofa so small that he could barely sit on it.
When it comes to microstudios, "a lot of people just like the idea of it, rather than actually doing it," he said. They enjoy "a glimpse into other people's lives."
Mr. Crouse believes the pandemic heightened curiosity. During lockdown, "everyone was on social media, sharing their spaces" and "sharing their lives," and apartment tour videos "went crazy," he said. "That really put a light on tiny spaces like this."
Curiosity on social media seemed to reach a frenzied pitch for Alaina Randazzo, a media planner based in New York, during the year she spent in an 80-square-foot, $ 650-a-month apartment in Midtown Manhattan. It had a sink, but no toilet or shower: Those were down the hall, and shared.
Having spent the previous six months in a luxury high-rise rental that "ate away my money," she said, downsizing was a priority when she moved into the microstudio in January 2022.
Unable to do dishes in her tiny sink, Ms. Randazzo ate off paper plates; there was a skylight but no window to air out cooking smells. "I had to be careful what clothes I was buying," she recalled, "because if I bought too big of a coat, it's like, where am I going to put it?"
Still, videos of her microapartment on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram received tens of millions of views, she said. YouTube influencers, including one with a cooking series, did an on-location shoot in her microstudio, and rappers messaged her asking to do the same.
"The pictures make it look a little bit bigger than it actually is," Ms. Randazzo, 26, said. "There are so many little things that you have to maneuver in those apartments that you don't think about."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There is "a cool factor" around microstudios nowadays, she said, because "you're selling someone on a dream": that they can be successful in New York and "not be judged" for living in a tiny pad. Also, "our generation likes realness," she explained, "someone who's actually showing authenticity" and trying to build a career and a future by saving money.
But it was not the kind of life Ms. Randazzo could keep up for longer than a year. She now shares a large New York townhouse where she has a spacious bedroom. She has no regrets about her microapartment: "I love the community that it brought me but I definitely don't miss bumping my head on the ceiling."

Now Everyone Can See Brooklyn Face to Face: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The Center for Brooklyn History, formerly known as the Brooklyn Historical Society, reopens after a three-year renovation, with free admission and an emphasis on outreach.
Ask a Brooklynite to define New York's most populous borough, and you'll get 2.7 million answers -- or more. At the renovated and rebranded Center for Brooklyn History, they're going with an ellipsis.
"Brooklyn Is ...," a new exhibition, marks the opening of the center, which welcomed visitors on Thursday after a three-year renovation and rethinking of the grand Romanesque revival landmark at 128 Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn Heights, formerly known as the Brooklyn Historical Society.
In addition to the new name, there's now free admission, a more welcoming front entrance, lots of comfortable sofas and an emphasis on drawing a bigger, broader audience, who might not have thought their own stories can be found inside.
"People who are interested in history come from many different places, walks of life, perspectives," Dominique Jean-Louis, the center's chief historian, said during a pre-opening tour. "We hope they will see this as a real place to gather."
The center was born out of a 2020 merger of the historical society and the Brooklyn Public Library, which now owns the building. (The center's annual operating budget is $ 2.4 million, according to the library.) It was the end of an era, but also just the latest rebranding of an institution, and a borough, with a long history of reinvention.
The historical society was founded in 1863 as the Long Island Historical Society, with the mission of preserving the region's rapidly vanishing rural past. It was renamed the Brooklyn Historical Society in 1985, when the brownstone revival was in full swing.
Since then, the global prestige of the "Brooklyn" brand has only grown. The term "historical society," which a number of institutions have dropped over the past decade, is another story.
"One of the first things we decided is that we would change the name, since the word 'society' was off-putting," Linda E. Johnson, the library's chief executive, said. (It remains etched on the facade, which has landmark protection.)
"Everybody's story is here," she added. "It's not just one little slice."
The merger brings together the historical society's deep holdings, which include items dating back as far as the 17th century, with the library's Brooklyn Collection, whose anchors include the vast photo morgue of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, acquired in 1957.
The Brooklyn Collection, with its predominantly 20th-century holdings, had been housed on the second floor of the Art Deco central library on Grand Army Plaza. It lacked a full archival staff and state-of-the-art archival climate control. "That really limited what we could collect," Johnson said.
The combined holdings now include 36,000 books, 325,000 photographs, 2,000 maps, 57,000 artifacts and 1,650 distinct archival collections, whose total number of pages would be as hard to quantify as the sand at Coney Island.
The hope is to periodically send samplings on the road to the library's 62 branches throughout Brooklyn, as outreach. But everything is available in the center's grand upstairs reading room, the Othmer Library, which will now be open to walk-in visitors, giving anyone and everyone access to one of the city's most dreamily atmospheric 19th-century spaces.
"We're going to have esteemed scholars doing research on all kinds of topics next to teenagers who are on their way back from school, researching for a school project," Jean-Louis said, as well as people who might come for a quick selfie -- "by all means," she said -- but stay for something else.
The old historical society had hardly been a bastion of narrow, upper-crusty history, but evolved over the decades toward a broad-based social history. (One of the last shows before the merger focused on Muslims in Brooklyn, drawing on an ambitious oral history project.)
"Brooklyn Is ..." extends the inclusive, ground-up approach, offering what Jean-Louis (who joined the center in April from the New-York Historical Society) called a "stereoscopic view."
It's organized geographically, but hopscotches across themes and periods, with the help of first-person wall texts from community "narrators," including Charlie Sahadi, of the venerable Middle Eastern grocery on Atlantic Avenue; Annie Ferdous, the president of the Bangladeshi Ladies Club, a collective in Kensington; and Elizabeth Sweetheart, famous in Carroll Gardens (and on Instagram) for dressing only in lime green.
Each section is anchored by an archival map, surrounded by photographs from the collection, like Jamel Shabazz's 2009 shot of a sidewalk haircut in Bedford-Stuyvesant, or George Cohen's deadpan 1987 portrait of a paddle-tennis player in Brighton Beach.
A projection wall, operated by a touch-screen map, allows visitors to call up more images, which are drawn from the collection or submitted digitally by ordinary Brooklynites. (A QR code lets you upload your own for consideration.)
There are more images and texts lining the rails outside the building, and plenty of Brooklyn boasts. Who knew the borough had bragging rights to the blackout cake, the curveball, the credit card, the air-conditioner and the deep-fried Twinkie?
But it's not all feel-good boosterism. The East Brooklyn section includes a map from 1953 (the year before the Brown v. Board of Education decision) showing "school utilization" across the borough, with patterns of overcrowding that correlate with residential segregation.
Many people associate integration battles with the South, Jean-Louis said. But New York City has its own history of activism, including a citywide school boycott in 1964 during which roughly 500,000 children stayed home in protest against segregation.
"We're still in one of the most segregated districts in the country," she said. "This maps helps explain why."
Overall, there's a shortage of images of stereotypical Dutch burghers or starchy 19th-century grandees. But visitors can find them upstairs, in the oil paintings hung in the Othmer Library, where Natiba Guy-Clement, the assistant director for collections and public service, had pulled a sampling of treasures from the research collection.
There was iconic Brooklyniana, like a signed 1856 edition of Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass," Washington Roebling's handwritten notes and sketches for the Brooklyn Bridge, and baseballs signed by Jackie Robinson.
But there was also a 1643 deed granting 200 acres of land near Coney Island to Anthony van Salee, the first known person of Muslim origin to settle in America; fliers and pamphlets from the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality; and archival snapshots from the Tribute to the Ancestors, an annual ceremony at Coney Island commemorating the Middle Passage.
The center is also starting a family history initiative, directing people of all backgrounds to resources that can help them find their own ancestors. Genealogy, Jean-Louis said, is many people's entry point into history, which also flows back into scholarly understanding.
"The more people find out about their family history, the more we know about Brooklyn," she said.
It has been claimed -- perhaps by someone trying to sell a bridge -- that as many as one in four Americans can trace some ancestry to Brooklyn. Whatever the math, Johnson said, what Brooklyn, and Brooklyn history, "is" is its people.
"We want people to feel like their stories are important," she said, "because they live here."

Full text: This summer, the owners of the wine and ice cream bar Folderol took a number of measures to manage crowds after their small business experienced an unsolicited wave of TikTok fame.
"They don't even taste the ice cream," Jessica Yang said of the social-media-conscious crowd that descended this summer on Folderol, a natural wine bar and artisanal ice cream parlor in Paris that she owns and operates with her husband, Robert Compagnon. "They just let it pool into a bowl of melting liquid and die in the sun."
In late April, a daily line began to form outside Folderol's red storefront as the business grew in popularity, thanks in large part to TikTok. As the spring bloomed into a summer that saw a record number of tourists traveling to Europe, the lines became longer.
Throughout June and July, tourists and content creators flocked to Folderol, waiting for hours on its otherwise quiet 11th arrondissement street so that they, too, could recreate what they had seen online: fashionable folk sitting on Parisian curbs, eating ice cream from steel coupes, smoking cigarettes and swigging wine.
Both 37-year-old chefs, Ms. Yang and Mr. Compagnon met in Paris in 2010 while working in the kitchen of the highly acclaimed restaurant Guy Savoy. Mr. Compagnon, who is French American, and Ms. Yang, who is Taiwanese American, spent the next few years between Paris and New York City, working at restaurants including Le Jules Verne, Momofuku Ko, Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare and Per Se.
The couple opened Folderol in December 2020, one door down from their intimate Michelin-star-winning restaurant, Le Rigmarole. As new parents, they were inspired to start a family friendly business. "We wanted it to be a place where parents and kids could go and have fun," Ms. Yang said about their hopes for Folderol. "Parents could have a glass of wine; kids could have some ice cream."
Because of coronavirus restrictions, when Folderol opened, it was takeout-only. Customers would pick up a bottle from the bar's curated selection of small-batch natural wines or a pint of seasonally inspired ice cream, hand-churned by Ms. Yang in a labor-intensive, 48-hour process.
As the pandemic eased, customers were allowed inside Folderol, but given its limited indoor seating and the al fresco dining culture of Paris, many patrons chose to eat and drink outside. This gave rise to Folderol's curbside aesthetic, which garnered mass appeal on TikTok.
"So I keep seeing people post photos and videos from this place in Paris called Folderol, and I've honestly never felt like I needed to go someplace more than I do right now," Anna Hyclak, a 35-year-old American living in London, said in a TikTok video in June. "Spiritually, it is calling to me. Like, I feel like it would cure my depression to sit on these sidewalks."
Ms. Hyclak's reel garnered over 20,000 likes and 167 comments, most lamenting Folderol's viral fame. One TikTok user wrote: "I live really close to this place and it's totally impossible to go now. The line is huge and full of teenagers/TikTokers at all times." Another commented: "I went and it felt like a photo shoot set. Like I'm sure it was amazing before but now it's all the fashion girlies going there for content."
Many of Folderol's longtime customers were put off by the crowd. "Last summer I used to come in all the time," said Samantha Luevano, a 27-year-old copywriter in Paris. "I used to sit outside and eat my ice cream and drink wine casually. There'd be like five people here." This summer, Ms. Luevano chose to pick up pints of ice cream and bottles of wine at Folderol instead of dining in because, she said, the hectic atmosphere caused her "anxiety."
Mr. Compagnon likened the situation to "running a marathon in flip flops." Their small operation struggled to keep up with demand. Frustrated clients started leaving the business negative reviews. The pretty ice cream coupes, which the owners found at Parisian flea markets, began to go missing. On four occasions, neighbors called the police about the crowd.
"We wanted our reputation to be based on the quality of the food and what we produce," Mr. Compagnon said. "We didn't see this coming."
In late May, Ms. Yang and Mr. Compagnon began instituting a series of measures, which they call "roadblocks," in an attempt to regain control of Folderol.
First, they decreased the number of wine glasses they had available to put a cap on the number of customers they could serve at once. Then they hired a bouncer to help their staff with crowd control. Next, they put up signs to the right of Folderol's front door that read, in English: "No TikTok" and "Be here to have fun, not to take pictures."
In July, they banned guests from sitting outside entirely -- an unpopular measure with those who had come just to pose. "'Oh, we can't sit outside and take pictures?"' Mr. Compagnon said, imitating customers who were not aware of Folderol's new rules. "And so they just leave."
While Folderol was on its annual August break, the pop star Dua Lipa named Folderol as one of her "favorite French restaurants" in a Vogue France video. Despite Ms. Lipa's shout-out, the atmosphere was noticeably calmer when Folderol reopened on August 30. "We're feeling better," Mr. Compagnon said. "People seem to be much more understanding."
Bianca de la Luna, a 25-year-old model from Germany, visited Folderol the day it reopened. After admitting that she had learned about Folderol on TikTok, Ms. de la Luna whispered, "I don't want to say that too loud in here."
"I'd love to take the Instagram picture with the ice cream and wine," said her friend Huy Nguyen, an 18-year-old art student. "But now it's forbidden."

A Leader Learns the Value of Slowing Down: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After founding a nonprofit organization to end "period poverty," and then a Gen Z menstrual-products company, Nadya Okamoto has learned the value of slowing down.
As a teenager in Portland, Ore., Nadya Okamoto remembers speaking with homeless women near her local bus stop about a little-discussed subject. "I asked them, 'What's a challenge that you are dealing with?' And it was not having access to period products," she said. "It consistently came up, and I had never thought of it."
She did research and discovered a host of problems: the "tampon tax," school absenteeism, and the fact that food stamps did not cover menstrual products in many states. At age 16 she founded PERIOD, a nonprofit organization working to end "period poverty" and stigma through policy advocacy and by directly distributing menstrual products.
Ms. Okamoto became a highly visible leader, posting candid video diaries on TikTok, where she now has over 4 million followers. She ran for public office in Cambridge, Mass., as a 19-year-old Harvard undergraduate; at 20, she published a book, "Period Power: A Manifesto for the Menstrual Movement."
All this activity and attention came at a cost. She replaced herself as executive director of PERIOD in early 2020, and a wave of criticism on social media pushed her to breaking point.
"For a couple of years before, I was traveling two to three times a week, and I was really running away from all my trauma," said Ms. Okamoto, now 25. "And then the Covid situation of being at a standstill made me deal with that," she said, adding that she had received online death threats.
Raised in Manhattan until she was 9, Ms. Okamoto moved back to the city and completed her degree remotely, and in June 2021 her new company, August, started selling sustainable menstrual products that appeal to Gen Z. "August means majestic dignity, and dignity was a word that kept coming up in our brand brainstorms," she said. "Also, we are proudly gender- and trans-inclusive, and we really wanted a gender-inclusive name."
She now strives to make her mental health a priority. Her Sundays in Downtown Brooklyn, where she lives with her boyfriend, Henry Stevenson, 31, and their poodle-Wheaten terrier mix, Mimi, are focused on self-care routines in addition to work.
ORDER UP I usually wake up around 9 on weekends. This is new for me because I used to sleep two hours a night and down a Red Bull. Henry and I roll out of bed and go to Konditori on Smith Street with Mimi. I know it's a Swedish coffeehouse, but Konditori bagels are so delicious. We have our order: I always get the Runner, which is a sesame bagel with avocado and egg and cheese, and Henry will get a toasted sesame with cream cheese. I get an Americano with almond milk and he gets a drip coffee with oat milk.
HAPPY PLACE From there, we'll walk to Pier 6, which has a dog run. We just hang out with Mimi until she's exhausted, and then we walk back. It's so funny, because I've done hypnotherapy and all these different modes of therapy where I'll have to do guided meditations or reflections on my happy place. And my happy place used to be a made-up place, like a hammock on a beach. And now my happy place is the dog run. It's sitting with my little coffee on the concrete ledge around all the dog pee, and watching Mimi play with the other dogs.
SWEAT IT OUT I'm very into my hot yoga. I go to Vera Yoga on Atlantic Avenue. They all know me there and they stock August in their bathroom. What I love about it is it's not like Bikram, where it's very set. You get to flow on your own, so a lot of it is whatever you want it to be.
STINGS SO GOOD I'm learning to treat myself on all self-care things, and I'm very dedicated about my facials. I'll ride my bike to Julie Lindh by the Flatiron and she gives me bee venom facials. The whole thing is bringing blood flow to the surface level of your skin to help with dark spots, acne, things like that. My skin has always been really neglected, and then I started having -- especially when I was in the stress of the start-up -- a lot of acne and blackheads. I've also been doing microneedling with her, where she literally tattoos my face with stem cells and I come back looking like Deadpool. Sometimes I bring Mimi in a little doggy backpack on my bike, and she'll sit on my lap and watch while I get the facial.
FAMILIAR MEAL I eat the same thing every night for dinner. I make scrambled eggs with spinach and some sort of carb, like rice or quinoa, in it, with some mayo and sriracha. And a green smoothie. My friends make fun of me. I definitely don't cook -- I make food.
WORK CATCH-UP After dinner, I'm writing emails or podcasting in my bedroom. My podcast is called "Tigris." My second book, I think, is also going to be called "Tigris." I have my full manuscript ready to go, and I've been in the pitch process for that. But Sundays are when I'm lining up a lot of content for the week.
SUNDAY SKIN SPECIAL I have my whole skin care routine: I wash my face, I have a serum, an essence, two different types of oils and then a moisturizer. And then sometimes I'll put a mask over it, because it's Sunday.
Sunday Routine readers can follow Nadya Okamoto on Instagram, TikTok and X at @nadyaokamoto.

Card Games Helped Set the Table for Love: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Morgan Hoit and Dylan Pager, who met at work seven years ago, enlisted their roommates in organizing a game night. The hangout went so well that the two deleted their dating apps.
When Dylan Pager first met Morgan Landfair Hoit at work in November 2016, he thought she was cute. Ms. Hoit, a new graduate of Duke, had just started her job in the theater industry, and the assistant she was replacing brought her to the management office to meet her new colleagues. "It didn't cross my mind to mix work and dating," Mr. Pager said.
Ms. Hoit, 29, was an assistant to Jill Furman, one of the producers of the Broadway musical "Hamilton," at her production company. Mr. Pager, 31, worked for Baseline Theatrical, a theatrical management company, overseeing the house seats for "Hamilton."
Over the next three years, they saw each other infrequently, mostly on Ms. Hoit's runs to the management office to pick up her boss's mail. Then Ms. Hoit announced in a group email that she was changing career paths for a job in book publishing. Mr. Pager wrote back to congratulate her and said they should meet for a drink.
"By then, I had begun to hear about NYC Book Girl," he said of Ms. Hoit's Instagram account dedicated to books. "I wanted to hear more about that and I wanted to say farewell." Friendship, not romance, was the goal. "I liked Morgan, but I really didn't have any other motives," Mr. Pager said.

After they met up, in August 2019, Ms. Hoit wished that was otherwise. They had drinks at Bean & Barley, an Irish pub that has since closed, near the apartment Ms. Hoit shared with two roommates in South Harlem. "We were really talking and connecting, and we realized we had all this stuff in common," Ms. Hoit said. Topping the list was a love of games: She had a deck of the Monopoly Deal card game in her bag that they played for hours.
Later that night, back in her fifth-floor walk-up, she told her roommates, "Hmm, I think that was a date." On the way back to his Upper West Side apartment, Mr. Pager was knocked sideways by a flood of unexpected feelings. He, too, confided in his two roommates.
"I told them I was caught off guard by the evening," he said. "I've always been so cautious about crossing the line with friends, because I really value my friends." But over the next couple of days, as the two started exchanging texts, "I was really in my head as to whether we were friends, or was this going to be more."
Ms. Hoit grew up in Summit, N.J., and Mr. Pager in West Harrison, N.Y. Both describe themselves as theater kids. He majored in theater at Northwestern, graduating in 2015 with a bachelor's degree, and she double majored in English and theater studies at Duke. Ms. Hoit is now the associate director of social media at Atria Books. Mr. Pager is a 2023 Tony nominee for executive producing the Broadway play "Fat Ham," and he is the director of producing and creative development at No Guarantees, a production company.
When the two wanted an excuse to see each other again, they enlisted their roommates for help.
"On our date-not-date it became clear she loved playing games with her roommates and I with mine, so we talked about how it would be fun to do a roommate game night," Mr. Pager said. "A natural follow-up text was, 'We should definitely get that game night going."'
At the end of August, the Harlem crew brought Azul, a strategy board game, with them to the Upper West Side. Mr. Pager and his roommates provided Codenames and Anomia, both card games. The hangout went well enough that by October, the duo deleted their dating apps.
The following year, at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, they were too in love to quarantine apart. First, they stayed with Mr. Pager's parents in Westchester County, N.Y., and then at Ms. Hoit's parents' house in Chatham, Mass.
On Aug. 21, 2022, Mr. Pager proposed after they had been living together on the Upper West Side for a little over a year. As he got down on one knee in Riverside Park, their four parents hid and watched from behind the trees. "It's right behind our apartment, and it had become very special to us," Mr. Pager said of the spot.
Ms. Hoit called her instant yes a "no-brainer," one with "crying, lots of crying," she said. "There's no part of me that stayed up all night thinking about how crazy it is we're getting married. There was no fear or anxiety about taking that step. We were ready."
On Sept. 2, they proved it in front of 250 guests at 99 Scott Studio, an events space in Brooklyn. Garrett Baer, Mr. Pager's best friend, who was previously ordained by the Universal Life Church, officiated a nonreligious ceremony, featuring a huppah and the breaking of glass to honor Mr. Pager's Jewish background. Ms. Hoit's game night roommates were in her bridal party of six; Mr. Pager's were among his seven groomsmen.
At a post reception after-party, they all had a chance to play games, where -- in addition to Monopoly Deal -- the couple surprised their guests with playing cards featuring their photo on each deck.

So Many Hurdles to Fit the News in Print: [Metropolitan Desk]

Author: Bahr, Sarah

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a few months writing (and rewriting) headlines for the front page of The New York Times, one journalist has some takeaways.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was my first night working as an editor on the Print Hub, the team of New York Times planners, editors and designers who produce the daily print newspaper, and my first thought was: Is the job really so ... easy?
Reader, I was quickly humbled.
This group of about 70 journalists is responsible for taking articles that have been published online and adapting them to appear in print. Print Hub editors give articles another copy edit (which is especially crucial for breaking news filed late in the day), write captions for photos and cut or rewrite text for the paper. They have to do it all before the unforgiving deadline of 5 p.m., when the first edition of the newspaper gets sent to the printer. (For context: Some articles are not filed until 4:30 p.m.)
One of the trickiest parts of the job is crafting headlines. Online, a headline has looser space restrictions. But a print headline must fit in a defined, tight space; even one extra letter can require a wholesale rewrite. There are some tricks: For example, there are many ways to say "Supreme Court" to fit into spaces of varying lengths (e.g., "justices," "top court").
The article I was assigned, a 260-word politics dispatch, seemed straightforward enough. I wrote a headline in five minutes: "Biden Says Re-election / Campaign Is in the Cards." (The slash indicates where the headline breaks on a new line.)
If you are a print veteran, you immediately see the problem here. Kren Phillips, an editor for the Print Hub, certainly did, and she gently pointed it out: I'd split a phrase. Each line of a headline should be able to stand alone as a single thought, meaning any line other than the final one should generally end with a noun or an action verb.
I tried again: "Biden Says He Plans to Run / for Re-election in 2024."
Except now, I'd violated another rule: The first word of every line needs to be capitalized. To make matters worse, the second line was short; headlines should fill the allotted space exactly.
"Does 'For President Again in 2024' fit?" for the second line, Kren wrote in a Slack message.
Of course it did. That kind of problem-solving happens nearly all night, every night, as Print Hub editors update later editions of the newspaper.
Life in the Hub is governed by a few rules: Generally don't use full names in headlines, other than in obituaries. Always put "New York City" on one line (never "N.Y.C."). These rules may seem arcane, but they keep the newspaper consistent -- and hold The Times to a high standard.
All of this was a bit of a shock for me. I'm an editor on The Times's digitally focused Flexible Editing desk, a pool of 18 or so editors who edit copy from across the newsroom, including some story forms, such as newsletters, Instagram posts and video captions, that don't appear in print. Editors on the Flex desk, as we call it, also fill in on other teams, which is how I ended up on my three-month stint at the Print Hub.
In college and during my first journalism job as a digital producer and trending news reporter, I focused on digital-first skills like social media and search engine optimization -- the process of writing a headline with keywords that people are searching for online. Newspaper terms like bulldog (the first edition of the Sunday newspaper) and A-hed (a one-column headline that appears on the top right of the front page) were old-school. And while deadlines on the digital report can be demanding, especially during breaking news, I learned that on the Print Hub, they're dictatorial. They come on holidays, weekends and during power outages.
One of the most important tasks of a Print Hub editor is trimming text to fit in a limited amount of space. On the Flex desk, I'll often streamline an article, but in the Print Hub, an article can easily arrive 400 words too long. Print Hub editors work through the copy, making small cuts -- changing "according to" to "said," for instance -- and big ones, such as eliminating entire quotes.
I picked up other skills as well: Stacy China, an editor who often oversees the International section, taught me the importance of photo captions. A good one is specific and avoids vague language.
There was a lot to learn in a brief stretch of time. But I couldn't have asked for better guides, who mentored me as I brought up the rear. Samantha Farlow, who oversees the print report at night, has a knack for taking a so-so front-page headline and making it sparkle. The editor Sean Ernst writes headlines that I could never match even after spending whole days brainstorming (he has deservedly won numerous headline writing awards).
Though the print world was new to me, I brought some skills from Flex that proved useful: Writing tweets for almost every article I edited had honed my ability to quickly summarize the essence of a story. My Saturday night shifts in Flex had resulted in a practiced eye at scrutinizing copy for outdated time references (e.g. "this week," "today").
And I brought some knowledge back with me. In the two months since I've returned to my day job, I've been industrious in trying to write compelling headlines. I'm more conscious of captions, making sure that they give readers context beyond what they can see in a photo.
And now I know: The job of Print Hub editors is hard.
They just make it look easy.

Alfredo Martinez, 56, Who Fused Art World And Underworld, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Alfredo Martinez lived on New York City's margins, a squatter who shook off one eviction after another. He was an artist who usually lacked a gallery and sometimes put on exhibits in a storage locker.
Yet Mr. Martinez was also a player in the world capital of culture and media.
He mastered a few artistic techniques. He had the chutzpah to break the rules. He saw that criminality could be a neighbor of fame. And he talked in the colorful manner that makes journalists listen.
Mr. Martinez synthesized those qualities into an idiosyncratic strategy as a bohemian provocateur: Use prison to supercharge an art career.
He did that in the early 2000s, after he pleaded guilty to art forgery. And with his guidance, Anna Sorokin transformed herself from a celebrity scammer being held in an immigration detention facility into an artist selling pencil and acrylic drawings for $ 10,000 a pop.
It was one of many ways Mr. Martinez brought together New York's art world and underworld.
He died on Aug. 21 at his home in Newark, where he had moved recently seeking space and stability, his brother, Javier, said. He was 56. Mr. Martinez had been treated for diabetes and an infection in his right leg that led to a series of amputations, beginning with his big toe and culminating above the knee.
Mr. Martinez's education in staging transgressive, carnivalesque art spectacles began when he was in his late 20s and 30s.
In 1999, the tech mogul Josh Harris offered dozens of arty acquaintances a month's room and board in a downtown Manhattan bunker in exchange for the right to film everything they did. There was sex, drugs, military-style interrogations and, surreally, a well-stocked arsenal of guns and a shooting range. Mr. Martinez, credited as the "artillery artist," set that up. (His role in the project was later recorded in "We Live in Public," a documentary by Ondi Timoner.)
Around the same time, Mr. Martinez was curating group art shows, generally drawing work from artists he knew and using ersatz galleries that did not outlive the shows themselves. In 2000, one exhibit, "Na'er Do Wells," featured some unusually valuable objects: a drawing and a painted chair back by Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Basquiat's art gave Mr. Martinez an idea.
"I just knew instinctively it was something I could forge," he told The Village Voice in 2007. "It was such an easy way to make a quick 20 grand."
Using the Basquiats that appeared in "Na'er Do Wells" and their authentication papers as models, Mr. Martinez began a forgery operation. He sold two fake Basquiats to the New York art dealer Lio Malca, Artnet reported, and he approached two other dealers with offers.
That led to his arrest. Mr. Martinez pleaded guilty to wire fraud, according to Artnet, and was sentenced to more than two years in prison.
He saw the punishment as an opportunity. "Jail," he was fond of telling journalists in the years to come, "was a publicity stunt."
During his trial and imprisonment, he became a figure on gossipy Page Six of The New York Post. In October 2003, The Post reported, Mr. Martinez "managed to smuggle his jailhouse art -- painted using coffee, Kool-Aid and fruit juice -- to a Chelsea gallery" called the Proposition Gallery. The listed price of his works was $ 150,000.
In January the next year, the writer and art critic Anthony Haden-Guest reported in New York magazine that Mr. Martinez's work had appeared in four shows, including solo exhibitions in New York and Paris.
His prison works included cartoonish but detailed drawings of guns and a portrait of himself on a hunger strike strapped to a gurney preparing to be force-fed.
Many years after his release, Mr. Martinez was still trading on the glamour of his crime, introducing himself to a journalist from Insider by saying, "I'm a notorious art forger."
By then, he had found a new opportunity for his art-crime hucksterism.
In May 2020, Anna Sorokin was in the midst of a 4-to-12-year prison sentence for financial crimes. She had been the subject of magazine profiles, tabloid gossip and news coverage for posing as a German heiress named Anna Delvey and swindling banks, hotels and associates out of about $ 200,000. Now she had begun doing something new: having her friends post on Instagram self-portraits that she had drawn in prison.
Julia Morrison, a friend of Mr. Martinez's and a fellow artist, showed him Ms. Sorokin's work, pointing out that, like Mr. Martinez, Ms. Sorokin was a con artist turned artist.
They tried reaching out to her.
"It was impossible to get ahold of her," Mr. Martinez told Insider, speaking of Ms. Sorokin. "So what I did was, I planted some story in Page Six to get her attention."
In March 2021, while Ms. Sorokin was on parole, Page Six announced that "noted artist and curator Alfredo Martinez" had "fallen in love" with Ms. Sorokin's drawings.
Now Ms. Sorokin replied to Ms. Morrison and Mr. Martinez. The group began planning an exhibit.
Days after the Post article came out, Immigration and Customs Enforcement took Ms. Sorokin into custody for overstaying her visa. She faced the same difficulty that Mr. Martinez once had in making art while incarcerated. He came up with a solution: printing out images of her works and copying them, using the same tracing method with which he had forged Basquiat.
On March 17 last year -- soon after the release of "Inventing Anna," a Netflix mini-series about Ms. Sorokin -- a crowd of skateboarders, party people, curiosity seekers, contemporary art fans and journalists gathered in a shuttered downtown Manhattan storefront. It was a classic Alfredo Martinez group show and art spectacle.
"Free Anna Delvey!" the crowd chanted.
Ms. Sorokin called Mr. Martinez. He put her on speaker and held his phone aloft. Ms. Morrison told the crowd to shut up and listen.
Mr. Martinez smiled. Once again, he had New York's attention.
Alfredo Martinez was born on April 15, 1967, in Brooklyn, to Alfredo and Sonia (Pereyra) Martinez. The family ran a junk store in Brooklyn, and they lived behind the store. Alfredo ran away from home as a teenager.
In addition to his brother, Mr. Martinez is survived by his father and two sisters, Sonia and Christine Martinez.
Some who followed Mr. Martinez's career called him a publicity hound. Curators asking around about him were advised to stay away. Even friends like Ms. Morrison often found themselves feeling exploited.
But it's not hard to find people eager to discuss not only Mr. Martinez's chicanery and showmanship, but also his artwork itself.
One of Mr. Martinez's preoccupations was making aluminum casts of pistols, revolvers and machine guns; it was among his techniques for using gun parts to create menacing yet toylike sculptures. In an interview, Mr. Haden-Guest called them "genuinely peculiar and unusual."
He added that Mr. Martinez might turn out to fit a familiar type: the troublemaker who posthumously gains renown as a serious artist.
"An artist with an unruly kind of life, a street life, who people find hard to accept in their lives -- bang, when they're dead, they're there," he said. "They're part of art history."

Full text: In the first full day of testimony in the U.S. monopoly trial against Google, the Justice Department sought to show that the company had long tried to cut out search competitors.
The Justice Department used its first full day of questioning in its antitrust trial against Google on Wednesday to establish that the internet giant had long sought agreements to be the default search engine on mobile devices, which the government argues were used to illegally maintain the company's hold over online search.
Google responded by highlighting evidence suggesting that companies that signed those agreements -- including smartphone makers, browser developers and wireless carriers -- did so partly because its search product was better.
Chris Barton, a former Google employee who testified on Wednesday, said the company had been willing to pay mobile companies mainly to become their exclusive default search engine. "That's the kind of primary goal of the partnership," he said of the agreements.
The testimony came after the federal government's first monopoly trial of the modern internet era kicked off on Tuesday. The Justice Department and a group of 38 states and territories have accused Google of illegally shutting out competitors and entrenching a monopoly over online search by using multibillion-dollar contracts with companies like Apple and Samsung to be the default search engine on smartphones.
Google has argued that its success in online search was the result of having a better product, not the default agreements. In opening statements on Tuesday, Google's lawyer said it was easy for people to switch their search engine and that smartphone and browser makers promoted other search engines as well.
Any ruling in the trial, which is scheduled to last 10 weeks, could have wide implications for a technology industry that has defined communications, culture and the search for information online. A government victory could limit Google, a $ 1.7 trillion company, and put other tech giants on notice.
The case is likely to be the first of several government monopoly trials against the biggest tech companies. The Justice Department has filed a second lawsuit against Google, arguing it abused a monopoly over advertising technology, and the Federal Trade Commission is pursuing a case against Meta claiming it snuffed out nascent competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp.
On Wednesday, the Justice Department began the day in court by questioning Mr. Barton, who worked at Google forging agreements with mobile companies. He was asked about how Google's early agreements with telecommunications providers and smartphone manufacturers prioritized exclusivity as a default search engine on mobile devices.
Mr. Barton's job had been to meet with executives from the telecom and smartphone makers, convince them to sign agreements to distribute Google search and see those agreements through to a final contract, he said. The goal was to "maximize the opportunity" for users to discover Google and start to use it regularly, he said.
Google also paid some mobile phone makers and telecommunications carriers a share of its revenue as part of the agreements. "The key thing" determining whether another company was paid was if it would agree to make Google its default search engine exclusively, Mr. Barton said.
John Schmidtlein, Google's lead litigator, used his questions to suggest that the quality of the company's search engine was important to those that signed the search distribution agreements.
In one 2009 email, Mr. Barton speculated to a colleague that T-Mobile might consider switching its default search engine to Google because of Google's strong brand, among other factors. Mr. Barton also told Mr. Schmidtlein that when he pitched other companies, he tended to focus on Google's "superior product" and "superior monetization."
The Justice Department then called Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, who had testified on Tuesday about the power of being the default search engine and how Google viewed its position in the market.
Kenneth Dintzer, the government's lead lawyer, asked Mr. Varian about debates he had with other Google employees over whether or not the company's significant scale and data troves gave it an advantage over rivals.
Mr. Varian at times sparred with colleagues who thought he was being too dismissive of the role that data played as a competitive advantage for the search engine, according to internal documents displayed during the government's questioning.
Antonio Rangel, a behavioral economist and professor at Caltech, who the government has employed as an expert witness, also testified that using defaults was an effective tactic to get a user to make a certain choice.
"The consensus is that defaults have a powerful influence on consumer decisions," he said, adding that he believed having a default search engine on a device, like a smartphone or personal computer, would bias users toward choosing that search engine in a "sizable and robust" way.
The trial is expected to run through November and feature testimony from executives at Google, Apple and other companies. Some of the testimony is likely to be sealed to the public because it involves information that businesses consider confidential. A portion of the evidence displayed in court has also been redacted.

House Arrest Can't Stop a Host: [Style Desk]

Full text: Shao took a novel approach to attracting an audience for its debut.
How far would you go to get attention for your work?
It is notoriously hard to be a young designer, or even an independent designer. It's no longer enough just to make good stuff or have an original idea. You need to break through the noise long enough to grab the focus of the fractured world so people (the ones who may wear your clothes, or buy them, or post about them on Instagram or TikTok) look long enough and closely enough to notice what is special.
Some designers, like Piotrek Panszczyk of Area, do it by being as blingtastically absurd as possible, attracting an audience willing to gussy themselves up in rhinestone bikinis and sheer body stockings in the light of day. What better look for taking selfies while applauding a meditation on the cave man nature of capitalism via Krystle Carrington puffers made to look like minks and crystal gowns with jutting femurs between the seams?
Others do it with noise, like LaQuan Smith, who doused his bass notes and bombast in light blue this season and added a wind machine but otherwise stuck to his usual bodylicious script.
But until this season no one has done it with the help of a notorious society grifter and fake German heiress currently under house arrest.
On Monday, Anna Delvey (real name Sorokin), who became famous for conning a swath of New York rich, was later immortalized by Julia Garner in a Netflix series and served almost four years in prison, was a co-host of the fashion show debut of Shao, a genderless suiting-meets-streetwear-meets-corsetry label founded by Shao Yang.
And she didn't just lend her (fake) name to the invitation: She lent her address too, co-hosting the event at her East Village walk-up. (Well, until her immigration case is resolved, Ms. Sorokin can't leave the building.) Actually, it was on the silver-painted tar-papered roof of her East Village walk-up. Her apartment is too small for a fashion show.
The show was the brainchild of Kelly Cutrone, a fashion publicist who was the subject of the 2010 Bravo reality show "Kell on Earth." Ms. Cutrone had invited Ms. Sorokin to team up on a "pop-up P.R. agency" they christened OutLaw (really), the better to exploit her brand equity for the benefit of someone else -- and, perhaps, start rehabbing her reputation at the same time. Ms. Sorokin does, after all, have a history in understanding the way fashion could be used to manipulate those around her.
"It's so hard for new designers to get any attention, and I can just get publicity -- bad publicity, any publicity, just for taking out garbage," Ms. Sorokin said before the show, sitting in her apartment, which was jammed with a film crew from Germany making a documentary on her life, the same way her fridge is jammed with LaCroix seltzers. Not that she is really shying away from the publicity. (She does still call herself Delvey.) "We're just trying to channel it into something positive," she said.
The fairly cynical theory: Sure, the fashion world would come for the novelty of gawking at the co-host, but at least they'd come. And if they came, they'd have to see the clothes.
The plan worked, to a certain extent. Olivier Zahm, the ever-white-jeaned editor of Purple magazine, was there, eyeing the scene from behind his trademark tinted aviators. So was the pop singer Slayyyter. So was Nicola Formichetti, Lady Gaga's collaborator, who had moved back to New York from Los Angeles just three days before. He said that even though he hadn't been to a fashion show for a while, he came for Anna because "I've been fascinated with her for so long and been waiting for what she's going to do next, like everyone else." He also said he thought the name of the pop-up agency was "genius." (Ms. Sorokin said she thought it was "funny.")
Mr. Formichetti, along with a motley gang of black-clad fashion people who had gathered outside the building on First Avenue, huffed up the six flights of stairs to the roof. There were about 100 guests, Ms. Cutrone said. The models, one of whom was toting a fuzzy little dog that had been dyed pink, arrived by party bus since there wasn't enough room in Ms. Sorokin's apartment for hair and makeup.
Once inside, they crammed into the narrow hallways waiting for their turn on the roof (they posed against the egress door). One of Ms. Sorokin's neighbors, who had apparently not been alerted about what was happening and was somewhat startled by the crowd when she arrived home with her groceries, asked everyone to please be quiet so as not to scare her dog. Then Guns N' Roses started to blast from the speakers set up on the roof.
"It's a bit intrusive," Ms. Sorokin admitted, having all these strangers in her building. "But I've also been to jail, and it's really intrusive there too. We'll clean it up." Anyway, her lease was about to be up, she said, and she was going to have to move. Ms. Sorokin was wearing a Shao black tuxedo with legs long enough to hide her ankle monitor and shoulders encrusted with rhinestones. She materialized briefly on the roof to welcome everyone and pose for photos before going back inside. The tux was something of a preview of the collection, which had a Gaultier-meets-Off-White vibe in black and white and highlighter yellow. Ms. Yang, whose family emigrated from Taiwan when she was 5, graduated from Parsons and has spent the last nine years running the Tailory, a custom suit company. She knows what she is doing.
"Not everyone would be cool with it -- with us, probably, getting more attention than their work," Ms. Sorokin acknowledged. Some might also not be cool with knowing that the first thing most people know about their work is an association with a famous scammer.
Others, however, might say it's exactly the place fashion, an industry with famously fungible morals that tends to the Warholian and finds it impossible to resist the siren call of social media, has been heading.
"There are no more rules," Ms. Cutrone said. "All bets are off now."

Full text: Great fries take time, effort and a lot of space.
There are many good things to eat at Libertine, a new French bistro in the West Village that I reviewed this week. But there's one French-bistro standby you will not find there.
"We're not serving fries," Cody Pruitt, one of the owners, told Pamela Vachon of Resy. "You can get fries anywhere."
Maybe that's true. But we don't want the kind of fries you can get anywhere. No, we want great fries. We want fries that, once you've eaten the first one, dominate your consciousness until they are gone. Fries so powerful no amount of Ozempic will silence them. Fewer than 20 restaurants in New York put out fries like that.
The children of Balthazar
For consistency over the long haul, influence over other fry-making restaurants and sheer tonnage of potatoes, we should probably start in SoHo, with Balthazar.
The fries at Balthazar are famous. Your Aunt Sharon in Rapid City has heard about the fries at Balthazar, and has probably watched one of the videos on YouTube demonstrating how they are made. The technique involves peeling russet potatoes, pressing them through a hand-powered French fry cutter, and rinsing them overnight. The next day they are drained, dried, fried at a moderate temperature, allowed to rest, fried again at a higher temperature and tossed with salt.
Crunchy outside, creamy inside, Balthazar fries rarely bend and are never limp. Somehow they taste more like potatoes -- well, potatoes and salt -- than most other fries.
The authors of this method are Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr, who oversaw all the McNally kitchens from 1997 until 2013. Two of Balthazar's younger siblings in Keith McNally's company, Pastis, in the Meatpacking District, and Minetta Tavern, in Greenwich Village, follow the Balthazar template.
Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr use it today at their own restaurants, Frenchette, in TriBeCa, and Le Rock, in Midtown, with some modifications. (The potatoes are cut a little thicker, for instance.) A Frenchette or Le Rock fry is like a remix of a Balthazar fry, with a heavier groove.
The fries at Corner Bar and Altro Paradiso (both owned by the chef Ignacio Mattos) are very similar -- to each other, and to the specimens Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr serve. Corner Bar, between Chinatown and the Lower East Side, and Altro Paradiso, west of SoHo, achieve an exterior crisp shell encasing potatoes that are less fluffy than smooth, almost like a purée. They use the double-frying method, too, but after the first trip through the oil they go into the freezer. (Frenchette and Le Rock cool theirs on sheet trays in the kitchen.)
Taking the French out of the fries
Altro Paradiso, being an Italian restaurant, calls its fries patate fritte. But its fries are solidly, recognizably French. And if we are really going to talk about the great fries in this city, we need to expand our range to Belgian frites and English chips.
My first choice for the fatter, mayonnaise-loving Belgian model is Mark's Off Madison, in the Flatiron District, even though the owner, Mark Strausman, says he learned his recipe in Amsterdam in the 1980s. The potatoes are cut by knife to the width of an index finger -- thicker than the fries of the other restaurants. From there, the technique is a double-frying, very similar to the Balthazar method.
"The true, true key is peanut oil," Mr. Strausman said. (The restaurants in the Balthazar lineage use peanut oil, too; Corner Bar and Altro Paradiso blend equal parts peanut oil and canola oil for the second frying.)
For English chips, I like the ones served at Hawksmoor, in the Gramercy Park area, which are misted at the last minute with malt vinegar, and I really like the ones served at Dame and Lord's, sister restaurants in Greenwich Village. All three places follow a triple-cooking method pioneered by the English chef Heston Blumenthal. I won't go into it here, but Ed Szymanski, an owner of Dame and Lord's, calls it "quite an operation." He also stresses the importance of hand-cutting -- English chips should be irregular. I know the off-kilter widths and odd angles are one of the things I enjoy when chips appear at Dame or Lord's.
Where to look for me
I keep all kinds of restaurant lists. One of them, updated constantly, keeps track of newer places that intrigue me. Here's a way shorter version of that list.
Mitica , Greenpoint
When Mariscos El Submarino's bruisingly spicy, inky-dark aguachile negro showed up in 2021, all the fluke crudos around town instantly seemed about as cool as a "live, laugh, love" wall hanging. The food at Mitica, run by the same owners, is more varied and cheffed-up. There's a reprise of the aguachile negro, with butterflied raw shrimp alternating with curves of charred avocado. That soy-darkened marinade, though, is just as uncompromising.
Sartiano's , SoHo
Yes, Sartiano's is fancy Italian in a SoHo hotel. On the other hand, it's guided by Alfred Portale, having a late-career renaissance, with Chris Lewnes as the executive chef. The kitchen seems to be able to look at any ingredient -- even the zucchini wheels among the squid and rock shrimp in a tempura-like fritto misto -- then find flavors in it that other kitchens might miss.

A Bathtub in the Kitchen? Not a Problem for New Yorkers.

NEW YORK — Many New York City renters will recognize this scenario: You’re on your fourth apartment tour of the day when a broker unlocks the front door and ushers you into the kitchen. The layout seems unremarkable at first glance, until your eyes dart to the corner. Wait, is that a bathtub?
Often used as an example of what New Yorkers must endure, navigating an eccentric kitchen has become an experience that unites lifelong residents and uninitiated transplants. Some verge on outlandish, like shoe-box kitchens with showers built into the walls, while others sport anachronistic details, such as a ceremonious 20th-century oven.
Many of the city’s peculiar kitchens are a snapshot of history. After the passage of the New York Tenement House Act of 1901, all residences were required to install a sink and bathtub to meet the city’s sanitation standards. In tenements across the Lower East Side and East Village, bathtubs fit only in the kitchen, often the apartment’s largest room.
Kitchens strapped for space may not include a single full-sized appliance. Despite these quirks, New Yorkers have found ways to make do in — and even fall in love with — their wacky kitchens.
Tiny Appliances, Big Cooking Potential
Everything about this Upper West Side apartment checked the boxes for Phoebe Lifton and her partner, Arthur Cañedo: the proximity to grocery stores, parks and restaurants, the picturesque street views of trees blooming. But when the couple moved into the space in 2020, the kitchen’s setup came as a bit of a shock.
To the untrained eye, Lifton’s kitchen looks as if it has been hit with a shrink ray. The fridge is miniature. The stove, if you can call it that, is just two small countertop burners. There is no oven. Still, the couple was determined to make it work.
They purchased a toaster oven, stashed an additional mini fridge in a closet and invested in an Instant Pot. Taking inspiration from Julia Child, who had her most nifty kitchen tools hung up on a pegboard, Lifton, 32, installed a space-saving corkboard to hold mugs and gadgets.
Even in a kitchen with only a few inches to spare, the couple has cooked enviable meals. They’ve turned to many one-pot recipes like shakshuka and carrot-saffron risotto but have said goodbye to roast chicken and large batches of home-brewed kombucha.
The prolific home cooks haven’t felt hindered by their kitchen, save for the start of the pandemic: “There was a bread-making craze,” Lifton said with a chuckle. “So I could not participate in that, necessarily.”
A Bathtub Fit for a Party
In 2021, Elise Shatz began her apartment hunt with a clear goal: Find the largest apartment within her budget with the best light. She stumbled upon an East Village studio replete with north- and south-facing windows — and a huge bathtub in the kitchen. “The second I walked in, I was like, ‘Yeah, this is my apartment,’” she said.
Most units in her apartment building have kitchen bathtubs, a relic of the tenement era. “If I talk to someone who’s unfamiliar with New York’s real estate, they get confused and think it’s hilarious,” Shatz, 29, said.
Although she rarely takes baths in the tub, she’s eager to use it as a quirky storage spot. “If I were to have a party, I would fill it with ice and put drinks in there,” she said.
A Refrigerator for the Books
When Edythe Hughes settled into her Lower Manhattan apartment in 2021, a certain irritating noise kept her up at night. The culprit was the studio’s lowboy refrigerator, which is typically installed in restaurant kitchens, not residential ones.
“In this small space, it was just too loud,” Hughes, 33, said of the heavy-duty appliance. She chose to unplug it, and doesn’t use it for food. “I use it to store books,” she said. (Hughes purchased a mini fridge to hold her groceries.)
Hughes often enjoys reading her refrigerator-stored books inside the snug bathtub next to the kitchen sink. And storing old calendars and folders in the fridge frees up shelf space for her diverse collection of tchotchkes. No wall is left bare, and that’s how Hughes prefers it.
A Kitchen, Bathroom and Photo Shoot Studio in One
Living with a shower in the kitchen doesn’t faze Nikole Naloy, but her Greenwich Village apartment’s sole sink, shared between the kitchen and bath space, has led to some novel habits. While showering, she can easily access a steamy cup of camomile tea on the counter. Sometimes, she finds herself applying makeup over a pile of dirty dishes.
“It’s kind of luxurious, in a weird way,” she said.
Since moving into the apartment in August, she has also inadvertently transformed the multiuse space into a studio for her freelance photography. The kitchen’s pristine white walls, when contrasted with red kettles and pots, make for an atypical yet striking backdrop. Just days after moving in, Naloy, 23, began taking photos of friends, models and a few bands who, of course, all wanted to pose next to the shower in the kitchen.
“I have these random girls on Instagram hit me up like, ‘Can we do a photo shoot in your bathtub?’” she said.
An Oven Stuck in the Past
Scott Bodenner inherited quite a few antiquated appliances when he bought his Prospect Heights apartment in 1997. There were the kitchen’s original enameled metal cabinets, and the outdated Coldspot refrigerator, which hasn’t been manufactured since the 1970s.
“The whole house seemed like it was stuck in another time and somehow had drifted into our time,” he said.
He left it that way for decades, even though he wasn’t renting. But even after renovating his kitchen during the pandemic, Bodenner, 53, chose not to replace the oldest appliance: his Welbilt oven, produced in 1929.
It lacks a pilot light, so Bodenner fires up the burners with matches or a USB lighter. The real struggle emerges whenever he has to jump-start the oven. “You have to really pull out the broiler drawer and stick your hand up in there and light it,” he said. “It’s still fine, but it’s just a little bit like camping.”
Since renovating, Bodenner has decorated the kitchen with trinkets and personal touches inspired by his travels with his husband, Fabio Toblini. There are dozens of engraved plates and an absurdist painting of the Last Supper with animal heads instead of human ones. In homage to the fountains in Malcesine, Italy, Toblini’s hometown, Bodenner installed a gold dragon-faced faucet above the sink.
“I don’t think there’s another kitchen like ours,” Bodenner said. “But I do think New York is that kind of place to find them.”

TikTok Shop Aims to Turn Influencing Into Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company is beginning to introduce TikTok Shop to all of the app's users in the U.S., hoping to add a major new revenue stream.
TikTok wooed marketers from companies like Madewell, H&M and Gucci last Wednesday as part of New York Fashion Week, transforming the stylish East Village restaurant Cathédrale with a video wall showcasing fashion trends like "little luxuries" and tall mannequins wearing TikTok-inspired styles.
TikTok has cemented itself as an essential advertising venue for brands aiming to reach its young users. But at the party, the marketers were abuzz about TikTok's efforts to sell products from the app itself.
The reason: After nearly a year of testing, speculation and some internal upheaval, TikTok this week is rolling out TikTok Shop for all users in the United States. The company will expand the rollout of a Shop button on the app's home screen, which sends people to a marketplace, and drive traffic to videos that contain Shop buttons for specific products. Both enable users to buy products in a few clicks without leaving the app.
E-commerce is a significant bet for the company, which is hoping to translate the app's power as a cultural trendsetter into another big new revenue stream. But it is a venture that other popular social platforms, including Instagram, have not succeeded with in the United States.
To make it a hit, TikTok said, it is actively driving videos with shopping buttons into users' feed. The company is also, for the time being, giving generous discounts and coupons to users who shop and forgoing commissions from many sellers. TikTok said that it had already signed up 200,000 sellers to TikTok Shop and that more than 100,000 creators could make videos and livestream with shopping buttons.
"We have a very aggressive plan to make a splash in the industry and make sure that people out there understand that TikTok is a place for shopping," Nico Le Bourgeois, one of two executives overseeing TikTok Shop in the United States, said in an interview last week. "We'll be very present for Black Friday and Cyber Monday through a combination of traffic, free shipping and deals." He also said TikTok Shop would run ads on the web and elsewhere.
On Monday, TikTok's Shop button led to a page in the app with a vast array of items. Some were bizarre, like a 27-cent palm-size foldable chair and a $ 5.52 ice crusher with a hand crank. But there was also a section for verified brands like Revolve, Benefit Cosmetics and Otterbox, and products like Air Jordan sneakers.
In main TikTok feeds, creators are increasingly pitching products in videos that bear an orange Shop icon and the label "eligible for commission." People can buy the products with Apple Pay, PayPal or a credit card.
The Shop button, which now appears to 40 percent of users on the main bar of the app's home screen, started rolling out in August and will reach all of TikTok's 150 million U.S. users by early October.
An executive overhaul last month led to questions about the direction of U.S. e-commerce at the company. The person who oversaw the efforts, Sandie Hawkins, left the company for personal reasons, according to an internal memo. Mr. Le Bourgeois, who joined TikTok from Amazon, and Marni Levine, a retail executive who was most recently at Meta, replaced her in the role. They report to Bob Kang, the global e-commerce chief of the Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok.
The company seems to have moved away from an initial focus on promoting shopping through livestreams, a huge industry in Asia that has not found the same resonance in North America, according to several marketers.
Craig Brommers, the chief marketing officer of the retailer American Eagle, said that when the chain tested live shopping events on TikTok in the past year, viewership was "well under what brands are experiencing in Asia-Pacific."
"The initial hypothesis was that live shopping would translate to North America -- we haven't seen that success," Mr. Brommers said. He said his company was keen to learn about other tools from TikTok Shop under its new leadership, especially if it could make it "seamless" for Gen Z shoppers to, say, watch TikTok creators in American Eagle jeans, then buy them in a few clicks.
Mr. Le Bourgeois and Ms. Levine said videos with shopping buttons from brands and creators were now TikTok Shop's main sales driver, though they said live shopping was still a priority and growing in the United States.
Creators who want to sell products from TikTok's marketplace must choose from the assortment of items TikTok has available. Alyssa Pannozzi, an indoor cycling trainer and TikTok personality with more than 200,000 followers, said that when she looked at the sea of products, many came from "foreign shops that have a hodgepodge of items."
The company has already run into accusations that it has enabled sales of shoddy or copyright-infringing products and has drawn comparisons to fast-growing Chinese shopping apps like Shein and Temu, which have flooded the market with cheap goods mailed straight from China.
TikTok's executives pushed back against such comparisons, saying it viewed itself more like Amazon or China's TMall and was using technology and manual moderation to enforce its policies, requiring "robust verification" for new sellers. The company said more than 90 percent of TikTok Shop's sellers were U.S.-based, and Mr. Le Bourgeois emphasized that a slew of major brands like Benefit, Olay, L'Oreal and e.l.f. had joined or were planning to join TikTok Shop.
Ms. Pannozzi, 37, said she was invited to join TikTok Shop a few months ago but largely ignored it until July, when she saw that her feed was flooded with QVC-style pitches and wondered if she could make money from those. She has tried to feature items from sellers with positive reviews that suit her followers -- like hair elastics and water bottles -- finding major success a few weeks ago with an advertorial video that passed more than two million views and led to over 600 sales of a Stanley-style tumbler. She said she expected to earn thousands of dollars in commissions and had joined an agency's invite-only program for TikTok Shop creators.
"Now, I'm getting a bunch of inquiries every morning when I wake up," she said. "TikTok to me now is completely different than it was a couple of months ago -- just the whole vibe of it," she added.
Paul Tran and Lynda Truong, the married founders of the South Korean skin care company Love & Pebble, attended TikTok's event with advertisers last week. They said in an interview that joining TikTok Shop this summer was "life changing," and that TikTok's offers for shoppers were generous.
Mr. Tran said the average price for the brand's core product -- a "beauty pops ice mask kit" for the face -- was about $ 39. While it was often selling for $ 7, or even $ 11, less on TikTok because of the app's discounts, he said he was still earning the same profit as he would from the standard price. Mr. Tran said he was not sure when TikTok might start taking a commission.
Ms. Levine said that TikTok could not elaborate on its future commission model but that it was "focused on getting the first of all the sellers to add their inventory to the platform."
"The name of the game is to keep people on the platform as well, whether that's through shopping, engagement of videos, whether it's through dances," Ms. Levine added. "It's always about keeping people engaged and being a part of the community."

Russia Targets Kyiv With Barrage of Drones: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The attack, which Ukraine said it had foiled, is the latest in a campaign apparently intended to destroy infrastructure and demoralize the local population.
Ukraine's military said on Sunday that it had foiled a large Russian drone attack on the capital, Kyiv, overnight, the latest barrage in a campaign intended partly to destroy military and energy infrastructure but also apparently aimed at terrorizing and demoralizing the local population.
The military said it shot down 26 of the 33 drones launched at the capital. The fate of the other seven drones was unclear. Blast waves and falling debris wounded four people and damaged dozens of houses and residential buildings, according to local military authorities. The reports have not been independently verified.
"Drones entered the capital in groups and from different directions," Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, said as he thanked the troops staffing the capital's air-defense systems, which have proved increasingly effective at downing most of the Russian drones and missiles targeting Kyiv.
Since beginning its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than 18 months ago, Russia has regularly unleashed large-scale barrages of missiles, rockets and drones on Kyiv. Last week, the region experienced one of the most significant barrages in months, with a combination of cruise missiles and drones fired at the capital. Ukrainian officials said that two people had been killed by falling debris.
Sunday's attacks followed an increasingly familiar pattern of dueling aerial assaults, in which areas of Ukraine and Russia are both targeted nearly simultaneously.
Russia's Defense Ministry said on Sunday that its army had downed a Ukrainian drone over the Bryansk region, close to the Ukrainian border. It also said that eight Ukrainian drones were shot down by air defenses over the Russian-occupied peninsula of Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014.
The Russian claims could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials did not immediately comment on the attack on the Bryansk region, as is their general custom on attacks inside Russia.
In addition to targeting Kyiv, Russia has also directed many of its drone attacks on Ukrainian grain and port facilities near the Danube River in recent months. Ukraine has used the waterway as an alternative route to export grain since Russia pulled out of an agreement that allowed Ukrainian agricultural shipments through the Black Sea.
The attacks on the Danube facilities are seen as an attempt by Russia to tighten its stranglehold on the Ukrainian economy. But they have also come perilously close to Romania, a NATO member, raising fears that a Russian drone or missile flying a short distance off course could risk dragging the Western military alliance into a direct military confrontation with Moscow.
A case in point came last week, when debris from what could be a Russian drone was found on Romania's territory across the Danube from Ukraine after an attack on a nearby Ukrainian port.
Ukrainian officials said the debris was proof that Russia's invasion posed a direct threat to NATO. Romania initially denied that a Russian drone had crashed on its territory and then, after finding the debris, issued only verbal condemnations, in an apparent attempt not to escalate the situation.
But on Saturday, new fragments of a drone "similar to those used by the Russian Army" were found, according to a statement from Romania's Defense Ministry. Constantin Spinu, a spokesman for the ministry, said "the most probable assumption" was that they came from another drone because they were found in a different location near the Danube.
Reacting to the discovery, Romania's Foreign Ministry "urgently summoned" the Russian chargé d'affaires on Saturday, according to a government statement. The Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, said in a message posted on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, that the new debris showed "a violation of our sovereign air space" and that he had discussed the matter with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general.
Mr. Stoltenberg said that there was no indication of intent to hit NATO but that the "strikes are destabilizing." He added that he welcomed a decision by the United States to deploy F-16 fighter jets to bolster air policing in the area.
Here's what else is happening in the war:
Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States' top military official, said in an interview with the BBC that Ukraine had "probably about 30 to 45 days worth of fighting weather left" before the rains come in and winter sets in, making it harder for Ukrainian troops to advance in their counteroffensive.
General Milley acknowledged that the counteroffensive had "gone slower than the planners anticipated," with Ukraine having recaptured only small patches of land in the south and the east. But he added that "the Ukrainians aren't done" and that they "are still plugging away with steady progress through the various defensive belts that the Russians have put in place."
Road to Relief, a nonprofit group that helps evacuate civilians from frontline areas in Ukraine, said that several of its foreign volunteers were killed or injured after "their vehicle came under Russian attack" on the way to Ivanivske, a town near Bakhmut, on the eastern front line. The origin of the strike could not be independently confirmed.
After it was hit, "the vehicle flipped over and lit on fire," the group said in a message posted on Instagram, adding that a Canadian volunteer was killed and two German and Swedish volunteers were badly injured with shrapnel wounds and burns. Spain's foreign minister said on Sunday that a fourth volunteer, a Spanish national, was also killed during the strike.
On the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi on Sunday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said that he was continuing to press for Russia to restore the Black Sea grain deal. Mr. Erdogan said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had tentatively accepted a proposal to distribute one million tons of grain when the two leaders met last week in Sochi.
Mr. Erdogan acknowledged that there were no signs of progress, but pledged to keep trying. "About re-implementing the grain deal, I'm not hopeless," he said. "The process can start again."

Cobb Knows Rodgers Well, and He's Got Some Insights for Jets: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Randall Cobb spent a decade catching Rodgers's passes in Green Bay. He's using that experience to teach young Jets receivers about their new quarterback's tendencies.
On the day the Jets traded for quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, Randall Cobb posted a workout video to Instagram.
Cobb, a receiver, had spent 10 of his 12 N.F.L. seasons as Rodgers's teammate and close friend with the Green Bay Packers, but was by then a free agent recovering from surgery on his right ankle to clear bone spurs. Cobb said he had preplanned to publish the video to showcase his health as teams looked to round out their rosters.
But, Cobb said, other players teased him for the timing of the post because it appeared to signal that he wanted to join Rodgers without blatantly saying so.
"It just happened to be on the same day," Cobb, smiling, said in an interview last week at his locker in the Jets' practice facility.
Cobb, 33, had been considering retirement when the Jets signed him to a one-year contract just over a week after the Rodgers trade, and after the quarterback had recruited him. Reunited in New Jersey, Cobb has been a gauge of Rodgers's moods and a messenger to Jets teammates for how to keep him happy.
That value was on display in a recent episode of "Hard Knocks," the HBO documentary series, as Cobb huddled the Jets' receivers after a poor practice and warned the group that Rodgers would not tolerate continued errors.
"If he don't trust you, he's not going to throw you the ball, I can promise you that," Cobb said. "If he don't trust you -- he do not like throwing interceptions -- so if he can't trust that you're going to run the right route, he's not going to throw it."
"How he communicates to those guys has been amazing for them in that room," said Nathaniel Hackett, the Jets' offensive coordinator. Hackett held the same position for three seasons with the Packers, where he coached Cobb and Rodgers in 2021. "I think they are only going to get better, just with him being in there and the fact that we get to have him out there playing for us is great."
There are few people who know Rodgers better on and off the field. Cobb has long been one of the quarterback's most trusted passing options, usually catching tosses out of the slot position. Rodgers was a groomsman at Cobb's wedding in 2017 and is godfather to one of his two children.
Cobb and Allen Lazard, 27, another former Packers receiver, are expected to play complementary roles in the Jets' offense, whose success will depend on the development of receiver Garrett Wilson, 23, last season's offensive rookie of the year, and Mecole Hardman, 25, a free-agent addition who spent his first four N.F.L. seasons with Kansas City. Cobb said he could act as an intermediary and help teammates adjust to their new quarterback's personality and tendencies.
"I try to be the bridge of communication," Cobb said. "We're all visual and audio learners, and just being able to see if a guy needs help, you can help them understand it in a different way."
Cobb said he has tried to preach to the receiving corps the importance of nonverbal communication before the snap, and emphasized that they should understand each component of a play instead of just their role in it. For example, on a goal line play last December, the rookie Christian Watson missed a hand signal from Rodgers, ran the wrong route and missed out on an easy touchdown reception against the Los Angeles Rams. Cobb said receivers earn Rodgers's favor by being in the right place at the right time.
"He's just very detail-oriented," Cobb said. "He does a great job of taking care of the ball, and if we're not on the same page, that can lead to two interceptions and puts us behind the eight ball and a chance to win the game."
Rodgers, though, has worked to form connections with teammates without Cobb's direct help. He said in July that he ate lunch at different tables throughout the week so as not to sit with the same players, adding that he visited different areas of practice when he was not taking reps to familiarize himself with different position groups. Wilson said Rodgers has been talkative and approachable, but he also welcomed learning from Cobb.
"I've just been trying to take everything I can from Randall," Wilson said Friday in a news conference. "He's a perfectionist when it comes to everything off the field."
Having Cobb around has also been a boon to Rodgers in other areas. Playing together in a new city, the pair, along with other teammates, have been intentional about bonding at social events. Last week, Cobb, Rodgers and tight end C.J. Uzomah attended a tennis match at the U.S. Open, and the three have gone with other teammates to Broadway shows.
Rodgers and Uzomah attended the Tony Awards in June, and the quarterback watched a Knicks playoff game with cornerback Sauce Gardner from courtside seats in May.
Cobb said the vibrancy and bustle of playing for the Jets offered a different experience than Rodgers had been exposed to during the football season. After Packers games, for instance, Cobb said he and his family would normally order pizza because most other restaurants were closed. Not so in the New York metropolitan area.
"It's not like the N.F.L. life that you imagine in your mind," Cobb said of living in Green Bay, Wis. "I think that he's able to live and enjoy life with a different perspective that he hasn't had in his career yet."

Full text: The writer and actress visits Coney Island as the New York leg of "Death, Let Me Do My Show" arrives Off Broadway.
"My grandfather went on this one time," Rachel Bloom effused on a recent afternoon. "He thought he was going to die."
A writer-performer best known for the cult musical comedy "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," Bloom was standing at the base of Coney Island's Cyclone, the 96-year-old wooden thrill ride designated as a landmark by American Coaster Enthusiasts. She was in town to begin technical rehearsals for the New York leg of "Death, Let Me Do My Show," a mostly one-woman comedy about existential dread at the Lucille Lortel Theater.
That dread is familiar to her. And personal. She first experienced it as a school-age child, after emerging from Disneyland's Haunted Mansion attraction. "I just had this thought of, we're all going to die someday," she said. "And I couldn't shake that."
She has since learned coping mechanisms -- how to stop the thoughts before they start or, if that fails, to do something that returns her to her body. Something like riding the world's second-steepest wooden roller coaster, which boasts 60-mile-per-hour speeds and an 85-foot drop. Bloom -- brisk, animated, with a mind that sometimes outraces her mouth -- apparently finds a 3.75 G-force relaxing.
"When my brain is spinning about something that I cannot solve, the only way to actually fix it is to not think about it and not engage and to be present and in my body," she said. "What's the encapsulation of that? It's being on a roller coaster."
As with existential dread, Bloom came to coasters young. Having grown up in Los Angeles, within driving distance of the Disneyland, Six Flags, Knott's Berry Farm trifecta, her favorites include the GhostRider, the Incredicoaster, the Riddler's Revenge. Though she graduated from New York University, she had never ridden the Cyclone.
Bloom had arrived on the boardwalk frazzled from subway hassles. She wore dark pants, a printed shirt over a lacy bra, a baseball cap bought at Mel Brooks's Vegas show, hoop earrings, Ray-Bans. A young man had hit on her on the train ride over and she had pretended to be a graphic designer named Jessica, then given him a fake Instagram handle. To prepare for the ride, she primed herself with a Nathan's hot dog (a person should never coaster on an empty stomach), an application of sunscreen to her décolletage and a warm-up cruise on a kiddie coaster, the Sea Serpent. (This was the most intense coaster I could handle, and Bloom now owns a picture of me surrounded by children and looking absolutely terrified.) Then it was time to approach the Cyclone.
Her director, Seth Barrish, a solo show veteran, had warned against it, revealing that the last time he had ridden the Cyclone, he had popped a rib. But Bloom was undaunted.
"I trust it," she said, as she approached the ticket booth. She was going to think about drops, thrills, camelback humps. Not injury. Not death.
For what it's worth, Bloom didn't set out to write a show about the fear of death. She began work on it in 2019, just as "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" was ending. (Owing to the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, she could neither discuss that CW comedy nor her short-lived showbiz series "Reboot.") At first, the stage show was resolutely silly. Its big number concerned a tree with blossoms that smelled like ejaculate. She became pregnant that year and planned to film the show a few months after her due date, then release it as a special.
But the world and the novel coronavirus had other ideas. She gave birth in late March, just as she learned that her songwriting partner, Adam Schlesinger, had been admitted to the hospital and was on a ventilator. Her daughter needed a week in the NICU and some time on a ventilator, too. And then, just as her daughter was discharged, Bloom was told that Schlesinger had died from complications of the coronavirus.
She'd been thinking about death already. (Pregnancy and maternal mortality rate statistics have a way of forcing that.) After Schlesinger died, those thoughts worsened. "It was awful," she said. "It was just too profound."
Months later, in the home office that has since become her daughter's playroom, she looked up at the run order for the show. There was the song about the tree, a bit about pregnancy tests. "This is all moot," she remembered thinking. "The world is falling apart, my friend's dead. What is this? It just seems so absurd." She began to ask herself if a world that felt fundamentally terrible could still support the raunchy, the frivolous. Could she still sing about ejaculate now?
As she put it, "What is the place of laughter and silliness when you've stared into an abyss?"
About a year after that, she felt ready to offer an answer: Onstage, with the abyss as co-star. As she kept working on the show, most of the material that didn't concern life and death fell away. (Somehow, the tree remained.) The show that emerged and which she has since performed in a half-dozen cities still begins breezily. "Who's ready to just have fun and pretend it's 2019?" Bloom announces in the opening moments. Not Bloom. The transformed show becomes a way -- in song, video and bits about vaginal bleeding -- to work through dread and despair.
"I think it is very important to not ignore death," she said. "And to acknowledge that it's coming for us, but to not let it overwhelm us." (In this, the show dovetails with the last sections of her recent essay collection, "I Want to Be Where the Normal People Are.")
The show isn't bleak. Or even especially raw. Bloom is a practiced comedian. Barrish is an experienced director. While she admits to having a "a lower level of embarrassment or shame" than most people, she doesn't include anything that she hasn't already worked through. "Anything that I'm not ready to stand behind 100 percent or any emotion that isn't processed," she said. The character she plays in the show is a Rachel Bloom that hasn't yet dealt with birth and loss. But she gets there. And the show ends with a revelation that she actually had, in the ocean, on vacation, about her daughter and her dog and an acceptance of her own mortality.
"It's almost like when I start the show I'm pretending to be myself years ago, and then by the end of the show, I'm caught up," she said.
This mental equilibrium suggests that a ride on the Cyclone wasn't absolutely necessary. But a lack of immediate anguish wouldn't stop her. After buying a ticket she strode through the gate and then into a seat toward the back of the train, the lap belt tight. Then with a jerk and the sound of juddering metal she was off, hair gleaming in the sun, one arm up to wave as she hurtled down the drops.
Two minutes later she returned to the street, breathless and elated, enthusing about the speed, the dips, even the bumps. Worry, if she'd had any to begin with, had been banished.
"That was great!" she said. "That was wild. It was like the subway turned into a roller coaster."

A Chef's Full Day Is Wrapped Around a Nap: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Pierre Serrao, co-founder of the Bronx culinary collective Ghetto Gastro, catches up with friends over a homemade feast.
As one-third of the Bronx culinary collective Ghetto Gastro, Pierre Serrao naturally spends his Sundays in the kitchen.
Ghetto Gastro, which formed in 2012 and consists of Mr. Serrao, Jon Gray and Lester Walker, creates recipes that combine "the cooking traditions of Black, brown and Asian folks in a high-quality, healthy fashion."
Earlier in the pandemic, Ghetto Gastro teamed up with the nonprofit organization Rethink Food and a local restaurant, La Morada, to help feed thousands of people in the Bronx. "They stayed open when everybody else was closed," Mr. Serrao said. Ghetto Gastro raised money and secured supplies, like sneakers, for the workers. "Their sneakers were all the way worn out from running up like 30 flights of stairs every day to bring people food," he said.
Recently, Mr. Serrao has been focused on promoting Ghetto Gastro's first cookbook, "Ghetto Gastro Presents Black Power Kitchen," which was released last fall, and the collective's newest line of affordable cookware for Target. He and his co-founders also started a podcast where they discuss the foods that are essential to New York City culture, from chopped cheese to American Chinese food.
Ghetto Gastro is also opening a new lab, or "idea kitchen" -- a space to prepare ingredients, test new recipes and host dinners. "The space itself will have a full production kitchen and a private dining situation, but then also we'll have a studio space for us to shoot content," Mr. Serrao said.
Mr. Serrao, 35, lives in Harlem with his partner, Devon Scarpulla, 32, their 3-year-old daughter, Saige, and their son, Santi, who was born last month.
MEDITATIVE MORNINGS I usually wake up around 5:30 a.m.My meditation in the morning, sometimes it's guided meditations, and other times I just find moments to take silence, manifest things and also reflect on moments that have happened and things that I want to happen in the future.
WELL BALANCED We'll go to Daily Provisions on the Upper West Side and grab some breakfast, a little something to kick-start the day. I'll have the cheesy egg gougères, a little avocado toast and a matcha.
FARMER'S MARKET RUN Then we'll go to the 79th Street Greenmarket. We grab some radishes, carrots, bread and greens. From there, we come back to my house, drop off the goods and go to Central Park with Saige.
OWL SPOTTING We walk around the park and up the little paths by the waterfalls, and see the owl, the famous owl that's up there: Flaco, that's his name.
FULL-BODY PUMP I come back from the park and then I go to my gym, which is at a friend's studio. It's in the South Bronx, right around the neighborhood where Ghetto Gastro's old labs used to be. I do a quick full-body pump, just to give the people something seductive on this Sunday. I do some bench press, squats, pull-ups, situps, jump rope. Then I do a little boxing. I'll have a smoothie -- peanut butter and banana with sea moss, a little bit of cinnamon and some maca. Then, I get my hair braided by a friend of mine named Lisa.
TARGET TRIP I'm strictly going to Target for Ghetto Gastro products. The air fryer and the waffle maker do the most work in my house. That's the only reason I'm going to Target right now -- and some paper towels to clean up some messes. And some diapers and some wipes. You know how you go into Target just for one thing and you end up walking out with everything.
AFTERNOON SNOOZE On a good nap day, I try to do an hour and a half. Honestly, it depends on how long my daughter naps for. Some days you can get a nap in, other days not. Truly anywhere: like on my couch, in the bed, in my car, wherever I can catch some Zs.
GHETTO GASTRO FEAST We have dinner; a couple of friends of mine come over. I make some stuff out of the "Black Power Kitchen" book. I do a little cornbread and plantain and pistachio curry with root vegetables. In our book it's called Digging in the Curry ("D.I.T.C."), but I just call it the plantain and pistachio curry, because those are the ingredients that I use that are a little "exotic." I do the beet carpaccio with fried plantains, hazelnuts and raspberry powder -- raspberry and yuzu. I do carrot suya with a cashew butter and a carrot-top oil. I do some coconut rice. Definitely have a salad, some fresh greens always -- with the dressing out of the book, probably. Then for dessert, we had a hibiscus sorbet and a kumquat sorbet, just to cleanse the palates.
WIND DOWN Sage takes a bath and relaxes on the couch with my wifey, Devon. We're watching "Minx." It's cool, instead of being just naked women walking around all the time, to have guys put out there. You also kind of have an insight into what the times were like back then, when women were fighting for their rights and for their voices to be heard, and "down with the patriarchy" and "the matriarchy awakens" and all that. We've been enjoying that series. I'm asleep by 11 p.m.-ish.

Offscreen, They Got Their Perfect Ending: [Society Desk]

Full text: When KJ Smith and Skyh Black first met on the set of the TV show "Sistas," Covid precautions kept them apart. After exchanging numbers months later, their story extended beyond the screen.
In July 2020, KJ Smith, an actress and producer, was excited to get back to Atlanta. Ms. Smith plays Andrea Barnes, one of the lead characters on Tyler Perry's BET comedy-drama, "Sistas," which had pushed back shooting because of the pandemic. The cast and crew were filming new episodes, and Ms. Smith had decided to vlog her experience returning to a television set in the midst of Covid.
While waiting for a flight filled with her co-workers to take off from Los Angeles to Atlanta, Ms. Smith figured she'd start her vlog by asking some of her castmates to introduce themselves to the camera.
"I turn on my camera, and the first person I see -- and maybe because that's the person who I wanted to see -- was mister tall, dark and handsome, Skyh Black," Ms. Smith, 38, said.
She asked Mr. Black to tell the camera about himself, and he explained that he was joining the cast as Jacobi, a recurring character, who would appear in 17 episodes.
"I was shocked by the sound of his voice, I wasn't mentally prepared for it to be so deep," Ms. Smith said. "It just made a really incredible first impression, because he wasn't putting on airs and I could tell."
Mr. Black was also intrigued by his first meeting with Ms. Smith, but because of Covid precautions that the cast and crew were taking, they didn't spend much time together. They both returned to Los Angeles, and in November 2020 Mr. Black booked a leading role on "All the Queen's Men," another BET series. When Ms. Smith saw the news in January 2021, she messaged Mr. Black on Instagram to congratulate him. They exchanged numbers, and talked on the phone for five hours over the next two days, covering everything from their careers to their fathers, both of whom had died.
"We talked about so much," Mr. Black, 35, said. "The conversation was effortless."
They met up a few days later at Zuma Beach, in Malibu, Calif., where they had a picnic. Mr. Black was trying to impress Ms. Smith, and brought her flowers. Ms. Smith, however, showed up in sneakers and her hair in two pigtails, thinking it was just a casual meet up to talk about acting.
"If I would have known it was a date, I definitely would have dressed differently," she said, with a laugh. "He really knocked me off my feet right away with the effort and the intention, because I had frankly never been treated that way."
On their second date, they had food delivered to Ms. Smith's house in Los Angeles, where Mr. Black worked up the courage to ask her to sign a "general, all encompassing" nondisclosure agreement. She agreed, and Mr. Black also signed hers. After signing them, they felt they could be completely open with each other.
"It sounds transactional, but it was the safest thing we ever did," Mr. Black said. "That was the beginning of where we are now. I'll never forget that."

When they returned to Atlanta to film in February 2021, they tried to keep their relationship a secret -- there was a no fraternization policy on set. In spring 2021, they told Tyler Perry, who is a writer, director and executive producer on "Sistas," and an executive producer on "All the Queen's Men," about their relationship, and by summer 2021 started to be more open about dating.
"I think the two of them were made for each other," said Mr. Perry through his publicist.
For Mr. Black's birthday in February 2021, Ms. Smith surprised him with an alto saxophone -- the same type that his grandfather had bought for him when he was young, which he had pawned to move to Los Angeles to pursue acting.
"I met the love of my life, so I want to do everything with him," Ms. Smith said. "Even if I've gone swimming a million times, I want to go swimming with him."
On Christmas Day 2021, Mr. Black proposed in front of both of their families in Miami, where they were staying in a rented home. Ms. Smith was wearing a different ring on her engagement finger, and was so excited she flung it onto a nearby table.
"People still roast me to this day because of it," she said.
A few months later the couple moved in together in Los Angeles, where they currently live.
"She's just so easy to love," Mr. Black said about Ms. Smith. "Her communication and her want to grow is what I love the most about her."
The couple were married Sept. 3 at the Malibu Dream Resort, a venue near the beach where they had their first date. Aventer Gray, a friend of the bride and a co-pastor at Relentless Church in Greenville, S.C., officiated in front of about 150 guests.
"He's inspiring, encouraging and the most talented man I've ever met," said Ms. Smith, who plans to take her husband's last name. "He's single-handedly changed my life."

Full text: For the last 10 years, Michael Kors has raised money to pay for meals in developing regions.
About a decade ago, the actress Halle Berry visited Jinotega, a region in Nicaragua. In video from the visit, Ms. Berry looked on as tidy rows of children filed into their village school, where they would be provided their single balanced meal of the day. The prospect of a hearty lunch encouraged their parents to send them to school, Ms. Berry said in the footage, even those parents who may have been reluctant.
She was acting as an emissary for Watch Hunger Stop, an initiative organized by the designer Michael Kors in partnership with the United Nations World Food Program, to provide meals to schools in developing regions around the world.
Kate Hudson joined the initiative in 2015 and made a field visit to Cambodia in 2017. She and Ms. Berry have since appeared in online campaign imagery, on television, and in promotional videos for the program, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this month.
"At the start, I wasn't sure we would engage everyone," Mr. Kors said in recent a phone conversation. "We thought that people would get bored." But the campaign has prospered through sustained social media messaging and the sale of W.H.S. special-edition apparel and accessories. Donations are solicited in stores and through a link on the Michael Kors website.
"A lot of people think that philanthropy is only for the rich," Mr. Kors said. He has challenged that assumption, arguing that donations are well within the means of many of his followers. Citing a W.F.P. figure, he stressed that $ 5, the price of a coffee in many large cities, could feed a child in school for a month.
Such messaging, most successful on the Michael Kors Instagram account, has been effective. Since 2013, Watch Hunger Stop has raised about $ 7.5 million, the equivalent of more than 30 million school meals (at about 25 cents per meal). The Michael Kors brand expects to donate an additional three million meals throughout the next campaign year, beginning in October, according to a spokeswoman.
Mr. Kors said that for girls there is a particular benefit. The prospect of a free meal encouraged parents who would likely have kept their daughters doing chores at home, to send them to school. That decision, he said, could have an enormous impact on the trajectory of these girls' lives.
Mr. Kors's eyes were opened to the impact of social activism in mid-1980s, at the height of the AIDS crisis. "We were assaulted every which way," he said. He was aware of God's Love We Deliver, a meal-delivery service that began around that time, he said. "Still, everyone we knew was ill and we all felt helpless,"
Watch Hunger Stop was small at the outset, but contributions were significant in ways not always tangible. For the program's beneficiaries, "the knowledge that someone was actually thinking about you, cared about you, made a difference," Mr. Kors said.
Certainly Michael Kors is not the first fashion brand to embrace the power of positive P.R. Ralph Lauren, Asos, H&M and Tiffany & Company, among others, have stepped up their support of philanthropic initiatives in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar endeavors among fashion brands and retailers date back at least to the early 2000s. The prevailing wisdom, as noted at the time in the Harvard Business Review, is that "philanthropy is used as a form of public relations or advertising, promoting a company's image or brand through cause-related marketing or other high-profile sponsorships."
That reasoning stands today. So it is no great leap to suppose that Michael Kors and its parent company, Capri Holdings, acquired last month for $ 8.5 billion by Tapestry, the owner of Coach and Kate Spade, is likely to benefit from its intensified social cause marketing.
Watch Hunger Stop may or may not boost brand recognition worldwide. "But it absolutely allows people to know the values of the brand they are aligning with," Mr. Kors said.
He has amplified his promotional efforts. Images of Ms. Berry and Ms. Hudson are featured on special-edition watches. A line of T-shirts and totes designed in collaboration with Sang Bleu, a Swiss creative agency, will also be sold online and at some Michael Kors stores beginning on Oct. 1. All profits from the T-shirts and totes will be funneled to Watch Hunger Stop, and $ 50 will be donated for each watch sold.
On Sept. 11, 2023, the day of the Michael Kors spring-summer 2024 fashion show, Mr. Kors and Cindy McCain, the executive director of Watch Hunger Stop, will host a cocktail reception celebrating the 10th anniversary, at the United Nations headquarters. Ms. Berry will be there as well, and the Kors company plans to donate 100 meals to the W.F.P. for each guest.
"Obviously September 11 resonates heavily with me and so many of us," Mr. Kors said. "But for me, celebrating on that day is a show of positivity."

Osaka Discusses Mental Health and Her Plans to Return: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Osaka, the four-time Grand Slam singles champion, has taken breaks from tennis for her mental health and to start a family, but she is aiming to compete again in 2024.
Naomi Osaka didn't bring any rackets with her when she arrived at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Wednesday afternoon. Osaka had no plans to play tennis.
"For me, coming back here, it means a lot," Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam singles champion, said. "It's like seeing an old friend that you haven't seen in a long time."
Osaka was speaking in the main news conference room on Wednesday inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. She knows it well. It's where she got to field questions from reporters on some of her best occasions, like her U.S. Open championships in 2018 and 2020. It's also where she has been during low moments, including a first-round exit at last year's tournament.
"There were some tears shed," Osaka said about the room. "A lot."
On Wednesday, Osaka had returned for a panel with Michael Phelps, the American swimmer who stands as the most decorated Olympian ever; Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general; and Dr. Brian Hainline, the chief medical officer of the N.C.A.A. and the chairman of the United States Tennis Association board.
The topic of the panel, mental health and sports, is one that Osaka has spoken about often since she cited mental health concerns in her withdrawal from the French Open in 2021. Her exit then led to a break from tennis.
Osaka, who turned pro in 2013 as a teenager and came to be seen as the heir apparent to Serena Williams, is away from tennis now, too. In January she announced she was pregnant but planned to play in the 2024 Australian Open. She gave birth to her daughter in July, calling it on Instagram "a cool little intermission."
On Wednesday, Osaka, 25, said she had plenty of time to reflect during her most recent leave from the sport.
"It definitely made me appreciate a lot of things that I took for granted," she said.
Osaka did not say when she planned to return to tennis during the panel, but she later told ESPN in an interview that she had designs on playing in 2024, adding that she has been training and should be hitting balls soon.
Speaking back in that room, Osaka alluded to the idea of having a long career.
"I just remember watching the Australian Open and being very devastated because I've never missed an Australian Open," Osaka said. But while watching, Osaka said, she thought about how late Serena and Venus Williams played into their careers.
Serena Williams, who retired at last year's U.S. Open, played until she was 40. Venus Williams, 43, played at this year's tournament, losing in the first round of singles.
"I was thinking I probably no way will ever play at their age," Osaka said. "But sitting here, I'm like, you know what? I might do that."
Osaka said pregnancy gave her a lot of time to think, and that she felt isolated at times. She had to force herself to ask for help.
"I actually felt lonely during my pregnancy just because I felt like I wasn't able to do a lot of things," she said.
She added: "Normally I'm thinking, 'If I'm going to be an independent woman, then I'm not going to ask anyone for help. Whenever something happens, just take it on the chin.' But then I got to a place where I needed to ask for help."
For decades, many athletes have been reluctant to share their struggles with their mental health. It's especially the case for professionals, whose jobs require them to push their bodies to perform at the highest level. But in recent years, athletes have gradually become more open about discussing mental health. Besides Osaka, they include the gymnast Simone Biles, the basketball star Kevin Love, and, in tennis, Amanda Anisimova, the young American once ranked in the top 25 who in May cited mental health concerns in deciding to step away from the sport.
Among Olympians, Phelps has also led a push to speak out on mental health.
Phelps, who has also faced mental health issues, said that, like for Osaka, working through those problems required realizing he had to reach out and ask for help.
"I learned that I couldn't do it all by myself," Phelps said.
After winning six gold medals at the 2004 Athens Games, Phelps entered what he described as a "post-Olympics depression." But instead of reaching out to someone for help, Phelps said, he compartmentalized his issues by swimming and training more.
It wasn't until about 2014, Phelps said, when he hit a "breaking point."
"I decided that something had to change," he said. "So for me, I had to become vulnerable for the first time in my life.
While Osaka didn't say exactly when she'll play again, when she returns the difficulties of life on tour will follow, such as time away from family and the pressure of competing in an individualistic sport. But this time, Osaka said she will be more comfortable seeking help when she needs it.
Osaka said that she had two friends she counts on when she is dealing with loneliness.
"I know I can reach out to them at any time, and I think it's really important," she said. "You're not alone in anything."
Naomi Osaka said that her most recent break from tennis "definitely made me appreciate a lot of things that I took for granted." (PHOTOGRAPH BY HIROKO MASUIKE/THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B8.

One Karaoke Kid Rock, and a Surplus of Sheryl Crows: [Society Desk]

Full text: Vipin Chamakkala and Amanda Robson, who both work in venture capital, met two years ago while working temporarily in New York.
When Vipin Mathew Chamakkala first spotted Amanda Elizabeth Robson at his previous company's karaoke outing in Manhattan's Koreatown in May 2021, he wondered what an interloper was doing there.
Ms. Robson, who goes by Robby, had been at a business lunch with his colleagues earlier that day. When they mentioned the karaoke event, she thought it sounded fun and invited herself.
At first sight of Mr. Chamakkala that evening, she was intrigued. Her interest was further piqued when he duetted with a male colleague to Kid Rock's "Picture" featuring Sheryl Crow; they took turns singing both parts.
"He was not friendly at first," she said. But once they started chatting and had a few beers, she felt at ease with him. They later decided to walk to Chinatown for a bite, but the restaurant was already closed, so they settled on pizza.
He then walked her to her rental apartment in TriBeCa, where he kissed her good night.
Both had been working temporarily for different companies in New York, but lived in San Francisco -- she in the Pacific Heights neighborhood, he in the Mission district.
Though Ms. Robson worried when Mr. Chamakkala didn't ask for her phone number, she needn't have; he sent her a direct message on Instagram soon after.
Their first official date followed in July after they returned to San Francisco. Since Mr. Chamakkala was relatively new to the Bay Area, they did a GoCar tour, requiring them to sit close to one another in the small, three-wheel vehicle. Drinks and her favorite dessert, Key lime pie, followed at the Blue Mermaid restaurant at the Argonaut Hotel.
By their third date -- seeing Zedd, a D.J., at 1015 Folsom, a San Francisco nightclub, that August -- both knew they were falling in love.
"I remember thinking to myself, 'Relax, you're still getting to know each other,' but I couldn't help how I felt," Ms. Robson would later say in her vows.

In September, Ms. Robson's job called her back to New York for a week and a half. "I felt my life without Robby kinda sucks," Mr. Chamakkala said.
Ms. Robson, 31, is a partner in Cowboy Ventures, a women-led venture capital firm based in Palo Alto, Calif. She is also the founder of Modern Angels, a community of female and nonbinary angel investors. She grew up in Hamilton, Ontario, and is a graduate of Ivey Business School at the Western University in London, Ontario.
Mr. Chamakkala, 35, who grew up in Selden, N.Y., is the son of immigrants from Kerala, India. He is a senior director for customer partnerships at Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm based in Menlo Park, Calif. He graduated from Fordham University. Both Mr. Chamakkala and Ms. Robson were on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in venture capital: he in 2018, she in 2021.
By March 2022, they moved in together in the NoPa neighborhood of San Francisco, where they still live.
In October 2022, so unsuspecting of Mr. Chamakkala's beach outing was Ms. Robson that when they reached a blanket with champagne on Marshall's Beach in San Francisco, she assumed it was for someone else. Mr. Chamakkala got down on one knee to propose -- and drew a complete blank. "My boss told me to think about what I was going to say and be sure it's meaningful," he said. "I had this whole thing I wanted to say, and I maybe said three lines of it."
Afterward, family, friends and colleagues surprised her at their apartment.
The two were married on Aug. 19 in front of 181 guests by Sean O'Connor, a close friend and Universal Life Church minister, at the Triple S Ranch in Napa, Calif.
As part of the wedding ceremony, Mr. O'Connor read seven core values that the couple consider the bedrock of their partnership. They included: "their devotion to uplifting the communities around them; their belief in true equality and fairness and cherishing diversity in all of its forms as a source of strength and beauty; and their deep respect for each other's origins, honoring the experiences and places that have shaped them."
The couple had kicked off their wedding weekend the day before with an Indian welcome dinner, with karaoke. They sang "Picture" -- this time with Mr. Chamakkala doing Kid Rock's part and Ms. Robson doing Sheryl Crow's.

A Content Creator Extends Her Good Fortune: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After her parents passed along their rent-stabilized apartment on the Upper West Side, Hattie Kolp used it to start a new career as a content creator in the home décor space.
Like many college graduates, Hattie Kolp needed two major things: a job and somewhere to live.
Born and raised in New York, Ms. Kolp always knew she'd be back. California living, she decided after four years attending college outside Los Angeles, wasn't for her. Her West, she realized, would always be the Upper West Side, where she had lived in the same apartment since she was 10 years old and where the ballet, the opera, art exhibits and Broadway shows were just a few blocks, a train or a cab ride away. Central Park, she likes to say, "was basically my backyard."
She wanted that spirit again. So with no money and no job, she did what any other 20-something would do: She moved back in with her parents.
She had many fond childhood memories of the two-bedroom, prewar rental. Her parents -- her father worked at a nonprofit and her mother as an art historian and, later, a nursery school teacher -- "loved to throw a good party," she said. Returning to the "bustling, cramped apartment" was easy.
That was 2014. And Ms. Kolp is still there.
Why? That's the stuff of New York urban legend -- the kind that makes New Yorkers swoon or loathe, the kind that has gained Ms. Kolp some moderate fame, 241,000 followers on TikTok and 230,000 on Instagram.
Her parents' apartment was rent-stabilized, and when they retired and decamped to Virginia in 2018, they passed the apartment to her.
Ms. Kolp now makes a living as a content creator. Followers are drawn by the dream of living so cheaply in an apartment that Ms. Kolp knows is roomy for one person, but her following has grown as she has explored the intersection of interior design and content creation.
$ 1,300 (Plus small annual increases.) | Upper West Side
Hattie Kolp, 31
Occupation: Ms. Kolp is a full-time content creator in the home décor space.
On keeping the apartment in the family: While Ms. Kolp doesn't have children, she says she intends to hold on to the rent-stabilized apartment for future generations. "I definitely will always keep the apartment, for sure. And if I have children who would like to keep it as well, then, absolutely. I would love that."
On living on the Upper West Side as an adult: "I've never been interested in many of the things that people want to come to New York for. That whole hustle and bustle culture just does not appeal to me. I wanna be as far away from all of that as possible. I don't wanna be in any trendy areas, I don't wanna go to a trendy restaurant. I just wanna live my life, so I love that the Upper West Side just is quiet and quaint, and it feels neighborhood-y."
Content creation is now her job, but it took her a while to get to that place.
After graduating from college, Ms. Kolp took a job showing apartments for a real estate agency, a notoriously brutal and oft-unstable profession in a city like New York. She estimates that she made just $ 1,000 during the stint. "I never ever had any adult experiences with New York City real estate before, so I just had no concept," she said in an interview.
She did that for two months and then became a teacher -- her degree was in child development -- another job that barely paid the bills in New York. Even going back to school at Hunter College to get a graduate degree didn't shake the feeling that she should be doing something different.
While she was unsure about her career, she was certain that she had figured out her living situation, telling herself she "would be insane to not take over the lease," as her parents prepared to move from the rent-stabilized unit. In New York City, rent stabilization applies generally to apartments in buildings with at least six units that were built before 1974 or newer buildings that receive tax breaks. A nine-member board approves the percentages by which landlords can legally increase rents for such apartments.
The apartment is approximately 1,200 square feet, and remains in the low four figures in a neighborhood where the average monthly rent tops $ 4,500.
When her parents left, she began making it her own. She abandoned their "boho" theme, she said, and took her inspiration from the Upper West Side's European-style architecture. The apartment is now more akin to a flat in Paris. "I think I really let the architecture of the neighborhood and the bones of my apartment -- really, just, its aesthetic -- steer my design choices."
She began to write on a blog about her experience, sharing her changes to the apartment in real time. While many Americans hunkered down in their apartments with sourdough starters, copies of "Animal Crossing" and far too much booze, Ms. Kolp was knocking down walls.
People were watching, and then more people were watching. It seemed the whole world knew she paid only $ 1,300 in rent, so much so that she prefers to focus on her interior design of the apartment.
Instead, she focused on the apartment's evolution: The pink walls that colored her childhood bedroom are gone. Initially converted to a guest room for her parents and friends coming into town, today it's her own personal library. Bookshelves are filled with knickknacks and books from her childhood. The butler's pantry (Who can say they have one of those?) was painted in a dark green shade to convey a "very moody space" that resembles the entryway of a speakeasy.
She used sticky tiles to make a backsplash in her kitchen. A quick glance up, and you'll see her sticky, copper-colored papered ceiling. She has also restored a fireplace, uncovered pocket doors, installed crown molding and replaced doorknobs, making changes, she said, that put the apartment back in its "intended condition."
In between the D.I.Y. projects, she quit her job as a teacher, becoming a full-time content creator last year. Fans (and haters) follow her apartment updates religiously.
While divulging the intimate details of the place where you sleep, socialize, and cry to the world might seem invasive, Ms. Kolp said doing so has helped her find a global community.
"Opening up my life on social media and sharing what I love with the world," Ms. Kolp said, "it's led me to have so many amazing friendships and connections that I otherwise would never have made."

Full text: Experts suggest a few recent products that may stick around for generations to come.
This article is part of our Design special section about new interpretations of antique design styles.
What makes a design a classic? New products flood the market every year, yet very few have long lives and lasting impact. The lounge chair designed by Charles and Ray Eames is as coveted today as it was in 1956, the year it was introduced. (Probably even more so.) Richard Sapper's Tizio table lamp has illuminated the work spaces of thousands of users who were born after it made its first appearance in 1971. Both products are enshrined in museums.
"A classic is something beautiful that can be acknowledged by everyone," said Maria Cristina Didero, a Milan-based design curator and author. "But what is classic design to experts may be different from what people see who just want to furnish a home with beautiful objects."
Ms. Didero assigned to the first category Bruno Munari's Chair for Very Brief Visits, a piece designed in 1945 that has a sloped seat that is uncomfortable to perch on and is therefore more of a philosophical meditation about furniture than anything you would offer to a guest.
And definitions of classics change over time, she said. A coat rack produced by the Italian company Gufram, in 1972, in the shape of a cactus earned its stature because it rebelled against conventional tastes. Today, it is celebrated as a cheerful piece of Pop Art.
In whatever way consensus is reached, there is little argument about the works that furnish the pantheon of golden oldies. But what about recently produced designs? Which will be classics down the road?
Ms. Didero nominated the Bilboquet lamp by the British Canadian designer Philippe Malouin, a flexible table light assembled with magnets that was previewed at the 2023 Milan Furniture Fair and will be available next year from Flos. "It's a good combination of present sensibilities and past masterpieces," she said, finding echoes of the Italian master Vico Magistretti's 1965 Eclisse lamp.
She also gave a shout out to Candy Cubes (2014), chunky, geometric tables by the Netherlands-based designer Sabine Marcelis. "I like Sabine's work as it is refined and pure, and her interpretations of colors and finishes are unique," she said.
"It's difficult to say what will be classics in the future," said Giulio Cappellini, a designer and art director who helped launch the careers of Jasper Morrison, Tom Dixon, Marcel Wanders and many other contemporary design stars. "In the '60s, '70s and '80s, there were really classics and high concepts, but in the last few years there are many nice products but it's hard to find strong products."
An exception is the British architect Norman Foster's minimal Ixa light from Artemide (2022), which Mr. Cappellini finds "quite interesting; it could be the new Tizio." He also singled out Mr. Wanders's recent Skynest pendant light with woven LED strips from Flos as "a very contemporary interpretation of an old chandelier. It's something new in technology, and it's also a beautiful image."
But his No. 1 pick was the Alfi chair designed by Mr. Morrison for the American furniture company Emeco (2015), which consists of fully recycled materials, including polypropylene mixed with wood fiber, and is already in the permanent collection of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. "Alfi is an honest product, simple and timeless," he said.
(Alfi was also the choice of the design entrepreneur and author Murray Moss, who said, "I'm almost surprised that I didn't see it coming. It's so correct in so many ways.")
Kathryn Hiesinger, a senior decorative arts curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, laid down her criteria for classics in simple terms: "I prize originality and quality," she said. "Trained as an art historian, I think in terms of historical, cultural and technological significance as well as aesthetic achievement."
Ms. Hiesinger said she would select almost any of Naoto Fukasawa's products for Muji. (The museum is planning a Fukasawa show for 2024, Ms. Hiesinger said.) The Japanese designer's appliances -- and his toaster above all else -- are ordinary objects that have been transformed into collectible art with "a clean-lined simplicity of form, surface and meticulous functionality that make them both anonymous and universal," she said. "Perhaps they are the best expression of Bauhaus functionalism."
Her colleagues Colin Fanning and Alisa Chiles, assistant curators in the museum's European decorative arts and sculpture department, voted for the Danish design firm GamFratesi's midcentury-inspired Beetle chair (2013), the remote-controllable Stagg EKG electric kettle by the San Francisco company Fellow and a steel outdoor furniture collection called Palissade, by the French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec.
At least one expert prized environmental factors above all others when considering designs that deserved to last. "There are a lot of beautiful things, but what will make a real difference?" asked Aric Chen, the director of Het Nieuwe Instituut, a museum of architecture, design and digital culture in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. "It is not necessarily about objects, but the way we produce objects -- rethinking life cycles."
Mr. Chen proposed Sunne, a solar-powered aluminum window lamp by Marjan van Aubel that first appeared as a Kickstarter campaign in 2021.
"What will become classics of our time will be a mix of craft-forward objects, as well as products that may not appeal to the masses but have cult followings," said Asli Altay, the head of communications and content at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. She specified handmade wood dolls that transmit music, designed by Teenage Engineering, a group of young Swedes. She also praised the construction of the Nigerian designer Nifemi Marcus-Bello's M2 shelf made of African mahogany and powder-coated steel.
"To me, a classic has three qualities," said Bobbye Tigerman, the curator of decorative arts and design at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "It reflects the time in which it was made, it demonstrates outstanding craftsmanship and it has a timeless visual appeal. Her pick: the Nyala chair by Jomo Tariku, which signals the designer's Ethiopian heritage and his concern for antelope native to the Bale Mountains in that country. Nyala's organic curves "give it a timeless visual allure," she said.
Gus Casely-Hayford, the director of the V&A East Museum, which is scheduled to open in his home base, London, in 2024, saw practicality as the foundation for future recognition. "I live in a city with nine million people and over three million cars," he said. "It's impossible to get around. You start to think about having a bike, but so often people find them stolen."
Which is why he nominated the Brompton electric bicycle, first introduced in 2017. "Small and compact, it folds down to the size of a piece of luggage that you might take with you on a plane, but it can be ridden by anyone of any size," he said. "Bikes were originally designed in the 1880s. This is a foldable, electric, timeless invention that feels incredibly timely."
Marc Benda, the co-founder of Friedman Benda in Manhattan, which deals in limited-edition designs, pleaded guilty to self-interest when he singled out the Trauma Chair (2020) by Samuel Ross, a British industrial and fashion designer his gallery represents. "The chair, which has already entered the collections of two museums, is really a reaction to the events of three years ago," Mr. Benda said, referring to the protests after the killing of George Floyd by a police officer. "It's a Black voice addressing issues of social justice."
Though his gallery objects are not widely available, Mr. Benda said, they should still qualify for admission into the canon of classics. "They can be seen and appreciated in museums and on Instagram," he said. "It's not only about acquiring."

In the Hamptons, Potter's Wheels by the Pool: [Style Desk]

Full text: Hamptonites can't get enough of pottery wheels in their backyards. One ceramist is bringing the messy, yet soothing, hobby into the homes of the moneyed elite.
When Chelsea Hirschhorn organized a summer gathering in July at her house in Amagansett, N.Y., she made sure to include one party trick: pottery wheels. She hosted 15 adults for a ceramics class, where they sipped cocktails while spinning the wheels on her deck, shaping cups and bowls out of clay, followed by a paella feast and games of poker.
Then in August, Ms. Hirschhorn, the founder of Frida, a company that sells baby products, hosted another party, this time for her son's 10th birthday. In addition to a pool with a zip-line, an ice cream truck and a pizza truck, there was a ceramic station with pottery wheels.
This summer in the Hamptons, D.J.s aren't the only ones doing the spinning. A semi-recent fad has taken ahold of the moneyed elite who spend their summer in the coastal destination: clay camp, in which adults and children alike can try out pottery wheels at home and at parties.
Over the past couple of years, Cameron Bishop, the ceramist behind the pop-up service, has split her time between summers in Montauk, N.Y, and winters in Seattle with her daughter, Beau, 8. Ms. Bishop started her clay catering service in the summer of 2021, when people were looking for something creative to do outside -- partly because of the Covid-19 pandemic -- and the business blew up in popularity this year.
She wanted to bring a new source of fun to the Hamptons. "There has to be more to life," Ms. Bishop said, than just wiling away the time living in one's phone.
Ms. Bishop paid her way through eight years of art school -- the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and the Art Institute of Chicago -- by working in high-end hotels. She runs a full studio in Seattle with two kilns and a ceramics line, named Beau Rush Ceramics, that she sells online. Her background in hospitality, she believes, is what makes her service thrive.
Ms. Bishop has secured many of her clients through word of mouth, offering services to friends of friends. "Daphne Oz came to one of the birthdays I did, and the next thing you know, I'm teaching her kids," Ms. Bishop, 41, said. "Later in the week, she came to a class and brought her B.F.F., fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff, and Rebecca also brought some of her kids."
She brings everything needed for a pottery party: the tables, the chairs, the umbrellas, the clay and, of course, the wheels -- which require only water and electricity. "We come, set up for 45 minutes, everyone comes to the class and then we clean up and leave no trace," she said, adding that she later bakes the clay in a kiln so partygoers can keep their creations.
In August, Ms. Bishop was hired in Southampton by Lauren Santo Domingo, a co-founder and the chief brand officer of the luxury site Moda Operandi, to host a class for her children and their friends. "The kids had all just been to a Taylor Swift concert, and they were wearing their Taylor Swift beads on their wrist, and they were worried about getting them dirty," Ms. Bishop said, laughing.
In Sagaponack, at the house of Rebecca Hessel Cohen, the founder of the clothing brand LoveShackFancy, Ms. Bishop set up her class in a lush garden full of pink flowers, near Ms. Cohen's classic pink Moke car.
Ms. Bishop has also been a regular at the British actress Naomi Watts's home in Montauk for two summers now. "I learned about Cameron's ceramics class through friends on Instagram," Ms. Watts said in a text message. Ms. Watts had been cast to play a ceramist on the television show "The Watcher," which debuted in October 2022, and needed a crash course.
"Cameron and I did a few solos, the kids came and did a bit, too, and then I had a couple occasions with friends joining," Ms. Watts said. "We would bask in the afternoon sun with a gin and tonic, chat and create till our hearts were content."
"We all got completely hooked," she added. Ms. Watts later showed off her new pottery skills on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."
The physical aspect of playing with clay can be strangely addicting, which may explain the appeal of pottery making. "I don't know why the wheel is so enticing," said Julia Stegner, 38, a model who hired Ms. Bishop to teach a class for her family. "Maybe it's the playfulness, how quickly you can form this piece of clay into this thing."
"It's so earthy, it's so grounding, and then you can make something that you can use and eat out of," added Ms. Stegner, who is considering buying her own wheel.
For those who don't want to organize a class, Ms. Bishop also sells at-home clay kits (each comes with a piece of canvas, clay, tools, instructions and her contact details to arrange a pick up) online and at Crow's Nest, a waterside restaurant and gift shop in Montauk owned by her friend. They cost $ 95, and afterward Ms. Bishop can take care of the baking. "Sean MacPherson and his family took four of them," Ms. Bishop said.
Ms. Bishop believes that people are often drawn to clay making because it gives them something elusive: a feeling of control.
"At Lauren Santo Domingo's house, some participants were talking about making the piece perfect, and I was like, 'No, no, no, that is not the point,"' Ms. Bishop said. "At the wheel, this thing didn't exist until you put your hands on it, and it can become anything you choose. You have complete and total agency."

The Great 'Plaster Renaissance': [SpecialSections]

Full text: Designers and fabricators are finding new forms for the ornamental material.
This article is part of our Design special section about new interpretations of antique design styles.
If Beth Cayre had to move, she would regret leaving the dining room ceiling, with its plaster cherry blossom branches hand molded by the ceramics artist Matthew Solomon. And who could blame her?
The branches were part of what gave character to her Neo-Grec Upper East Side townhouse when she and her husband, Nathan, gutted the property six years ago and dressed it up with new ornamental details.
Their interior designer, Joe Nahem, envisioned a garden floating above their heads. He asked Mr. Solomon, who was known for making elaborate floral vessels surfaced with ruffled clay petals, how he would feel about doing a plaster ceiling. "He thought I was crazy," Mr. Nahem said, "but was very excited." (Mr. Solomon died in 2021.)
The botanical motif set the tone for the rest of the room -- its damask brocade upholstery, Venetian glass chandeliers and custom embroidered chairs. Six years later, the ceiling still swells the hearts of those who see it.
"The project has longevity," Mr. Nahem said. "Every person who looks at it sees something different without connecting it to a period. That's why it works."
Made from gypsum, a soft mineral that often occurs in a stark white hue, plaster can be found in ancient Egyptian tombs and ancient Greek temples. It's a sort of grace note of traditional Western architecture, the stuff of the gilded ceilings of Versailles, and the cornices and wedding-cake bijoux of Mount Vernon. And now, with a push from social media, plaster ornamentation is on the upswing, becoming shorthand for quiet luxury while bearing the quirks of modern culture.
In contrast to the ornate handwork that was common in the past, the new applications of plaster "are exciting and offer a channel to reinvent past architectural detail," said Alexandra Kaehler, a Chicago-area interior designer. "I know it is not for everyone, but it is fun to see how it is reinterpreted."
Put a hashtag in front of "plaster" on Instagram's search page, and about 912,000 décor-related posts pop up. On TikTok, #plastercraft has more than 673,000 views. Google searches for "frieze architecture" -- referring to a key component of classical architecture -- increased 110 percent in the past 12 months, and "custom made" was a top trending topic relating to cornices.
This surge of love for plaster stems from "not having what other people have," said Mike Fisher, the founder and creative director of Studio Indigo in London.
Plaster ornamentation is an antidote to the austere, gallery-like spaces of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which morphed into modern farmhouse rooms. "White-box interiors don't celebrate craftsmanship," the New York classical architect Peter Pennoyer said, noting that the attention to detail required to execute plaster moldings can be breathtaking.
Plaster can enhance the objects in a room. Mr. Pennoyer, whose new book, "Peter Pennoyer Architects: City/Country," is due out in October, said it is often the choice of clients with contemporary art collections who want more than a featureless wall for a background.
Recently, his firm paired a big Jean-Michel Basquiat painting with a traditional plaster cornice. "This setting is unexpected and challenges us to see the painting in a new way," he said.
Plaster ornamentation tends to have a grounding effect. "That safety of the past gives us comfort to look to the future," said Rachael H. Grochowski, the founder of the architecture and design firm RHG A+D, in Montclair, N.J. "Our inherent humanity encourages us to explore, but in the confines of knowing that there is something familiar."
Which is why, for a circa-1910 Tudor Revival house in Montclair, Ms. Grochowski accentuated the white Gothic curves of the original tracery plaster ceilings by outlining them with a fresh coat of jet-black paint.
Adrian J. Taylor, the principal of Hyde Park Mouldings, a plaster fabricator in Hauppauge, N.Y., has gone so far as to declare that we are currently living in the midst of a "plaster renaissance." After a long drought of interest in ornamental plaster in the post-World War II era -- when contractors around the country fell in love with drywall -- "people are realizing what a fantastic material it is," he said.
A new breed of computer-controlled modeling tools is making it easier to create what Mr. Taylor described as "ceiling landscapes." Now, he said, almost all plaster ornament is prefabricated rather than molded on-site in a messy process of shaping liquid plaster of Paris with a metal blade.
As designers and contractors update their techniques, they also modernize classical profiles and patterns. For a traditional stone manor built eight years ago in New Jersey, Mr. Pennoyer's firm introduced a Corinthian cornice without slipping into a time capsule. Rather than bearing the usual frilly acanthus foliage, the cornice was given large, sleek leaves with protruding tips.
"Abstraction is really important," Mr. Pennoyer said. "You don't have to follow the pattern book. It's not about showing off your historical knowledge, but about enjoying the sculptural potential of plaster."
Inspired by the British Regency architect Sir John Soane, Mr. Fisher designed plasterwork for a 19th-century Notting Hill villa in London that called to mind a string of pearls, but also his client's favorite sport. "We ended up calling it the golf ball cornice," he said.
For Adam Bergeron, the founder and chief executive of Inspired Ornamental, in Salem, N.H., the pandemic sparked new creative adventures in plaster. As many Bostonians relocated to vacation homes on Cape Cod and on Martha's Vineyard, some asked for details that reflected their new locations. Mr. Bergeron invented what appeared to be a new category: plaster ocean décor.
His fabrication company found itself specializing in sea life medallions: "We cast 50 different sand dollars to make a master mold" capturing "all the individual holes" that appear on the creature's exoskeleton, he said. The studio did the same with starfish and scallop shells. (The company had already transformed a Boston restaurant's cellar dining room into catacombs, casting plaster replicas of 2,500 human skulls and more than 1,800 thigh bones for the ceiling, walls and fireplace area.)
Even a delicate dose of plaster ornamentation can be totally showstopping. Ms. Kaehler looked to dandelions gone to seed when designing a ceiling medallion for the dining room of the Lake Forest Showhouse & Gardens 2023, in suburban Chicago. She worked with Chicago Ornamental Plastering to create the "exploding" petal spray. "If the plaster is too thin, then it feels flat and you lose that movement. Too thick, and it comes off as heavy and bulky," she explained.
If the last two or three years on social media have taught us anything, it is that people are braver in their design choices, said Adam Hunter, a Los Angeles interior designer. For a client who wanted to wink at traditional style, Mr. Hunter introduced plaster bands swirling around a tray ceiling in a slightly amorphous oval shape, almost like a pool of water. It was finished with a mixture of plaster and Roman clay.
"The ethereal texture is supposed to be modern, but looks like it's been there all along," Mr. Hunter said. Plaster ornament, he added, "is a beautiful investment that is here to stay."

Social Media Magnifies Cultural Rifts Exposed By Rape Cases in Italy: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A summer of horrific crimes, including the gang rapes of two young girls, has put a new focus on the country's attitudes toward women and the amplifying role of social media.
Shattered glass surrounds the abandoned swimming pool, along with dilapidated benches, broken tiles and a single dirty mattress. Local police officers have identified the forsaken spot as one of the places where they say two young girls were repeatedly raped by a gang of their peers, all residents of the Italian town of Caivano, on the outskirts of Naples.
Though the rapes of the two girls, cousins just 10 and 12 years old, took place over many months, they seized national attention this past week after they were reported by the local news media, hurling the issue of violence against women and girls in Italy back into the spotlight.
Those assaults were among a host of horrific crimes that have been all over the news this summer. Two weeks ago, the focus was on a group of seven young men, including one 17-year-old, who are under investigation in the rape of a 19-year-old woman in Palermo. Before that, there were cases of women being stabbed, shot or poisoned by their partners or those known to them.
The cases have provoked debate in Italy over its neglected areas, its often chauvinistic attitudes toward women and the dangerous amplifying role played by social media. They have also exposed deep divisions over the persistence of the problem of violence against women and how to address it.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited Caivano, almost certainly a first for the working-class town of 37,800, where heroin addicts inject openly during the day. Italy's first woman to hold the office, and the first from the far right, Ms. Meloni skated past the many issues pertaining to women, focusing instead on law and order and calling the crimes "barbaric."
"This territory will be cleaned up, and you will soon see the results of our presence here," she said, referring to the problems of "illegality and drugs." She pledged to reopen the sports center, build a new multimedia library and send more teachers to Caivano's schools.
"There can't be stateless zones in Italy," she said, speaking from the courtyard of the local school. "And I am telling this to the many Caivanos of Italy."
A day before Ms. Meloni's visit, dozens of police officers kept watch on street corners and in parks where the grass grew knee-high. In the wake of the violence, local officials said they would send more officers to patrol the area.
"We don't need more policemen," said one older resident, Antonio, who declined to give his full name for fear of being ostracized in his neighborhood. "We need more time in school, more social workers and more psychologists to help children in families who can't take care of them."
The two young cousins grew up in public housing in the Rione I.A.C.P. district, in what neighbors described as troubled families. A juvenile court decided to move them to a foster home. Their case is under investigation, and no charges have yet been filed.
"Now that the girls are safe with the competent authorities, we need to think about all the other kids who live here," said Bruno Mazza, the president of the A Childhood to Live organization, which runs the only afternoon activities for children in that neighborhood. "We can't move everybody out -- we need to start from here and now."
Advocates for women say cases of violence against women and girls are not necessarily growing, but they get more sensational attention in the summer months when news cycles are slow.
Experts said the numbers in Italy, where 27 percent of women say they have experienced violence, were roughly in line with those of other European countries.
"These are cases that resonate, but they are unfortunately nothing new," said Antonella Veltri, the president of the Network of Women Against Violence, which runs shelters across the country. "This is a cultural phenomenon, deeply rooted in a chauvinist society for decades."
"Now it's taking a new, even more horrible turn with social media that acts like a megaphone," she said.
Ms. Veltri was referring to the sensation created by another recent case of gang rape in Palermo, which is still under investigation. This summer, seven young men met a 19-year-old woman at a downtown club. According to the police, they persuaded the bartender to pour her several drinks, encouraged her to smoke marijuana and then took her to an isolated warehouse, where they raped her, beat her and filmed the abuse.
A frame from security video that appeared in the news media showed them carrying her through the streets, as she could barely walk. Another shot showed them leaving her on the ground as they headed to a nearby deli.
Italian newspapers published leaked excerpts alleged to be from the men's WhatsApp messages and conversations. In one, the night was described as "100 cats on top of a bitch." In a tapped conversation, one of the rapists reportedly said it was disgusting because it was "too many" on her, but he justified it by saying "flesh is flesh."
Eventually the names and addresses of those accused in the case became public, and their social media accounts were filled with insults. But the same was true of the woman's Instagram account. In an interview in an Italian newspaper, she spoke of having suicidal thoughts. The authorities eventually took her to a shelter.
Hundreds of celebrities as well as regular Italians expressed support for the woman with the hashtag "I am not flesh." The father of a girl who was raped in 2020 in Rome wrote a letter to the newspaper La Repubblica in which he described the "ordeal of having your dignity broken."
His daughter was 16 at the time and, he said, still had suicidal thoughts. "A rape is an intricate puzzle of betrayals," he wrote. "The betrayals of those who use you as an object, and of those who see in you, the victim who decided to report it to the police to protect everybody, an annoyance to get rid of, exactly like you were just a disposable container for animal ejaculations."
According to a recent report from the national statistics agency ISTAT, there is still a pervasive view in Italy that women who are abused were somehow at fault, courting the aggression.
That attitude was echoed this week by Andrea Giambruno, an anchorman on a national commercial television channel, who is also Ms. Meloni's partner and the father of her daughter.
Everyone had a right to enjoy themselves and even get drunk, he said, but if women avoided getting drunk, they might avoid "getting found by the wolf."
The remark caused an uproar among leftist politicians and activists. Mr. Giambruno, expressing disgust for his critics, defended himself by reminding them that, in the same broadcast, he had called the rapists "beasts" and their acts "abominable."
Ms. Meloni has not publicly addressed his remarks.
The idea that women's actions or clothing can trigger violence permeates even the courts in Italy, where sexuality and sexual violence are still not always differentiated.
This year, a court in Florence acquitted two 19-year-olds who were accused of raping an 18-year-old at a party, finding that there had been a "mistaken perception of consensus," since she had slept with one of them in the past.
The European Court of Human Rights and U.N. authorities have often condemned Italy's courts for decisions in rape cases that used offensive language: One acquitted the accused and said he had been "passionate," and another victim was called "uninhibited."
Such treatment discourages women from coming forward, said Ilaria Boiano, a lawyer for the Differenza Donna women's association, which runs the national emergency number for women who are victims of violence.
"The latest cases are just the tip of the iceberg, unfortunately," she said. "Many women don't even report it."

Voice Deepfakes Are Coming for Your Bank Balance

Full text: Enlarge this image.
This spring, Clive Kabatznik, an investor in Florida, called his local Bank of America representative to discuss a big money transfer he was planning to make. Then he called again.
Except the second phone call wasn’t from Kabatznik. Rather, a software program had artificially generated his voice and tried to trick the banker into moving the money elsewhere.
Kabatznik and his banker were the targets of a cutting-edge scam attempt that has grabbed the attention of cybersecurity experts: the use of artificial intelligence to generate voice deepfakes, or vocal renditions that mimic real people’s voices.
The problem is still new enough that there is no comprehensive accounting of how often it happens. But one expert whose company, Pindrop, monitors the audio traffic for many of the largest U.S. banks said he had seen a jump in its prevalence this year — and in the sophistication of scammers’ voice fraud attempts. Another large voice authentication vendor, Nuance, saw its first successful deepfake attack on a financial services client late last year.
In Kabatznik’s case, the fraud was detectable. But the speed of technological development, the falling costs of generative artificial intelligence programs and the wide availability of recordings of people’s voices on the internet have created the perfect conditions for voice-related AI scams.
Customer data such as bank account details that have been stolen by hackers — and are widely available on underground markets — help scammers pull off these attacks. They become even easier with wealthy clients, whose public appearances, including speeches, are often widely available on the internet. Finding audio samples for everyday customers can also be as easy as conducting an online search — say, on social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram — for the name of someone whose bank account information the scammers already have.
“There’s a lot of audio content out there,” said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, the CEO and a founder of Pindrop, which reviews automatic voice-verification systems for eight of the 10 largest U.S. lenders.
Over the past decade, Pindrop has reviewed recordings of more than 5 billion calls coming into call centers run by the financial companies it serves. The centers handle products such as bank accounts, credit cards and other services offered by big retail banks. All of the call centers receive calls from fraudsters, typically ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 a year. It’s common for 20 calls to come in from fraudsters each week, Balasubramaniyan said.
So far, fake voices created by computer programs account for only “a handful” of these calls, he said — and they’ve begun to happen only within the past year.
Most of the fake voice attacks that Pindrop has seen have come into credit card service call centers, where human representatives deal with customers needing help with their cards.
Balasubramaniyan played a reporter an anonymized recording of one such call that took place in March. Although a very rudimentary example — the voice in this case sounds robotic, more like an e-reader than a person — the call illustrates how scams could occur as AI makes it easier to imitate human voices.
A banker can be heard greeting the customer. Then the voice, similar to an automated one, says, “My card was declined.”
“May I ask whom I have the pleasure of speaking with?” the banker replies.
“My card was declined,” the voice says again.
The banker asks for the customer’s name again. A silence ensues, during which the faint sound of keystrokes can be heard. According to Balasubramaniyan, the number of keystrokes correspond to the number of letters in the customer’s name. The fraudster is typing words into a program that then reads them.
In this instance, the caller’s synthetic speech led the employee to transfer the call to a different department and flag it as potentially fraudulent, Balasubramaniyan said.
Calls like the one he shared, which use type-to-text technology, are some of the easiest attacks to defend against: Call centers can use screening software to pick up technical clues that speech is machine-generated.
“Synthetic speech leaves artifacts behind, and a lot of anti-spoofing algorithms key off those artifacts,” said Peter Soufleris, CEO of IngenID, a voice biometrics technology vendor.
But, as with many security measures, it’s an arms race between attackers and defenders — and one that has recently evolved. A scammer can now simply speak into a microphone or type in a prompt and have that speech very quickly translated into the target’s voice.
Balasubramaniyan noted that one generative AI system, Microsoft’s VALL-E, could create a voice deepfake that said whatever a user wished using just three seconds of sampled audio.
On “60 Minutes” in May, Rachel Tobac, a security consultant, used software to so convincingly clone the voice of Sharyn Alfonsi, one of the program’s correspondents, that she fooled a “60 Minutes” employee into giving her Alfonsi’s passport number.
The attack took only five minutes to put together, said Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security. The tool she used became available for purchase in January.
While scary deepfake demos are a staple of security conferences, real-life attacks are still extremely rare, said Brett Beranek, general manager of security and biometrics at Nuance, a voice technology vendor that Microsoft acquired in 2021. The only successful breach of a Nuance customer, in October, took the attacker more than a dozen attempts to pull off.
Beranek’s biggest concern is not attacks on call centers or automated systems, like the voice biometrics systems that many banks have deployed. He worries about the scams in which a caller reaches an individual directly.
“I had a conversation just earlier this week with one of our customers,” he said. “They were saying, hey, Brett, it’s great that we have our contact center secured — but what if somebody just calls our CEO directly on their cellphone and pretends to be somebody else?”
That’s what happened in Kabatznik’s case. According to the banker’s description, he appeared to be trying to get her to transfer money to a new location, but the voice was repetitive, talking over her and using garbled phrases. The banker hung up.
“It was like I was talking to her, but it made no sense,” Kabatznik said she had told him. (A Bank of America spokesperson declined to make the banker available for an interview.)
After two more calls like that came through in quick succession, the banker reported the matter to Bank of America’s security team, Kabatznik said. Concerned about the security of Kabatznik’s account, she stopped responding to his calls and emails — even the ones that were coming from the real Kabatznik. It took about 10 days for the two of them to reestablish a connection, when Kabatznik arranged to visit her at her office.
“We regularly train our team to identify and recognize scams and help our clients avoid them,” said William Halldin, a Bank of America spokesperson. He said he could not comment on specific customers or their experiences.
Although the attacks are getting more sophisticated, they stem from a basic cybersecurity threat that has been around for decades: a data breach that reveals the personal information of bank customers. From 2020 to 2022, bits of personal data on more than 300 million people fell into the hands of hackers, leading to $8.8 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
Once they’ve harvested a batch of numbers, hackers sift through the information and match it to real people. Those who steal the information are almost never the same people who end up with it. Instead, the thieves put it up for sale. Specialists can use any one of a handful of easily accessible programs to spoof target customers’ phone numbers — which is what likely happened in Kabatznik’s case.
Recordings of his voice are easy to find. On the internet there are videos of him speaking at a conference and participating in a fundraiser.
“I think it’s pretty scary,” Kabatznik said. “The problem is, I don’t know what you do about it. Do you just go underground and disappear?”

Here to Help; How to Have a 'Sexual State of the Union': [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In her new book, the sex educator Emily Morse argues that every couple should have a frank conversation -- ideally, once a month.
Work, kids, health -- countless factors can get in the way of good sex. But Emily Morse, a sex educator, believes one roadblock tends to loom larger than the others.
"Most of the sexual problems in our relationships have nothing to do with sex, and everything to do with communication," Ms. Morse writes in her new book, "Smart Sex."
Addressing intimacy isn't always easy, she acknowledged: "Conversations around sex are not normalized at all." But Ms. Morse's raison d'être across her various platforms is to encourage people to talk openly about sex -- to identify what they want, and to learn how to say it.
She has a long-running podcast, "Sex With Emily," and more than 500,000 followers on Instagram, where she explores a variety of topics, from the best sex toys to confidence in the bedroom. A 2021 article in The New York Times likened Ms. Morse, who studied at the now-defunct Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, to the iconic Dr. Ruth.
In "Smart Sex," she breaks down her rallying cry about communication into a handful of specific sex talks she believes are useful for couples to have. Among them is the "sexual state of the union" -- a monthly check-in to help determine what's working, what's not and where things are headed next.
The Times talked to Ms. Morse about some strategies from her new book that she believes can help couples have an effective sexual state of the union, and why she thinks it is worthwhile -- even if the idea makes you or your partner cringe.
1. Keep it brief.
A successful sexual state of the union shouldn't last more than 10 minutes or so, Ms. Morse said. She believes that it can be helpful for couples to think about it as preventive care.
"You're planting the seeds for the sex life to come," she explained. "You're going to learn: What worked? What didn't work? And then how can we improve going forward?"
Ms. Morse recommends having the talk once a month (scheduled or more spontaneous, depending on the couple), though that frequency isn't dictated by research. It's based on her hunch that once a month feels manageable even when life is busy, and that it offers people enough time and space to do a bit of reflecting on what has been happening in their sex lives.
2. Expect it to be awkward.
Ms. Morse is adamant that good sex doesn't just happen. Nor does talking about it somehow rob it of its "magic" -- even if the resulting conversations are uncomfortable, or down right clumsy.
It can help to openly acknowledge any discomfort you might feel, she said. "In the moment, you can tell your partner: 'Look, I know that this is new for us, but I want us to have a growth mind-set around our sexual connection,"' Ms. Morse said, noting her firm belief that vulnerability is essential for true intimacy.
"If it feels unsexy because you're both nervous, that's OK," she added. "This isn't, like, a foreplay exercise."
3. Start by asking: 'What would you like to see more of in our sex life?'
Or consider other options, such as: "What can I do more of to make sex satisfying for you?" Or: "May I share something I'd like more of during sex?"
"What are you enjoying about our sex life right now?" is another option, although Ms. Morse acknowledges that is probably not a great conversation starter for those in the midst of a sexual drought, for instance.
In an ideal world, couples would get in the habit of having a regular sexual state of the union early in their relationship, Ms. Morse said, though she does believe it is a muscle that can be developed with practice -- whether you have been together for "10 months or 10 years," or beyond.
But if those sorts of questions feel impossible to ask, or if your partner is utterly unwilling to answer them, that's a sign you may benefit from sex therapy, she said.
4. Pay attention to timing, tone and turf.
Often, when you talk about sex is as important as the actual words you use, Ms. Morse says. So make sure neither of you is hungry, angry, lonely or tired, or HALT, as you set out to discuss sex, she said. Doing so makes you and your partner less likely to be reactive or defensive.
And strive for a tone that is curious, compassionate and open, she said.
"A lot of us, when we have these intense conversations, our tone gets defensive -- though we don't mean it to be," Ms. Morse said.
She insists conversations about sex should take place outside the bedroom, which she argues should be a sanctuary for sleep and sex -- and nothing else. It may help to bring it up during an outdoor stroll, she said. You and your partner can both take a few deep breaths, and do not necessarily have to hold eye contact.
"I want people to remember that the sexual state of the union is not criticism," Ms. Morse said. "It's an opportunity to collaborate."

Buying and Selling the Ex-President: [Style Desk]

Full text: Both sides are trying to profit from reducing this moment to a whole lotta merch.
After the mug shot, the marketing.
Since former President Donald J. Trump's booking photo was released by the Fulton County, Ga., Sheriff's Office late on Aug. 23, it has exploded across hundreds of T-shirts and tchotchkes.
First out of the gate, not surprisingly, was the Trump campaign itself, which overnight splashed the picture on a variety of merch. Hours later, the Never Trumpers, otherwise known as the Lincoln Project, had also reproduced the mug shot on a -- pun alert -- shot glass, along with the acronym "F.A.F.O." and the exhortation to "Raise a glass to justice." Not long after that, Green Day, the punk band, offered a T-shirt on Instagram that had swapped out the portraits on the cover of its 1997 "Nimrod" album with the mug shot.
Between the two poles is a veritable bonanza of stuff on sites like Redbubble and Etsy, where if you search "Trump mug shot," more than a dozen pages of products come up, pro-Trump and anti-Trump alike. See, for example, a T-shirt by LemonGoats that features the booking photo and the line "Grab him by the penal code."
But what does it mean, exactly, that no matter our allegiances at this particular moment, or our different versions of recent history, we share a common ground right in the middle of an ocean of consumer kitsch? That while we may have lost the skill of constructive dialogue, we all still speak T-shirt?
"It shows the cynicism of late capitalism and the era we are in," said Wendy A. Woloson, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Camden and the author of "Crap: A History of Cheap Stuff in America."
"Normally you would be ashamed of a mug shot and what it represents," Ms. Woloson said, "but this is a way for both sides to own it. Literally. To domesticate it and make it safe by turning it into a commodity."
Who benefits, really, from such transubstantiation is a more complicated question.
The day after the mug shot was taken, Chris LaCivita, one of Mr. Trump's advisers, posted a warning on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to anyone considering "raising money off the mug shot of @realDonaldTrump." If you have not received an official OK, he wrote, "WE ARE COMING AFTER YOU."
But, Susan Scafidi, the founder of the Fashion Law Institute, said that federal law does not protect the right to publicize your own likeness -- albeit in some cases "protection against false endorsement or association may apply."
"Trump could, in theory, attempt to shut down sales of merch with his mug shot," Ms. Scafidi said, "not unlike the way Obama objected to appearing on a Weatherproof Garment Company billboard, but I suspect his legal team is busy with other matters."
Besides, she continued, "the U.S. Copyright Act excludes from protection any works created by the federal government, but not state or local governments, so technically the state of Georgia owns the photo, subject to fair use limitations." In any case, neither concern appears to have stopped anyone.
The Trump campaign has made out very well, as you might expect from a man whose greatest product has always been himself, and whose view on the world often seems to involve the monetization of all things.
Buying any product from a candidate's store equates directly to money in their campaign bank account, since under federal law any such purchase is actually a donation; the object is the premium you get in return. On Aug. 26, Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, posted on X that since the mug shot was taken, the campaign had taken in $ 7.1 million, with " $ 4.18 million yesterday (Friday) alone, the highest grossing day of the entire campaign."
It's the same story at the Lincoln Project, where Rick Wilson, a co-founder, said that shot glasses (one of 10 possible mug shot-related products the creative team had tested) were the fastest-selling product the organization had made since 2020. All proceeds, he said, would go toward their media campaign to raise awareness about the "threat to the Republic" they believe Mr. Trump represents.
"It's a way to capture a moment like this in a way that turns Trump's notoriety and infamy back on itself," Mr. Wilson said. To use that notoriety to a different end, the Green Day tee is being sold to benefit Greater Good Music, a charity helping the victims of the Maui wildfires.
What they and all those involved, including the Etsy and Redbubble sellers -- who are simply profiting off a cultural convulsion -- understand is that, increasingly, our politics aren't real unless they are advertised. Or maybe they are too real, until they are reduced to the digestible level of advertising.
"It's a way to trivialize a larger issue, to reduce a complex context to the status of a simplistic message," said Marita Sturken, the author of "Tourists of History: Memory, Kitsch, and Consumerism from Oklahoma City to Ground Zero" and a professor at N.Y.U. Steinhardt. It is, she noted, a hallmark of early 21st-century American culture.
In a sense, consumption has become a way to process our experience, to reduce what could be an overwhelming sense of anxiety or fear sparked by a national event involving allegations of insurrection and threats to the constitution by remaking it and recoding it as a joke product.
"Americans have been defining themselves through their consumption patterns for centuries," Ms. Woloson said. "Other cultures do it too, but we do it on steroids." This is simply what she calls the ultimate "encrapification" of that tendency.
The problem is, in reducing big issues to the level of cheapish everyday stuff, both sides are also normalizing them. They are creating a situation in which we all get suckered into the idea that the current turmoil is a souvenir to be acquired and then stuck in a drawer, rather than confronted. Is that really something to be proud about buying into?

After Summer's Natural Disasters, Cue the Climate Conspiracies: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Hsu, Tiffany

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Misattributed videos, recycled lies and warped fears are fueling unfounded claims about the recent record-breaking heat, floods and wildfires.
As natural disasters and extreme environmental conditions became more commonplace around the world this summer, scientists pointed repeatedly to a shared driver: climate change.
Conspiracy theorists pointed to anything but.
Some claimed falsely that the record-smashing heat waves blistering parts of North America, Europe and Asia were normal, and that they had been sensationalized as part of a globalist hoax. Others made up tales that cloud-seeding airplanes or a nearby dam, rather than torrential rains, had caused the unusually intense flooding in northern Italy (and in places like Vermont and Rwanda).
The devastating wildfire on Maui this month produced especially ludicrous claims. Social media that racked up millions of views blamed the blaze on a "directed energy weapon" (the evidence: years-old footage not recorded in Hawaii). And as Florida braced this week for Hurricane Idalia, some people claimed incorrectly online that such storms are not affected by fossil fuel emissions.
The unfounded claims that now regularly follow natural disasters and dangerous weather, contradicting a preponderance of scientific evidence, can often seem frivolous and fantastical. They persist, however -- attracting large audiences and frustrating climate experts, who say the world has little time to evade a global warming catastrophe.
The claims can start with blog posts paid for by the oil and gas industry, or from rumors shared among neighbors. Online forums are filled with comments in multiple languages that reject both the science behind fossil fuel emissions and the scientists' authority. Sometimes, they are amplified by top politicians and pundits -- the Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, for example, called climate change a "hoax" during the first primary debate last week.
"It's really one of the worst challenges we have to deal with," said Eleni Myrivili, the chief heat officer for the United Nations human settlements program, who also works on heat issues for the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center.
After holding a similar role for the city of Athens, which was threatened by a ruinous spate of wildfires this month, Dr. Myrivili said climate misinformation was "one of the most painful things because it's like adding insult to injury."
Outright climate deniers are a minority: 74 percent of Americans believe global warming is happening, versus 15 percent who do not, according to a survey conducted in the spring by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. However, while 61 percent understand that humans are mostly at fault -- the consensus of nearly all of the scientific community -- 28 percent say the phenomenon is a largely natural evolution.
Experts said the tactics and tenor of climate denial had evolved. For decades, the oil and gas industry spent billions of dollars waging a coordinated and highly technical campaign to influence public opinion against climate science, and then climate action. Recently, conspiracy theorists and extremists have operated in a more decentralized way, generating revenue through deceptive clickbait about global warming.
"Those two universes of actors have collided with each other in the online space and basically found a marriage of convenience," said Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that studies online platforms. "You have the informal and the formal, the traditional and the very digital now occupying the same ecosystem and ramping it up to new extremes."
The consequences from global warming are complex. Natural disasters and extreme weather events would still occur without it, albeit on a smaller scale, for example. That helps fuel many false narratives, said Susannah Crockford, an environmental anthropologist at the University of Exeter in England.
Dr. Crockford, who studies climate denial, said she was sympathetic to the urge to concoct explanations that shifted responsibility away from climate change toward a boogeyman like arsonists or "the elite."
"Blaming a specific enemy makes it easier to fight -- you just have to get rid of the bad people that are making this happen, and then the problem goes away," Dr. Crockford said.
This summer, conspiracy theories about climate change followed familiar patterns. Deniers described it as a tyrannical control tactic -- an effort to relocate rural residents to cities to be better monitored, to compel people to isolate indoors or to force a shift to renewable energy by sabotaging the fossil fuel industry.
Climate Action Against Disinformation, a coalition of dozens of groups combating false narratives, analyzed claims about wildfires over the past three years. In a report last month, the organization demonstrated how such claims are recycled and adapted for the zeitgeist. The Black Lives Matter movement and antifa protesters were scapegoats when wildfires erupted in California, Oregon and Washington in 2020. By the time Canada faced its own wildfires this summer, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was being baselessly linked to eco-terrorist activity.
In Maui, fears that predatory developers would swoop in after the fire quickly warped into unsupported claims that wealthy real estate investors had caused the blaze. Video of Hawaii's governor saying the state might acquire land in Lahaina to protect it for locals was manipulated and offered as misleading proof that his plan was to buy land to create a technologically advanced "smart city."
One YouTube video shared unfounded claims that Oprah Winfrey had a hand in starting the inferno on the island, hoping to seize land from Indigenous residents. As proof, the video's host noted that Ms. Winfrey had recently bought a sizable plot on Maui (she has lived part time on the island for 15 years) and that her holdings had escaped this month's inferno (her home was miles away from the closest blaze). The host added another supposed red flag: In one interview about the fire, Ms. Winfrey failed to appear sufficiently sad.
Ms. Winfrey did not respond to a request for comment.
County officials in Maui had warned for years about the risk of climate change causing more frequent and intense wildfires. Experts later suggested that the Lahaina blaze had been stoked by worsening drought conditions, low humidity and gales linked to a hurricane hundreds of miles away.
Global warming, however, did not factor into the false theories that surged through social media. One TikTok user said that "some people caught pictures of the lasers coming down and starting the fire on Maui." As evidence, she shared two images: one from the SpaceX Instagram account showing the company's Falcon 9 rocket launching from California in 2018, the other from a five-year-old photo posted to Facebook after a controlled flare from an oil refinery in Ohio. (Other images claiming to capture a "direct energy weapon" at work in Maui show transformer explosions in Chile and Louisiana.)
Climate activists are concerned that social platforms and technology like artificial intelligence will help produce and hasten the spread of misinformation about natural disasters and extreme weather.
This year, researchers found ads from retailers, electronics manufacturers and airlines accompanying YouTube videos that falsely claimed that the rainforest was too humid to catch fire or that the world was cooling. (YouTube has said it removes ads from videos denying climate change.) A report this month from Pomona College found that, within six months of Elon Musk's taking over Twitter, nearly half of users who had regularly discussed the environment were no longer active.
Scientists and other climate change experts are being besieged by personal attacks, including claims that they are shills for a globalist cabal or other shadowy forces, said Ms. King of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Eroding trust in experts traps everyone in an "antechamber of discussion," bickering about credibility rather than taking action.
"The danger is not that people hold unpalatable views in and of themselves," she said. "It's more our inability to have a good-faith conversation about these absolutely critical issues in the years ahead."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Berlin's public prosecutor's office dropped its investigation, citing a lack of evidence for allegations that Mr. Lindemann had drugged young women in order to have sex with them.
Berlin's public prosecutor's office on Tuesday said it had dropped its sexual assault investigation into Till Lindemann, the frontman for the rock band Rammstein, citing a lack of evidence.
The investigation began in June after several women said that Mr. Lindemann had plied young people with alcohol and drugs before, during and after concerts in order to have sex with them. Lawyers for Mr. Lindemann denied those claims in a statement and threatened legal action against those making the claims and news outlets reporting on them.
"I thank all those who have waited impartially for the end of the investigation," Mr. Lindemann, 60, posted to Instagram on Tuesday.
When the German news media reported on the allegations of impropriety against the leader of one of the country's most successful modern music groups, commercial partners ended their ties with Mr. Lindemann. Universal, which distributes Rammstein's music, said it would stop any promotional activities. And politicians condemned the described behavior.
"We need more awareness about abuse of power and sexualized violence, and not only in the music industry, but in the whole cultural industry," Claudia Roth, Germany's culture minister, told Der Spiegel, a newsweekly, adding, "The times of foul machismo combined with abuse of power up to sexualized violence should really and definitely be over."
According to the prosecutor's office, however, it was impossible to substantiate the reports against Mr. Lindemann because so many accusations were made anonymously. Kaya Loska, a prominent influencer who had described her experience backstage during a concert in 2022, was interviewed by prosecutors. But they said she was of little help because she did not witness any crimes being committed.
"It was therefore not possible to sufficiently substantiate any allegations of the crimes, nor was it possible to gain an impression of the credibility of the alleged injured parties and the believability of their statements during questioning," Sebastian Büchner, who speaks for the public prosecutor's office, wrote in a statement.
Shelby Lynn, a former fan of the band, helped make the allegations public when she posted on social media about her experience at a concert in Vilnius in May, during which she believed she was drugged. Ms. Lynn took her complaint to the Lithuanian police, but they declined to investigate.

New Recall for Trader Joe's. This Time, Tainted Tamales.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company cited potential milk contamination of the tamales. Other products had potentially been contaminated with rocks, insects and metal.
Trader Joe's has issued a recall of a brand of black bean tamales, the sixth item that the popular grocery chain has recalled since July.
The company said last week that it had recalled packages of Texas Tamale Company Gourmet Black Bean Tamales because they might contain undeclared milk.
"Individuals with an allergy or heightened sensitivity to milk run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products," the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.
The affected tamales were filled with white cheese and hatch green chiles instead of black beans, the F.D.A. said.
Trader Joe's said that no illnesses had been reported in connection with the latest recall and that all potentially affected products had been removed from sale.
Customers have been warned in recent weeks that other products might have been contaminated with rocks, insects and metal.
In July, Trader Joe's said that it had removed cookies because they may have contained rocks and its Unexpected Broccoli Cheddar Soup because it may have contained insects. On Aug. 17, Trader Joe's said that its multigrain crackers with sunflower and flax seeds were recalled because of potential metal contamination.
The recalls have led to some concern among fans of the grocery chain, which has more than 500 stores across the country and is known among loyal customers as a hub for unique snacks and ready-to-eat meals. Its popularity has even spawned Trader Joe's food review Instagram accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.
Nakia Rohde, a spokeswoman for Trader Joe's, said in a statement on Wednesday that "we err on the side of caution and are proactive in addressing issues. We voluntarily take action quickly and aggressively -- investigating potential problems and removing a product from sale if there is any doubt about its safety or quality."
She added that the company does not "wait for regulatory agencies to tell us what to do," and that it shares news of recalls through in-store signs, on its website and via email alerts.
"The close timing of these recalls is coincidental," Ms. Rohde said.
Darin Detwiler, an associate professor of food safety and corporate social responsibility at Northeastern University, said that "in a way, it's good" that Trader Joe's recalls are so public and transparent because "it's a sign that things are working."
"Trader Joe's is doing a great job in making sure that if they have to do a recall, not only do they do it, but they communicate it as well as they can," Dr. Detwiler said.
He added that such recalls are frequent in grocery stores, but stores with name brands like Trader Joe's receive more attention. Dr. Detwiler also noted that the source of the recalls has been from Trader Joe's suppliers, which are smaller and typically not associated with other stores.
Still, he said, most of the items people buy at Trader Joe's are ready-to-eat foods or commercially packaged goods, which means there are more manufacturing and processing steps involved in those products. Those extra steps mean there are "more opportunities for there to be" errors like rocks or metal ending up in a product.
"The fact that this company is being as public and transparent as they are is a very good sign," Dr. Detwiler said.
He added, "This just happens to be a bad string of hits for them."

Delicious Korean for the Budget-Minded: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: New York's high-end Korean restaurants are impressive. They're also expensive. Here are seven options where you won't go broke.
Yes, you can eat standout Korean food without going broke
I wrote this week about the rapid rise in Manhattan of Korean restaurants that qualify as fine dining, including Jungsik, Atomix, Cote and Oiji Mi. The term fine dining implies a certain attentiveness in service and, on the plate, an attention to detail that can become quite elaborate. The most useful way to define it, though, is as a price bracket. With some exceptions, fine dining is more expensive than other styles.
If you're in a fine-dining restaurant that knows what it's doing, then you should be rewarded for the money you're spending with a memorable, pleasurable meal. And most of the dozen or so high-end places I write about will do just that, while rewiring your ideas about Korean flavors.
But what if you aren't in the market for an expensive dinner? The good news is that New York City and nearby New Jersey, particularly Fort Lee and Edgewater, are full of Korean restaurants for every budget. Here are a few that are quite a bit less expensive than some of the hushed tasting counters. And keep in mind Haenyeo, in Brooklyn. I mention it in the article but it's worth mentioning twice.
Bonjuk
The menu of this tranquil restaurant, with branches in Queens and Fort Lee, N.J. is a masterpiece of misdirection. The photos make katsu cutlets and seafood bibimbap look especially appealing, but you can get those in other places. Meanwhile, the star of Bonjuk, a thick, creamy, restorative bowl of savory rice called juk, appears under the ominous heading "nutritional porridge."
Daesung Korean Noodle
The dining room is more inviting after a pandemic renovation that covered nearly every surface in warm, pale wood, like a sauna. But Daesung has been setting the standard for noodle soups in the Korean area of Queens for years. There are two varieties: kalguksu, with long, slurpable strands cut by knife; and sujebi, in which the broth is populated by shards and rags of dough torn by hand.
I Am Kimchi
In this compact and perpetually busy restaurant, half the customers will be eating Korean standbys, like fermented soybean stew or bulgogi hot pot. The other half comes for the pork cutlet under melted cheese, or pasta carbonara in so much sauce it's practically a soup. Only a few items cost more than $ 15, and some of those will feed two or three people.
Cho Dang Gol
Cho Dang Gol has allowed fried chicken and other dishes to infiltrate the menu, but it is still unrivaled in its commitment to the Korean art of cooking with tofu. Tofu appears in many forms: in compressed tiles that stay intact on a hot griddle; in creamy slabs that cleave apart at the touch of a spoon; in downy, ricotta-like curds that leaven stews and bibimbaps.
Jeju Noodle Bar
Douglas Kim, the chef here, has the skill, eye for ingredients and inclination toward refining his ideas that would allow him to charge tasting-menu prices. The $ 150 rack of lamb may need to be put on an installment plan, but by and large he keeps things fairly modest, with a focus on elegantly accessorized noodle soups.
Okdongsik
The specialty -- and the only thing to eat, aside from the dumplings, which are also excellent -- is pork gomtang. It's nothing but white rice in steaming, translucent broth topped with shaved pork, but the kitchen brings each element to its ideal state.
Woorijiip
Gone are the steam tables that once awed hungry Midtown office workers in droves. Now nearly every Korean classic you might possibly have an urge for -- baked mackerel, octopus in chile sauce, and on and on -- is packed up and stacked on shelves. If your meal needs reheating, make a detour to one of the waiting microwaves.
What I'm reading
I wrote in last week's newsletter about the tinned-fish treasures at El Pinguïno -- and then the tinned-fish backlash began! Over at Eater, Amy McCarthy tries to convince us that "even the best tinned fish is just okay." Briny cockles grilled over a wood fire and then preserved by Güeyu Mar in buttery olive oil with habaneros are ... just OK? Huh.
Well, don't tell that to the people at the tomato farm in Pennsylvania who sell Güeyu Mar cans among many others. They've reportedly got the world's largest selection of tinned fish. Esra Erol of Foobooz has the details in Philadelphia Magazine.
Oh, and another person I'd suggest you not tell is Peter Zaremba, the lead singer of the Fleshtones. In this Instagram post from a canned-sardine emporium in Lisbon, it looks as if the small shiny fish have asked him to serve as their monarch. Long live the Sardine King!

China’s Economic Outlook: Pep Talks Up Top, Gloom on the Ground

SHANGHAI — To the residents and business owners of Chedun, a working-class neighborhood in the southwestern outskirts of Shanghai, the signs of an anemic economy are all around. The factories that once drew workers from around the country have moved away. Those that remain have slashed wages. Around the affordable eateries and motley shops where workers once crowded, employees eagerly latch onto anyone passing by.
“No one has money now, it’s obvious,” Cherry Qian, 25, said as she sat inside the electronics store she manages, which on Sunday afternoon had seen only one customer.
But there’s one place the downturn isn’t as obvious: in the government’s account of it.
A gulf has emerged between the Chinese economy as many Chinese are experiencing it, and Beijing’s narrative of it — and that gulf is only widening. For many ordinary Chinese, one of the worst economic slowdowns the country has faced in decades has translated into widespread pessimism and resignation. But state media and officials continue to declare that any challenges are blips.
Concerns about the economy, propaganda outlets have insisted, have been inflated by Western politicians and media outlets engaged in “cognitive warfare.” One social media account backed by China’s state broadcaster released a video that purported to investigate how foreign news outlets had cherry-picked statistics that predicted higher economic growth, just so they could later say China fell short. “At the end of the day, they are fated to be slapped in the face by reality,” a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said this month about the purported Western naysayers.
When the reality has proved too inconvenient, another approach has simply been to conceal it, as when Beijing this month stopped publishing the youth unemployment rate, which had been at a record high. The decision was widely mocked by Chinese social media users, who joked that the government had finally landed on an effective fix.
Differing official and on-the-ground narratives are hardly new in China, with its tightly controlled censorship apparatus. But the contrast is especially stark now, when the public’s gloom is so widespread, from the wealthy elite to factory workers.
A housing crisis has left many middle-class Chinese who poured their life savings into apartments reeling. Government crackdowns on various white-collar sectors, from education to technology, have spurred layoffs at major corporations. Foreign companies have pulled back from investments in China, leading to less work for factories, plunging paychecks for workers and falling consumer demand.
“I tried many times and just couldn’t find one I wanted,” Zhu Xunyang, 19, said of his search for a summer job at a factory in Chedun while home from university. Either the salary was too low, or the factories didn’t want him, he said.
“So I kind of wanted to just give up,” he said as he played games on his phone in the metalware shop his parents run. “And I did.”
Many skeptical or outright scornful comments about the economy on social media have escaped the censors, perhaps because they are so common.
“That sense of insecurity is almost universally shared within China now, across all walks of life,” said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong. “And that is why the government has been using all the official media and all other tools to convey a positive, optimistic message.”
The malaise is especially striking compared with the optimism many Chinese felt earlier this year, after Beijing finally abandoned coronavirus restrictions that for three years had left many people unable to leave home and unwilling to spend.
Qian, the electronics store manager, had hoped to buy a new car before her wedding later this year. But after seeing how business had flagged — she saw around 20 customers a day last year, she said — she abandoned that idea.
“It’s to prevent risk,” she said. “Before, you could buy a house as an investment. Now, nobody dares buy a house, or to casually buy anything big.”
A few blocks away, Zhang Jiaojuan and her husband were wondering whether people would venture to buy anything small either as they mixed chives and meat for orders that had yet to materialize at their dumpling store.
They had not planned to be entrepreneurs: Last year, they worked at an auto parts factory, earning between $800 and $1,000 a month, about the average per capita income in Shanghai. But this spring, wages fell to about $550, so low that the couple decided they might as well try to start their own business. They invested their life savings of about $27,000, thinking of the lively crowds that had filled the cramped storefronts hawking noodles, spicy duck necks and roast meat in the pre-pandemic years.
“And then we found out business is bad here, too,” said Zhang’s husband, who gave only his surname, Xue.
“People don’t spend money like they did before the pandemic, where they’d buy whatever they want,” Zhang said, as their teenage son slouched at one of the empty tables, playing with his phone.
They had cut back on their own spending, too. Xue said he had essentially stopped buying fruit, limiting himself to staples and vegetables. “We thought if we just got through those three years, and worked hard, there would definitely be hope,” he said. “And then it turned out that when the pandemic ended, things just got worse.”
Officials have acknowledged that the economy is facing new challenges, describing the recovery as “wavelike” while maintaining that the overall outlook is positive. But the remedies they have offered are unlikely to be effective, economists said.
Despite urging consumers to spend more, the government has rejected the idea of cash handouts to households, calling it too costly. It has brandished tax incentives for purchases of new homes, even as it has continued to erode the already weak social safety net that makes many Chinese leery of big purchases.
On Monday, the Ministry of Finance halved the tax on stock transactions, in an attempt to boost investor confidence. But that would not remedy how unwilling people are to buy stocks in the first place, given a lack of faith that they would grow in value, said Chen: “When the future is so uncertain, then it does not matter what kind of transaction costs you charge.”
“Detachment” between the top leadership and the reality of many Chinese, he added, “is clearly there.”
The government’s blame of external forces for the slowdown does have supporters. Wang Ainian, a barber in Chedun, pointed to news reports about the trade war with the United States and Japanese restrictions on the export of computing chips, when asked why business had slowed at local factories.
The economic pain has also been spread unevenly across the country. The wealthy, more insulated from uncertainties, continue to spend on luxury goods. Many malls and train stations are bustling again, though most shoppers and travelers are spending less and choosing cheaper destinations. Among some lower-income Chinese, familiarity with hardship has also blunted the pessimism of the recent downturn.
But even for Wang, no matter who is responsible for the economic pain, he had little hope that it would reverse itself soon. He was seeing only about two-thirds of the customers that he had the year before, and half of pre-pandemic levels. And that was in a world-class city like Shanghai, not his hometown in inland Anhui province.
“Shanghai is a place people dream of, and the population was always growing,” he said of Chedun. “But now it’s not.”
For others, the official explanations hardly register. A few blocks away, a 33-year-old clothing shop owner who gave her surname, Tang, said she did not pay attention to news about the economy. But she did spend a lot of time on Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social media platform similar to Instagram, where she tried to collect business tips from other clothing store owners. Most of the posts from them, though, were lamenting how bad their own business was.

In the middle of an academic year, with no warning, teachers were forced to confront the new, alien-seeming technology, which allowed students to write college-level essays, solve challenging problem sets and ace standardized tests.
Some schools responded -- unwisely, I argued at the time -- by banning ChatGPT and tools like it. But those bans didn't work, in part because students could simply use the tools on their phones and home computers. And as the year went on, many of the schools that restricted the use of generative A.I. -- as the category that includes ChatGPT, Bing, Bard and other tools is called -- quietly rolled back their bans.
Ahead of this school year, I talked with numerous K-12 teachers, school administrators and university faculty members about their thoughts on A.I. now. There is a lot of confusion and panic, but also a fair bit of curiosity and excitement. Mainly, educators want to know: How do we actually use this stuff to help students learn, rather than just try to catch them cheating?
I'm a tech columnist, not a teacher, and I don't have all the answers, especially when it comes to the long-term effects of A.I. on education. But I can offer some basic, short-term advice for schools trying to figure out how to handle generative A.I. this fall.
First, I encourage educators -- especially in high schools and colleges -- to assume that 100 percent of their students are using ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools on every assignment, in every subject, unless they're being physically supervised inside a school building.
At most schools, this won't be completely true. Some students won't use A.I. because they have moral qualms about it, because it's not helpful for their specific assignments, because they lack access to the tools or because they're afraid of getting caught.
But the assumption that everyone is using A.I. outside class may be closer to the truth than many educators realize. ("You have no idea how much we're using ChatGPT," read the title of a recent essay by a Columbia undergraduate in The Chronicle of Higher Education.) And it's a helpful shortcut for teachers trying to figure out how to adapt their teaching methods. Why would you assign a take-home exam, or an essay on "Jane Eyre," if everyone in class -- except, perhaps, the most strait-laced rule followers -- will use A.I. to finish it? Why wouldn't you switch to proctored exams, blue-book essays and in-class group work, if you knew that ChatGPT was as ubiquitous as Instagram and Snapchat among your students?
Second, schools should stop relying on A.I. detector programs to catch cheaters. There are dozens of these tools on the market now, all claiming to spot writing that was generated with A.I., and none of them work reliably well. They generate lots of false positives, and can be easily fooled by techniques like paraphrasing. Don't believe me? Ask OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, which discontinued its A.I. writing detector this year because of a "low rate of accuracy."
It's possible that in the future, A.I. companies may be able to label their models' outputs to make them easier to spot -- a practice known as "watermarking" -- or that better A.I. detection tools may emerge. But for now, most A.I. text should be considered undetectable, and schools should spend their time (and technology budgets) elsewhere.
My third piece of advice -- and the one that may get me the most angry emails from teachers -- is that teachers should focus less on warning students about the shortcomings of generative A.I. than on figuring out what the technology does well.
Last year, many schools tried to scare students away from using A.I. by telling them that tools like ChatGPT are unreliable, prone to spitting out nonsensical answers and generic-sounding prose. These criticisms, while true of early A.I. chatbots, are less true of today's upgraded models, and clever students are figuring out how to get better results by giving the models more sophisticated prompts.
As a result, students at many schools are racing ahead of their instructors when it comes to understanding what generative A.I. can do, if used correctly. And the warnings about flawed A.I. systems issued last year may ring hollow this year, now that GPT-4 is capable of getting passing grades at Harvard.
Alex Kotran, the chief executive of the AI Education Project, a nonprofit that helps schools adopt A.I., told me that teachers needed to spend time using generative A.I. themselves to appreciate how useful it could be -- and how quickly it was improving.
"For most people, ChatGPT is still a party trick," he said. "If you don't really appreciate how profound of a tool this is, you're not going to take all the other steps that are going to be required."
There are resources for educators who want to bone up on A.I. in a hurry. Mr. Kotran's organization has a number of A.I.-focused lesson plans available for teachers, as does the International Society for Technology in Education. Some teachers have also begun assembling recommendations for their peers, such as a website made by faculty at Gettysburg College that provides practical advice on generative A.I. for professors.
In my experience, though, there is no substitute for hands-on experience. So I'd advise teachers to start experimenting with ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools themselves, with the goal of getting as fluent in the technology as many of their students already are.
My last piece of advice for schools that are flummoxed by generative A.I. is this: Treat this year -- the first full academic year of the post-ChatGPT era -- as a learning experience, and don't expect to get everything right.
There are many ways A.I. could reshape the classroom. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, thinks the technology will lead more teachers to adopt a "flipped classroom" -- having students learn material outside class and practice it in class -- which has the advantage of being more resistant to A.I. cheating. Other educators I spoke with said they were experimenting with turning generative A.I. into a classroom collaborator, or a way for students to practice their skills at home with the help of a personalized A.I. tutor.
Some of these experiments won't work. Some will. That's OK. We're all still adjusting to this strange new technology in our midst, and the occasional stumble is to be expected.
But students need guidance when it comes to generative A.I., and schools that treat it as a passing fad -- or an enemy to be vanquished -- will miss an opportunity to help them.
"A lot of stuff's going to break," Mr. Mollick said. "And so we have to decide what we're doing, rather than fighting a retreat against the A.I."

Hip-Hop, Weights and Lots of Ice Cream: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Denzel Rodriguez, a 21-year-old from Harlem, works every summer at a local ice cream shop in between TV and film gigs.
Denzel Rodriguez has mastered the ice cream scoop.
"The flick of the wrist is important," said Mr. Rodriguez, 21, who goes by Zel. "You also want to wet the scooper. And once the ice cream is in the cup or cone, give it a tap with the scooper to make sure it's a perfect circle."
This is his third summer practicing his technique, working May to September at the family-owned scoop shop Sugar Hill Creamery in Harlem. In his free time he also writes songs, but his true passion is acting. He has appeared in several television shows, including CBS's "Blue Bloods," and a film released in April called "Showing Up," starring Michelle Williams, Hong Chau and André 3000. "My character was there to spark up some fun," he said.
Mr. Rodriguez, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Honduras, grew up in public housing. "I've seen the bad and good in this neighborhood," he said. "That's taught me that life isn't about your environment, and your environment doesn't define who you are. What you do and your actions define who you are."
That thinking, he said, has pushed him to work harder on his creative pursuits and "surpass what society expects me to be."
Mr. Rodriguez lives in West Harlem with his parents, Toribia Rodriguez, 56, a home attendant, and Saul Rodriguez, 56, a maintenance worker, and his 28-year-old sister Lillian.
MUSIC AND MOVEMENT I let my body wake me up around 9 or 10 a.m. I say a prayer about my day and thank God for everything. Tomorrow isn't always a promise, so I'm just thankful for today. For the next hour, I work out. I throw on some tunes: a hip-hop, R&B mix of 1,059 songs. I start off with weights, do some planks and end with cardio.
My parents are already up when I walk into the kitchen. My mom is nice enough to make me a hot green tea. She's usually cooking, or she's on the couch next to my dad, who is watching soccer while music is playing. They do a lot at the same time.
SEEKING INSPIRATION I chill in my room and scroll Instagram while listening to beats on YouTube from the TV. I don't have a specific artist or type of beat I listen to. I play whatever until something catches my ear. I try to apply lyrics to something that speaks to me. I'm writing songs on my phone. I'm storytelling. Sometimes it's my fantasies or what I want for the future. Sometimes I rap and speak my truth. I have 12 songs completed. It takes me a month to write one. I want to perfect it, but I'm learning to let the song be what it is because I have to put it out there. It's therapeutic and a way to express myself.
FAMILY LUNCH My mom made salmon and rice earlier, so I'll have that for lunch. I love living with my folks. New York is really expensive. I didn't go to college, but I'm working hard, and they know that, so they don't give me a hard time about moving out. I'm mostly in my room doing my thing, but it's comforting to have them here.
TV TIME I watch basketball highlights on YouTube or "The Shop: Uninterrupted," about young Black celebrities talking about life and their success, like Michael B. Jordan, LeBron James and Damson Idris. I just finished "Beef" on Netflix and "Swarm" on Amazon Prime. Now I'm watching "I'm a Virgo." It's a trippy show about a giant trying to navigate the world.
SHIFT STARTS By 3:40 p.m. I've showered and dressed for work. I take the M2 on 130th and 7th Avenue, or ride a Citi Bike, and head to work. July and August are prime time, where the store is hitting its peak. We have 32 flavors, plus four main ones: Brown Bombshell, blueberry cheesecake, vanilla and peach cobbler.
I go right into work mode. I can scoop for 50 to 60 people during a shift. From 4 to 6 p.m. we usually have more kids than adults. They've been to the pool or the park; they come in with friends or with their parents. Most people are from the hood, but we also get tourists who are visiting Harlem. The kids love adding gummy bears; the adults like colored sprinkles, which are a classic, or Oreos. If I'm not scooping, I'm doing online orders, cleaning and ringing up customers. Everyone does everything here.
NEXT WAVE I have a 30-minute break either at 6:30 or 7 p.m. I'll go to the corner store and get a turkey, bacon, egg and Cheddar cheese sandwich. This is the post-dinner crowd. Families come in. Online orders become intense. A line forms, which can go from inside to outside. The longest line I've seen happened during the pandemic: It went around the corner and up the block. We sell more brownie sundaes during this time, or people get pints to go so they can eat it after dinner at home or save it for the week.
EVENING RUSH From 8 to 10 p.m. the line gets bigger and more online orders come in, because people want ice cream before we close. We limit tastes to two, because we are so busy. My favorite is seeing repeat customers or when people ask me my name, because that means I did a good job or they like how I approached them. I make their scoop with love, as if I'm making it for myself.
I hit a wall at 9:30 p.m. but push through. At 10 p.m. the closed sign goes up. Someone is always trying to get ice cream after we close. I offer them a pint, and if we didn't put away the scoopers, I'll give them a scoop.
CLOSING UP We clean up until 10:45 p.m. I walk home because it's summer and nice outside. At home I visit my friends Eric and Siah, who live in my building on the ninth floor but in separate apartments. We play NBA 2K, a basketball video game, where we are on the court playing against each other. Then we listen to beats and rap freestyle.
By 12:30 or 1 a.m. I'm back home. My parents are knocked out in their bedroom. I shower and watch some anime on YouTube. Right now its Netflix's "Naruto," which is about a young ninja hoping to be accepted by his friends and trying to be a leader of his village. I fall asleep watching that.

Berkshires Dream House Takes Some Work: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Keeping that promise turned out to be harder than she expected.
If you don't try, you'll never know what's possible. That's the philosophy Tracy Crawford adopted when she set out to buy and renovate her dream home.
For seven years, Ms. Crawford had lived in an adequate house in Pittsfield, Mass., with her husband, Craig Crawford, and children, Riley, now 18, and Maggie, 14. But whenever they drove into the city center, they passed a 1938 house that was impressively large -- 5,500 square feet, it turned out -- on a bucolic six-acre property with a barn.
"I was always like, 'Oh, there's my dream house,"' said Ms. Crawford, 54, the owner of Evergreen Home Real Estate. "Maybe one day."
That day seemed to arrive in September 2017 when the house, which was owned by a bank, was listed for sale. But the asking price of $ 1.3 million was too high, so Ms. Crawford didn't pursue it.
A year later, it was still on the market, and the price had been gradually reduced to about $ 1 million. That's when they began thinking about making an offer. Suspecting that the bank would want to be rid of it, the couple bid the most they were willing to pay: $ 736,000.
It was a long shot, but worth a try. "I said to Craig, 'We just need to make an offer, and if they take it, we're going to do this,"' Ms. Crawford said.
She also made her husband another promise: If they did buy it, they wouldn't need to renovate. Mr. Crawford, 53, the founder of Cadence Effects, a visual-effects company that has worked on movies and TV shows like "The Whale" and "Game of Thrones," agreed.
"We both said, 'If it's meant to be, they will accept it,"' Ms. Crawford said. "Sure enough, they did."
After closing in June 2019, Ms. Crawford was happy, but it didn't take her long to start thinking about how she could improve the property, despite the promise she had made her husband.
It began with the two-story barn. The upstairs was an art studio, but Ms. Crawford decided to transform it into an apartment. "I thought, let's just redo it and have it for guests," she said.
The backyard was densely wooded, so the couple had much of it cleared to open up views and make way for a new pool and pool house. That was how they realized the rooms along the back of the main house weren't ideal. Previous renovations had left them small and dark, linked by a mazelike route.
To remedy the situation, they hired Pamela Sandler, a local architect. "There were many beautiful parts of the house, but they weren't cohesive," Ms. Sandler said.
To fix that, "we blew out the back," she said, a project that included demolishing a sunroom and part of the old kitchen to install an expanse of windows and sliding-glass doors that open to a new covered porch. She also changed the floor plan to create a generous mudroom and expanded kitchen.
With such a large project, Ms. Crawford began thinking she needed an interior designer, too. But who? Her favorite was Heidi Caillier, a Seattle-based designer who created traditional interiors with a modern twist that Ms. Crawford admired on Instagram.
She assumed that because Ms. Caillier lived on the other side of the country, she wouldn't be interested in the project. But the only way to know was to ask. When she did, she learned that Ms. Caillier had lived nearby as a child and was thrilled to be involved.
"Tracy's inspiration board was filled with pictures from my portfolio, which was so lovely," Ms. Caillier said. "The whole design feel for this house is Old World British with old Americana, with lots of antiques, vintage and pattern."
After working with Ms. Caillier over Zoom and email, the Crawfords moved into their barn apartment in September 2021 to allow Berkshire Construction & Logging to begin the interior overhaul.
The result was a home that looks almost as if it hasn't been changed in decades -- with a mudroom finished in floral Farrow & Ball wallpaper and wood floors painted in a diamond pattern; a living room wrapped in sage-colored paneling; and a dining room with scenic murals painted by James Mobley. The furnishings are a mix of antiques (think beaten-up Swedish cupboards), new pieces with patina (the kitchen island was made by Matthew Cox) and contemporary items (including the living room sofa and a painted puzzle artwork from BDDW).
The family moved back into the house in September 2022, while the finishing work continued, and the renovation was largely done just before the end of the year. In all, the cost was about $ 1.8 million. (Next month, the project will be featured in Ms. Caillier's book, "Memories of Home," published by Rizzoli.)
Although Ms. Crawford initially considered the house her forever home, the process was so rewarding, she said, that "I would do it all again -- I'm dying to work with Heidi again."

Full text: Best known internationally for her breakout performance in the 1959 film "Black Orpheus," she challenged racial stereotypes over a seven-decade career.
Léa Garcia, a pioneering actress who brought new visibility and respect to Black actors in Brazil after her breakout performance in the Academy Award-winning 1959 film "Black Orpheus," died on Aug. 15 in Gramado, a mountain resort town in southern Brazil. She was 90.
Her death, of cardiac complications, was confirmed by her family on her Instagram account. At her death, in a hospital, she was in Gramado to receive a lifetime achievement award at that town's film festival. Her son Marcelo Garcia, who was also her manager, accepted the honor in her place.
Over a prolific career that began in the 1950s, Ms. Garcia amassed more than 100 credits in theater, film and television, from her early years with an experimental Black theater group to her later prominence on television productions, like the popular 1976 telenovela "Escrava Isaura" ("Isaura: Slave Girl"), based on an 1875 novel by the abolitionist writer Bernardo Guimarães; it was seen in more than 80 countries.
Recounting her career in a 2022 interview with the Brazilian magazine Ela, Ms. Garcia said she felt blessed by her success. "I often say that the gods embraced me," she said. "Things always arrived for me without me running after them."
Still, laboring to change racial perceptions in the world of film and television involved tremendous perseverance and discipline. "Much more was demanded of us," she told Ela. "We had to arrive with the text on the tip of our tongue, always smelling good and elegant. Others could be wrong. We could not. We could play subservient characters, but we needed to show that we ourselves were not."
Léa Lucas Garcia de Aguiar was born on March 11, 1933, in Rio de Janeiro. Growing up, she was drawn to literature and aspired to be a writer. That changed one day in 1950.
"I was on my way to pick up my grandmother to take her to the movies," she recalled, "when someone came up to me and asked, 'Would you like to work in theater?"'
The voice belonged to Abdias do Nascimento, the writer, artist and Pan-Africanist activist who created Teatro Experimental do Negro (TEN), a Rio-based group that aimed to promote the appreciation of Afro-Brazilian culture. (The two would become a couple and had two children together.) Ms. Garcia made her stage debut in 1952 in Mr. Nascimento's play "Rapsódia Negra" ("Black Rhapsody").
As the decade drew to a close, she took her career to a new level of international recognition when she was cast in the French director Marcel Camus's "Black Orpheus," a retelling of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice adapted to the frenzy of Rio's carnival and featuring music by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfá. It won the Oscar for best foreign-language film in 1960.
With its lush exuberance, the film was anything but classical in feel. "It really is not the two lovers that are the focus of interest in this film; it is the music, the movement, the storm of color," Bosley Crowther wrote in a review in The New York Times.
Even in a supporting role, Ms. Garcia showed an ability to beguile. "Léa Garcia," Mr. Crowther wrote, "is especially provoking as the loose-limbed cousin of the soft Eurydice."
Among her other notable films was "Ganga Zumba," the debut feature by Carlos Diegues, a pioneer in Brazil's reformist Cinema Novo movement, which was made in 1963 but not released until 1972. She brought power and complexity to the character of Cipriana, the lover of the title character, who escapes a sugar plantation in the 17th century to lead Quilombo dos Palmares, a haven for other fugitives from slavery.
"It's not shameful to be a slave," Ms. Garcia often said, according to family members. "It's shameful to be a colonizer."
The pace of her career scarcely slowed over the years; she spent decades as a staple of Brazilian soap operas like "O Clone" ("The Clone"), "Anjo Mau" ("Evil Angel"), "Xica da Silva" and "Marina," and was seen on other TV series as well.
Even in her 80s, Ms. Garcia remained productive. She starred in the drama series "Baile de Máscaras" in 2019 and returned to the stage in 2022 in the play "A Vida Não é Justa" ("Life Is Not Fair"), in which she played three characters and explored themes of diversity, equality, justice and relationships.
Complete information on her survivors was not immediately available.
In the Ela interview, Ms. Garcia discussed her hopes for her great-great-granddaughter, who was 7 months old at the time. "I hope for a fair and egalitarian country that respects diversities," she said. "That's what I want, and much more."

In Foreign Land, Far Away From Home, Adams Has Little Trouble Being Himself: [National Desk]

Full text: The mayor was peak Eric Adams on his trip, keeping a frenzied schedule, checking out police drones, enjoying Tel Aviv's nightlife and shaking off the haters.
When Mayor Eric Adams of New York City faces the familiar question about why he goes out on the town so often, he offers a standard defense: He says his enthusiastic presence at nightclubs and restaurants helps boost a multibillion dollar industry.
Apparently the mayor chose to follow a similar practice on his trip to Israel.
On a whirlwind three-day visit, Mr. Adams dined at the Whiskey Bar and Museum in Tel Aviv, a sleek restaurant with more than 1,000 types of whiskey. He danced and banged a drum at Jerusalem's rowdy Mahane Yehuda Market. He was photographed with the son of an Israeli billionaire as he enjoyed Tel Aviv's buzzing nightlife scene.
Mr. Adams may have been thousands of miles away from home, but was still very much himself: high energy, highly quotable, spiritual, ideologically to the right of many Democrats in his party, wary of the press, fond of police drone demonstrations and foremost a foodie.
The trip gave Mr. Adams some distance from a series of pressing challenges in New York City, allowing him to focus on preferred topics, like his ties to the Jewish community, public safety and courting business.
Much of his schedule was filled with events not open to journalists, even though members of the City Hall press corps were in Israel to cover the mayor. The names of those he met at private events were typically not disclosed, and he held only two media briefings, neither of them in person.
One moment that unintentionally went viral was his visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where he was photographed with his hand pressed to the wall, his right wrist adorned with a beaded bracelet that spells out "HUSTLE."
Even though Mr. Adams has worn the bracelet since at least November 2021, it was seen as a surprising, if jarring, juxtaposition: a holy site dating back more than 2,000 years alongside a modern slogan that the mayor lives by.
Other facets of the mayor's personality were on display during the trip. Mr. Adams, a health enthusiast who wrote a book about his plant-based diet, grilled a chef about the fat, carb and sugar contents of the vegan burgers and kebabs he was presented during his meeting with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. At a lunch to showcase Israeli food companies, he appeared to nibble on a bite of grouper before realizing that it was, in fact, fish -- part of a pattern of straying from his mostly vegan diet.
On Wednesday night in Tel Aviv, the mayor dined with Asaf Zamir, a former Israeli consul general in New York at whose wedding Mr. Adams officiated in June. Mr. Zamir thanked Mr. Adams on Instagram for visiting the city's nightlife.
The mayor kept his order simple: a plain salad with a sweet potato, without salt or oil, Mr. Zamir said. They discussed many topics, he said, including pollution, crime, outdoor dining and affordable housing.
Mr. Adams, a former police officer, delighted in a demonstration of police technology at Israel's National Police Academy that included two officers riding a BMW motorcycle holding a large gun in the air, and a futuristic drone that Mr. Adams said was superior to New York's technology.
"One thing that really caught my eye was utilizing motorcycles and drones together, something that we have not been using in the city to immediately get to your location," Mr. Adams said.
Still, even as he celebrated Israel's security apparatus, Mr. Adams conceded that some tactics would not be palatable back home: "Some countries, Israel and others, use technology that just will not fit in America's belief on privacy," he said.
Mr. Adams has said that he sleeps only four hours a night, and that seemed to be the case in Israel, where he kept a relentless schedule. The mayor was whisked around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in a phalanx of black SUVs -- similar to the way he moves about New York City. Mr. Adams's new deputy mayor for communications, Fabien Levy, declined to say whether the mayor took either city's light rail system.
Mr. Levy was more direct in his response to the city comptroller, Brad Lander, who questioned the mayor's decision not to visit Palestinian families in the West Bank.
"Since you asked, the mayor met with Palestinians, Ethiopian Jews, organizers in the protest movement and more over the last two days," Mr. Levy responded on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.
In Israel, the mayor continued his practice of promoting private companies, including F2 Venture Capital, a venture capital firm that works in artificial intelligence and big data; Aleph Farms, a food technology company that is preparing to seek regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and Egg'n'Up, a start-up that makes plant-based eggs.
He also attended a "business leaders round table" hosted by the Bank of Israel; Mr. Levy would not provide a list of the attendees.
Wherever the mayor goes, the powerful and wealthy want to be near him. On his night out in Tel Aviv, Mr. Adams was photographed with Gil Ofer, the son of the Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer, and Said Abulafia, a member of another wealthy family.
By appearing with the prime minister, Mr. Adams aligned himself with more conservative Democrats and Netanyahu loyalists back home. Some left-leaning Jewish groups urged him to challenge Mr. Netanyahu during their meeting over his efforts to weaken the judicial system, but Mr. Adams said he did not want to get involved.
And the mayor, as always, provided intriguing commentary. Some of his quotes have become memes, such as "my haters become my waiters when I sit down at the table of success," while others raise more questions than they answer.
Mr. Adams has said that he wanted to retire in Israel, possibly in the Golan Heights, a fertile plateau beside the Sea of Galilee that Israel annexed unilaterally but Syria still claims. When a reporter asked him in Israel if he did indeed plan to retire there, the mayor said that it was on a short list of eight places, along with Senegal and Nigeria and "a few more I want to keep secret so the press won't be able to find me when I retire."
Before leaving town, Mr. Adams told tech leaders that the country could overcome its current challenges, using a metaphor that was open to interpretation.
"Israel is a unicorn," he told them.

Responding to Diplomatic Outrage, Denmark Moves to Ban Quran Burnings: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Danish and Swedish authorities have struggled to balance free speech with growing anger that security officials say has elevated the risk of terrorist attacks.
Denmark's government said on Friday that it would move to criminalize the public mistreatment of religious objects, setting aside free-speech concerns with what one minister called a "targeted intervention" after a spate of public Quran desecrations caused furors in many Muslim-majority countries.
Those found guilty of mistreating an object with major religious significance could be fined or sentenced to up to two years in prison, according to a draft of a bill published by the Danish Justice Ministry. Danish coalition officials said they could enact the policy as soon as the end of the year if it is approved by Parliament.
Both Denmark and neighboring Sweden have struggled to balance respect for free expression with the diplomatic fallout of the desecrations. Governments in many Muslim-majority countries have issued withering condemnations, and authorities in both countries have said that the risk of terrorist attacks has risen in recent months, posing a threat to national security.
After a small group of Danish nationalists filmed themselves burning what they said was a Quran late last month, hundreds of Iraqi protesters tried to storm Denmark's embassy in Baghdad before security forces dispersed them. On Sunday, the Iranian authorities summoned Danish and Swedish diplomats to chastise them over another series of desecrations in both countries.
Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told reporters that there had been more than 170 demonstrations, including some with Quran burnings, in front of the embassies of Muslim-majority countries and elsewhere in Denmark over the past month. The protests, which are generally small, often denounce Islam and Muslim immigration.
"This has put Denmark in a difficult foreign-policy situation," Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, the country's deputy prime minister, said on Friday. "And the government cannot just sit and listen to that."
Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard characterized the proposal as a "targeted invention" against Quran burnings that "damage the security of Danes both abroad and at home." Presenting the measure on Friday, Mr. Hummelgaard pledged that a "very broad framework" for freedom of expression would remain in Denmark.
He said the proposed law would not apply to clothing or satirical drawings, for example, and would not constrain criticism of religion. "I think there are more civilized ways to express your opinions than by burning things down," he said.
Danish critics immediately slammed the bill as an assault on the country's historically strong protections for free speech and as a capitulation to violence. The Liberal Alliance, which holds 14 of 179 seats in Parliament, said it was "a sad day for Danes and a good day for extremists."
"Congratulations, Al Qaeda and Co.," the party said on Instagram.
Jacob Kaarsbo, an analyst at Think Tank Europa in Copenhagen, called the bill "an effort to reach out to the Muslim mainstream" and tamp down tensions by showing Muslim-majority countries that Denmark was taking the problem seriously.
"It's ultimately very few people that are behind this, but they're having an outsized impact," Mr. Kaarsbo said, referring to the Quran desecrations.
This is far from Denmark's first brush with controversy surrounding the boundaries of free speech and Islam. In 2005, a Danish newspaper published several cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad that many Muslims considered blasphemous and that set off violent protests and attacks.
Far-right Scandinavian provocateurs have burned the Quran occasionally for years to signal their opposition to Muslim immigration into countries like Denmark. But tensions this year began to rise after Rasmus Paludan, a right-wing nationalist and dual citizen of Sweden and Denmark, set a copy of the Quran ablaze in January.
In late June, Salwan Momika, an Iraqi immigrant to Sweden, burned a Quran outside a mosque in Stockholm. A Muslim man was later granted a permit to burn a Torah and a Bible outside the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm but did not follow through. He later told reporters that his intention had been not to burn the scriptures but to underscore the abhorrent nature of such acts.
The governments of many Muslim countries have fiercely denounced Denmark and Sweden for allowing the burning of Qurans. Both governments have repeatedly condemned the desecrations but said they were constrained by free-speech laws.
Sweden, which hopes to join NATO, fears that the controversy could delay its membership. Turkey's foreign minister said last month that Stockholm's inability to "prevent provocations" had raised questions about Sweden's credentials for membership.
In mid-July, hundreds of people stormed the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad and set parts of it on fire over the Swedish government's decision to allow the desecrations. Iraq also expelled the Swedish ambassador and directed his Iraqi counterpart to withdraw from the Iraqi Embassy in Stockholm.
Last month, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden described the security situation there as the most serious since World War II. This month, Sweden's domestic security agency raised its terrorism threat level to "high," the second-most severe designation in a five-point scale.

Toward a Better World, One Berry at a Time: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A pot of birch sap simmered on Eva Gunnare's stove. It was an early morning in May in Jokkmokk, a small Swedish town in the Arctic Circle, and outside the snow was melting. On the table sat a plate of cookies made with dried bilberries, a native fruit that Ms. Gunnare had foraged the previous season.
"Most Swedish people eat blueberries imported from abroad," she said, pouring some sap into a small shot glass. "They do not know we have these delicious bilberries in our own backyard."
For over a decade, Ms. Gunnare, a 56-year-old Swedish woman, has been trying to restore people's relationship with nature by teaching them how to forage. Through her lessons on picking wild herbs, identifying edible plants and making dandelion honey, among many others, she aims to help locals and foreign visitors alike better understand nature.
Her approach differs from other tourist operators in the region, who often focus on outdoor expeditions such as trekking or skimobiling. These, Ms. Gunnare believes, do not always help people better understand or respect their environment.
"I don't want people to run through nature," she said. "I want them to crawl."
Jokkmokk, with a population of about 3,000 people, attracts domestic and foreign tourists year-round. During winter, tens of thousands of visitors arrive for the Winter Market, a 400-year-old event that celebrates the Sámi, the Indigenous people of northern Scandinavia, Finland and western Russia. Others are drawn by the promise of seeing the northern lights, or to ski and dog sled. In the summer, many tourists come to trek and canoe through national parks.
Part of the region's appeal is its pristine nature. Sometimes called "Europe's last wilderness," it is home to some of the last untouched old-growth forests on the continent.
"People come here to experience something wild and remote, but many people just rush through it," Ms. Gunnare said. "They don't stop to notice the flora and fauna. They don't always see that some of it is not doing too well."
Forests cover about 70 percent of land in Sweden. But primary forests, or old-growth forests, which consist of native tree species that are undisturbed by human activity, have largely been cut down. Now, the country's forests consist mostly of tree plantations used for logging, which can have devastating environmental impacts. These plantations, usually monocultures, are far more vulnerable to disease and natural disasters than old-growth forests. They also store less carbon.
And the problem is only getting worse. Between 2003 and 2019, Sweden's remaining old-growth forests were logged at a rate of 1.4 percent per year. If those logging rates continue, the last remaining old-growth forests would be lost in about 50 years, according to some estimates.
Many tourists who travel through the region, however, can't tell an old-growth forest and a tree plantation apart. "I took a journalist up here a few years ago and asked him what he saw," said Nila Jannok, a local Sámi reindeer herder. "Where he saw forest, I saw destruction."
This is precisely the knowledge gap Ms. Gunnare seeks to address. Many of the edible plants she forages for can only grow in primary forests, which harbor larger numbers of species, and where plants and fungi, such as mushrooms, can thrive. By showing tourists the abundance of what can grow in a primary forest, she teaches them why biodiversity is necessary to sustain a healthy environment.
Originally from Stockholm, Ms. Gunnare moved north in 1987 to Kvikkjokk, a village about 75 miles from Jokkmokk, to work at a hiking lodge. She married a Sámi herder, and together they raised their child in Jokkmokk. Over the years, Ms. Gunnare worked various jobs in tourism. But in 2009, she felt a calling to engage with tourists, and nature, differently.
"It's wonderful to hike or ski through this land," she said. "But to really know it, you have to understand its flora and fauna, to see how all of it is connected."
In 2009, Gunnare enrolled in a culinary class at the Sámi Education Center in Jokkmokk. She describes the course as one of the biggest turning points in her life. In the summer, when the Arctic sky was bright, she would stay out foraging until midnight and come home covered in mosquito bites, with splinters in her fingers and toes. "I really felt this would be my way to get people to care about nature," she said.
Two years later, she started her own company, the Essense of Lapland, and she has been giving foraging tours ever since.
In Sweden, foraging has long been an important culinary and cultural practice. For the Sámi, foraged foods -- including herbs, roots and lingonberries -- are at the heart of their diet. In the rest of the country, non-Indigenous Swedes have been foraging since at least 1867, when a famine forced many to use lichen to make bark bread.
Over the past two decades, however, interest in foraging globally has grown significantly. In the mid-2000s, foraging saw a revival with the rise of New Nordic cuisine, inspired by the famous Danish restaurant Noma, which puts local, seasonal and foraged ingredients at the heart of dishes. In recent years, a wave of foraging influencers has emerged; on TikTok, the hashtag #foragingtiktok has over 160 million views. Foraging educators say they have seen an explosion of interest in their work.
But even amid this renewed interest in foraging, many people remain disconnected from the production of their food. One survey found that 41 percent of Americans never or rarely seek information about where or how their food was grown. As people become more urbanized, increasingly eating nonseasonal and imported food, their connection with nature is fraying.
"So many of us have become estranged from our own flora and fauna," Ms. Gunnare said. "We've come to fear it."
Reconnecting people with nature -- and, in turn, raising their awareness about the forces that threaten it -- is what motivates Ms. Gunnare's work. "I'm not trying to turn everyone into a forager like me," she explained. "I'm trying to get them to understand it, to develop a relationship with it."
"It's a simple but powerful thought," she said, adding: "The more people know their environment, the more inclined they will feel to protect it."

Yale's Campus Police Send Terrifying Message to Incoming Students: [National Desk]

Full text: There was anger after the campus police union -- which is renegotiating a contract -- shared a safety flier with a picture of the Grim Reaper on it.
Andre Fa'aoso, an incoming first-year student at Yale, has been in the United States for 12 days. He arrived from New Zealand on his own, three suitcases in tow.
As he pulled his luggage through downtown New Haven, Conn., a woman handed him a flier describing his new city as crime-ridden and dangerous. It listed alarming local crime statistics and instructed students to "remain on campus," "avoid public transportation" and "stay off the streets after 8 p.m." Illustrated with a picture of the Grim Reaper, the flier wished students an ominous "Good luck."
But perhaps most jarring was the source of the flier, listed plainly in its text: the union that represents Yale's own campus police.
In the days since the union distributed the "survival guide" leaflets, Yale administrators and police officials have been scrambling to calm first-year students and their parents.
Anthony Campbell, the chief of the Yale Police Department, said the leaflets wrongly painted New Haven as "a war zone."
"I am extremely hurt and sad and disgusted by the actions taken by the Yale Police Benevolent Association," the police union, said Mr. Campbell, who once led the New Haven Police Department. "I think it is divisive and destructive for any police officer to disparage the city in which they work."
The police union flier reported that "murders have doubled, burglaries are up 33 percent and motor vehicle thefts are up 56 percent," in the first seven months of the year.
The numbers are accurate. But Mayor Justin Elicker called them cherry-picked and misleading. He noted that violent crime has decreased by 29.2 percent since 2020. Although homicides are up, the number of shootings has come down.
"Overall, over the past three years or so, crime is down," he said, adding, "While the actual numbers may be accurate, they don't present the full picture of what's going on."
The fliers strongly resemble pamphlets that public safety officers handed out to travelers arriving in New York City in 1975.
"Welcome to Fear City," those fliers read, as unions representing public safety officers tried to fight layoffs.
Yale's police union is in contract negotiations, although its lawyer, Andrew Matthews, said the fliers were not a tactic in the talks.
Instead, he said, officers in the union were likely trying to raise awareness about crime in New Haven for some of its newest residents.
"I don't think there was an attempt to fearmonger or scare people," he said.
Mr. Matthews, a former officer with the Yale Police Department, said the union wanted its pamphlet to stand out amid the deluge of papers that first-year students would receive.
"And without a doubt," he said, "their pamphlet stands out."
The town-gown relationship has long been fraught between Yale, one of the world's most selective universities, where white students make up the largest demographic, and New Haven, which has long struggled with crime and poverty, and is majority Black and Hispanic.
Students and city residents talk about the Yale "bubble." Jay Gitlin, a history professor who teaches the popular course "Yale and America," called it "Fortress Yale." Articulating the longstanding town-gown mentality, he said: "New Haven is out there; Yale is in here."
Around campus on Thursday, few incoming Yale students appeared to accept the police union's message.
"I thought it was quite alarmist," said Mr. Fa'aoso, 18.
Brice June, an 18-year-old first-year student, said the flier was "tough" because he and his classmates were all in a new environment.
"Although New Haven can be a rough city, the contents on this flier are misleading," he said in an Instagram message, "especially for someone who's unfamiliar with the town."
The leaflets frightened some students, and scared some of their parents.
"To be presented with a flier that says that you're dropping your kids off in a dangerous place must have been really upsetting for some of the families," Mr. Elicker said.
Mike Lawlor, a professor at the University of New Haven who is also a New Haven police commissioner, said that New Haven's challenges mirror those of other American cities.
"If you're trying to paint a picture of crime out of control, it's not at all accurate," he said, adding that the crime rate is "lower than it was 10 to 15 to 20 years ago, that's for sure."
Mr. Campbell, Yale's police chief, said the fliers could do harm to campus safety, and to the department's reputation.
"When you see, from the day you're moving in, that the police department doesn't have its house in order, then you start saying: 'Well, can I even count on you to tell me the truth and to really keep me safe?"' he said.

Full text: He arrives as the Queens museum redesigns its core exhibition to include more nods to video games and social media.
As the Museum of the Moving Image begins the early stages of redesigning its core exhibition to entice visitors back into its futuristic building in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, its trustees have tapped a nonprofit executive to lead the way.
On Thursday, the museum announced that Aziz Isham would become its next director, filling the shoes of Carl Goodman, who recently left after nearly 12 years in the role. Isham, who does not have museum experience, has worked as a film producer and helped start the television program at BRIC, an arts organization in Brooklyn.
Isham will begin at the museum in October after leaving his current job as executive director of the arts nonprofit Twenty Summers.
"I can't think of a more relevant New York institution and a better place to make sense of the present and figure out our future," Isham, 45, said. "As the world of the moving image transforms, we've got this opportunity to redesign how the museum engages with the public."
When the Museum of the Moving Image opened in 1988, its mission seemed obvious. The institution was built upon the former grounds of a Paramount studio where the Marx Brothers sometimes filmed. The traditional definition of "moving images" largely meant television and movies, so the museum built its collection of 130,000 objects to explain how people designed within these artistic media.
During an interview, Isham suggested that the definition had changed with the rise of video games, social media and artificial intelligence.
"The moving image is how we define our time and wrestling with our future," he said.
The museum's board is fully behind his vision, according to Ivan Lustig, who works in private equity and one of the organization's chairmen. He said the museum would probably need to increase its $ 7.9 million budget to add staff members and capabilities that might fulfill Isham's vision. And though planning is still preliminary, Lustig has been brainstorming what shape the new core exhibition might take.
"If you have been to the second floor, you have seen a lot of televisions and cameras," he said. "Compared to their importance today, we can tell that story in 20 to 35 percent of the space that is there and introduce other digital images."
That is not to say that the museum is behind on the times; it has a reputation for creating significant exhibitions around video games and artificial intelligence ahead of its more academic peers.
"We have kept up with the exhibition technology, but the way it plays into our culture is not well told," Lustig said. "We don't really address TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. We do touch on historic electronic games, but they have advanced so much."
The challenge, according to Isham, is creating a museum that can anticipate the problems of tomorrow: "How do we not just tell the story of where we have been, but tell the story of where we are going?"

In Israel, Adams Has Swagger in His Step and ‘Hustle’ on His Sleeve

Full text: Enlarge this image.
TEL AVIV, Israel — When Mayor Eric Adams of New York City faces the familiar question about why he goes out on the town so often, he offers a standard defense: He says his enthusiastic presence at nightclubs and restaurants helps boost a multibillion-dollar industry.
Apparently, the mayor chose to follow a similar practice on his trip to Israel.
On a whirlwind three-day visit, Adams dined at the Whiskey Bar and Museum in Tel Aviv, a sleek restaurant with more than 1,000 types of whiskey. He danced and banged a drum at Jerusalem’s rowdy Mahane Yehuda Market. He was photographed with the son of an Israeli billionaire as he enjoyed Tel Aviv’s buzzing nightlife scene.
Adams may have been thousands of miles away from home but was still very much himself: high-energy, highly quotable, spiritual, ideologically to the right of many Democrats in his party, wary of the press, fond of police drone demonstrations and foremost a foodie.
The trip gave Adams some distance from a series of pressing challenges in New York City, allowing him to focus on preferred topics, like his ties to the Jewish community, public safety and courting business.
Much of his schedule was filled with events not open to journalists, even though members of the City Hall press corps were in Israel to cover the mayor. The names of those he met at private events were typically not disclosed, and he held only two media briefings, neither of them in person.
One moment that unintentionally went viral was his visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where he was photographed with his hand pressed to the wall, his right wrist adorned with a beaded bracelet that spells out “HUSTLE.”
Even though Adams has worn the bracelet since at least November 2021, it was seen as a surprising, if jarring, juxtaposition: a holy site dating back more than 2,000 years alongside a modern slogan that the mayor lives by.
Other facets of the mayor’s personality were on display during the trip. Adams, a health enthusiast who wrote a book about his plant-based diet, grilled a chef about the fat, carb and sugar contents of the vegan burgers and kebabs he was presented during his meeting with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. At a lunch to showcase Israeli food companies, he appeared to nibble on a bite of grouper before realizing that it was, in fact, fish — part of a pattern of straying from his mostly vegan diet.
On Wednesday night in Tel Aviv, the mayor dined with Asaf Zamir, a former Israeli consul general in New York at whose wedding Adams officiated in June. Zamir thanked Adams on Instagram for visiting the city’s nightlife.
The mayor kept his order simple: a plain salad with a sweet potato, without salt or oil, Zamir said. They discussed many topics, he said, including pollution, crime, outdoor dining and affordable housing.
Adams, a former police officer, delighted in a demonstration of police technology at Israel’s National Police Academy that included two officers riding a BMW motorcycle holding a large gun in the air and a futuristic drone that Adams said was superior to New York’s technology.
“One thing that really caught my eye was utilizing motorcycles and drones together, something that we have not been using in the city, to immediately get to your location,” Adams said.
Still, even as he celebrated Israel’s security apparatus, Adams conceded that some tactics would not be palatable back home: “Some countries, Israel and others, use technology that just will not fit in America’s belief on privacy,” he said.
Adams has said that he sleeps only four hours a night, and that seemed to be the case in Israel, where he kept a relentless schedule. The mayor was whisked around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in a phalanx of black SUVs — similar to the way he moves about New York City. Adams’ new deputy mayor for communications, Fabien Levy, declined to say whether the mayor took either city’s light rail system.
Levy was more direct in his response to the city comptroller, Brad Lander, who questioned the mayor’s decision not to visit Palestinian families in the West Bank.
“Since you asked, the mayor met with Palestinians, Ethiopian Jews, organizers in the protest movement and more over the last two days,” Levy responded on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.
In Israel, the mayor continued his practice of promoting private companies, including F2 Venture Capital, a venture capital firm that works in artificial intelligence and big data; Aleph Farms, a food technology company that is preparing to seek regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and Egg’n’Up, a startup that makes plant-based eggs.
He also attended a “business leaders roundtable” hosted by the Bank of Israel; Levy would not provide a list of the attendees.
Wherever the mayor goes, the powerful and wealthy want to be near him. On his night out in Tel Aviv, Adams was photographed with Gil Ofer, the son of Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer, and Said Abulafia, a member of another wealthy family.
By appearing with the prime minister, Adams aligned himself with more conservative Democrats and Netanyahu loyalists back home. Some left-leaning Jewish groups urged him to challenge Netanyahu during their meeting over his efforts to weaken the judicial system, but Adams said he did not want to get involved.
And the mayor, as always, provided intriguing commentary. Some of his quotes have become memes, such as, “My haters become my waiters when I sit down at the table of success,” while others raise more questions than they answer.
Adams has said that he wanted to retire in Israel, possibly in the Golan Heights, a fertile plateau beside the Sea of Galilee that Israel annexed unilaterally but Syria still claims. When a reporter asked him in Israel if he did indeed plan to retire there, the mayor said that it was on a shortlist of eight places, along with Senegal and Nigeria and “a few more I want to keep secret so the press won’t be able to find me when I retire.”
Before leaving town, Adams told tech leaders that the country could overcome its current challenges, using a metaphor that was open to interpretation.
“Israel is a unicorn,” he told them.

Trump Adds Heavy Hitter To Legal Team in Georgia: [National Desk]

Full text: Mr. Trump is hiring Steve Sadow, a veteran criminal defense lawyer in Atlanta who has taken on a number of high-profile cases.
Just before his visit to an Atlanta jail to be booked on 13 felony counts, Donald J. Trump has shaken up his Georgia legal defense team, adding Steve Sadow, a veteran criminal defense lawyer who has taken on a number of high-profile cases.
Mr. Sadow filed a document with the court on Thursday stating that he was now "lead counsel of record for Donald John Trump."
Mr. Trump's decision comes soon after one of his lawyers, Drew Findling, and his two other lawyers in the Georgia case, Jennifer Little and Marissa Goldberg, negotiated a $ 200,000 bond for Mr. Trump, who is one of 19 defendants in a sweeping racketeering indictment charging them with engaging in a "criminal enterprise" that sought to overturn Mr. Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia.
Mr. Findling is expected to be let go, according to a person familiar with the matter, while Ms. Little will be retained.
Mr. Trump, who is often dissatisfied with lawyers he hires, had been inquiring for several days about who else he could bring in, according to a person familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Trump's main concern, according to the person, was that he wanted a more "sophisticated" team.
Mr. Sadow said in a statement that Mr. Trump "should never have been indicted," adding, "He is innocent of all the charges brought against him."
"Prosecutions intended to advance or serve the ambitions and careers of political opponents of the president have no place in our justice system," he said.
The shake-up was first reported by ABC News.
Mr. Trump is expected to surrender on Thursday at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, where he is likely to be fingerprinted and photographed, as is usually done with all criminal defendants in the county. Supporters of Mr. Trump began arriving outside the jail early in the morning; by 9:30 a.m., dozens of people were there, carrying signs and shouting slogans.
Rick Hearn, 44, an Atlanta accountant, displayed a poster with an image of Mr. Trump next to one of Nelson Mandela, with the title "political prisoners."
"I feel like I needed to be a part of this," Mr. Hearn said, adding that "those in charge" need to know that they could not "take away our rights and get away with it."
The Georgia indictment, released last week, is the fourth criminal case against Mr. Trump to be filed this year. It targets not just him, but also an array of his allies, who are accused of engaging in election interference after the November 2020 vote. The defendants include Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer, and Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump's former White House chief of staff.
As of Thursday afternoon, more than half of the 19 defendants had been booked at the jail, including Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Meadows, and a cascade of legal maneuvering was underway. Three defendants are seeking to remove their cases to federal court: Mr. Meadows; Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official; and David Shafer, a former head of the Georgia Republican Party.
Another defendant, Kenneth Chesebro, filed a speedy-trial demand on Wednesday, which under Georgia law would require the trial for all 19 defendants to begin by Nov. 3 -- months earlier than prosecutors had sought.
On Thursday, the Fulton County district attorney, Fani T. Willis, filed a motion requesting that the trial start "for all 19 defendants" on Oct. 23. Mr. Trump then filed a response opposing the October trial date and noting that he would seek to sever his case from Mr. Chesebro's and that of any other defendant who seeks a speedy trial.
On Thursday afternoon, the presiding judge, Scott McAfee, approved the speedy-trial request, though he made clear that the new trial date applied only to Mr. Chesebro.
Still, given all the pretrial wrangling that must be resolved, the ultimate timing of a trial or trials remains up in the air.
Ms. Willis's office has also requested that arraignments take place in the week of Sept. 5. Defendants have the right to waive appearing at an arraignment, where defendants answer the charges against them.
On Thursday, Ms. Willis's office subpoenaed the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and a former chief investigator in Mr. Raffensperger's office, Frances Watson, to testify on Monday in connection with Mr. Meadows's effort to move the case to federal court.
Mr. Trump often abruptly reconfigures his legal team, and has cycled through scores of lawyers over his decades as a businessman and in his more recent political career. He has sometimes been known to refuse to pay lawyers for their work.
The lawyers working for him in connection with the four criminal cases are being paid, but not with Mr. Trump's personal funds; instead, he is using money donated by his supporters in the wake of the 2020 election, after he said he needed help to pursue claims of widespread voting fraud -- claims that were widely debunked.
A number of lawyers working on Mr. Trump's behalf have faced their own legal troubles recently, especially regarding the indictment in Georgia.
Mr. Sadow is widely seen in Atlanta legal circles as one of the city's most talented criminal defense lawyers. Like Mr. Findling, Mr. Sadow has represented rap clients, including T.I. and Rick Ross, and the singer Usher.
Mr. Sadow represented the rapper Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens, in a high-profile case in Fulton County. Mr. Kitchens pleaded guilty in December to a racketeering charge in the sprawling case against Young Slime Life, or YSL, an Atlanta hip-hop collective. He was released after his initial five-year sentence was commuted to time served, with the remainder suspended.
More than two decades ago, Mr. Sadow was a fixture in news reports about a scandal involving an Atlanta strip club called the Gold Club, which, according to federal prosecutors, had ties to the Gambino crime family of New York and was a den of prostitution and grift. Mr. Sadow represented the club's owner, Steven E. Kaplan, who pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge, an outcome Mr. Sadow called "a very good deal for all concerned."
When Mr. Trump chose Mr. Findling last summer to head his Georgia legal defense team, the choice fit with Mr. Trump's pop-culture ties and his affinity for oversize personalities. Mr. Findling, who is often photographed wearing stylish sunglasses, refers to himself as the #BillionDollarLawyer on Instagram, and has represented rappers including Cardi B, Gucci Mane and Migos.
Before he was hired, Mr. Findling had sharply criticized Mr. Trump numerous times on social media. In 2018, he referred to Mr. Trump as "the racist architect of fraudulent Trump University."
But once he was hired, Mr. Findling mounted a vigorous defense of Mr. Trump. Before the former president's indictment last week, Mr. Findling and his team sought to throw out evidence collected by a special grand jury, and to have Ms. Willis taken off the case.
His strategy was seen by many legal observers as aggressive but worth attempting, though it wore on the patience of the presiding judge and ultimately proved futile.
Like Mr. Findling, Mr. Sadow has publicly expressed misgivings about Mr. Trump. On the way to taking a swipe at the former F.B.I. director James Comey in one 2017 exchange on Twitter, Mr. Sadow made a point of noting that he was "not a DT supporter."

Three defendants are seeking to remove their cases to federal court: Meadows; Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official; and David Shafer, a former head of the Georgia Republican Party.
Another defendant, Kenneth Chesebro, filed a speedy-trial demand Wednesday, which under Georgia law would require the trial for all 19 defendants to begin by Nov. 3 — months earlier than prosecutors had sought.
On Thursday, the Fulton County district attorney, Fani T. Willis, filed a motion requesting that the trial start “for all 19 defendants” on Oct. 23. Trump then filed a response opposing the October trial date and noting that he would seek to sever his case from Chesebro’s and that of any other defendant who seeks a speedy trial.
On Thursday afternoon, the presiding judge, Scott McAfee, approved the speedy-trial request, though he made clear that the new trial date applied only to Chesebro.
Still, given all the pretrial wrangling that must be resolved, the ultimate timing of a trial or trials remains up in the air.
Willis’ office has also requested that arraignments take place in the week of Sept. 5. Defendants have the right to waive appearing at an arraignment, where defendants answer the charges against them.
On Thursday, Willis’ office subpoenaed the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and a former chief investigator in Raffensperger’s office, Frances Watson, to testify Monday in connection with Meadows’ effort to move the case to federal court.
Trump often abruptly reconfigures his legal team, and has cycled through scores of lawyers over his decades as a businessman and in his more recent political career. He has sometimes been known to refuse to pay lawyers for their work.
The lawyers working for him in connection with the four criminal cases are being paid, but not with Trump’s personal funds; instead, he is using money donated by his supporters in the wake of the 2020 election, after he said he needed help to pursue claims of widespread voting fraud — claims that were widely debunked.
A number of lawyers working on Trump’s behalf have faced their own legal troubles recently, especially regarding the indictment in Georgia.
Sadow is widely seen in Atlanta legal circles as one of the city’s most talented criminal defense lawyers. Like Findling, Sadow has represented rap clients, including T.I. and Rick Ross, and the singer Usher.
Sadow represented the rapper Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens, in a high-profile case in Fulton County. Kitchens pleaded guilty in December to a racketeering charge in the sprawling case against Young Slime Life, or YSL, an Atlanta hip-hop collective. He was released after his initial five-year sentence was commuted to time served, with the remainder suspended.
More than two decades ago, Sadow was a fixture in news reports about a scandal involving an Atlanta strip club called the Gold Club, which, according to federal prosecutors, had ties to the Gambino crime family of New York and was a den of prostitution and grift. Sadow represented the club’s owner, Steven E. Kaplan, who pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge, an outcome Sadow called “a very good deal for all concerned.”
When Trump chose Findling last summer to head his Georgia legal defense team, the choice fit with Trump’s pop-culture ties and his affinity for oversized personalities. Findling, who is often photographed wearing stylish sunglasses, refers to himself as the #BillionDollarLawyer on Instagram, and has represented rappers including Cardi B, Gucci Mane and Offset of Migos.
Before he was hired, Findling had sharply criticized Trump numerous times on social media. In 2018, he referred to Trump as “the racist architect of fraudulent Trump University.”
But once he was hired, Findling mounted a vigorous defense of Trump. Before the former president’s indictment last week, Findling and his team sought to throw out evidence collected by a special grand jury and to have Willis taken off the case.
His strategy was seen by many legal observers as aggressive but worth attempting, though it wore on the patience of the presiding judge and ultimately proved futile.
Like Findling, Sadow has publicly expressed misgivings about Trump. On the way to taking a swipe at former FBI director James Comey in one 2017 exchange on Twitter, Sadow made a point of noting that he was “not a DT supporter.”

Just before his visit to an Atlanta jail to be booked on 13 felony counts, Donald Trump has shaken up his Georgia legal defense team, adding Steve Sadow, a veteran criminal defense lawyer who has taken on a number of high-profile cases.
Sadow filed a document with the court on Thursday stating that he was now “lead counsel of record for Donald John Trump.”
Trump’s decision comes soon after one of his lawyers, Drew Findling, and his two other lawyers in the Georgia case, Jennifer Little and Marissa Goldberg, negotiated a $200,000 bond for Trump, who is one of 19 defendants in a sweeping racketeering indictment charging them with engaging in a “criminal enterprise” that sought to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.
Findling is expected to be let go, according to a person familiar with the matter, while Little will be retained.
Trump, who is often dissatisfied with lawyers he hires, had been inquiring for several days about who else he could bring in, according to a person familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly. Trump’s main concern, according to the person, was that he wanted a more “sophisticated” team.
Sadow said in a statement that Trump “should never have been indicted,” adding, “He is innocent of all the charges brought against him.”
“Prosecutions intended to advance or serve the ambitions and careers of political opponents of the president have no place in our justice system,” he said.
The shake-up was first reported by ABC News.
Trump is expected to surrender on Thursday at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, where he is likely to be fingerprinted and photographed, as is usually done with all criminal defendants in the county.
Supporters of Trump began arriving outside the jail early in the morning; by 9:30 a.m., dozens of people were there, carrying signs and shouting slogans.
Rick Hearn, 44, an Atlanta accountant, displayed a poster with an image of Trump next to one of Nelson Mandela, with the title “political prisoners.”
“I feel like I needed to be a part of this,” Hearn said, adding that “those in charge” need to know that they could not “take away our rights and get away with it.”
The Georgia indictment, released last week, is the fourth criminal case against Trump to be filed this year. It targets not just him, but also an array of his allies, who are accused of engaging in election interference after the November 2020 vote. The defendants include Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former lawyer, and Mark Meadows, Trump’s former White House chief of staff.
As of Thursday morning, nearly half of the 19 defendants had been booked at the jail, and a cascade of legal maneuvering was underway. Three defendants are seeking to remove their cases to federal court: Meadows; Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official; and David Shafer, a former head of the Georgia Republican Party.
Another defendant, Kenneth Chesebro, filed a speedy-trial demand on Wednesday, which under Georgia law would require the trial for all 19 defendants to begin by Nov. 3 — months earlier than prosecutors had sought.
Given all the pretrial wrangling that must be resolved, the ultimate timing of a trial or trials remains up in the air.
The office of the Fulton County district attorney, Fani T. Willis, is prosecuting the case. Her office has requested that arraignments take place in the week of Sept. 5. Defendants have the right to waive appearing at an arraignment, where defendants answer the charges against them.
On Thursday, Willis’ office subpoenaed the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and a former chief investigator in Raffensperger’s office, Frances Watson, to testify on Monday in connection with Meadows’ effort to move the case to federal court.

Full text: Brevity is key, experts say.
Last weekend, as I was cleaning up a mess in the kitchen, my husband was parked in the living room, absorbed in his phone.
I asked him for help. Silence. I asked again. Nothing. As I shoved plates and bowls into the dishwasher, I slipped into an old habit: I imagined a thought bubble above his head.
"Life is good," it said. "I'm kicking back while my wife does everything! My time is more valuable than hers!"
This relationship-sabotaging practice is known by many names: Some call it "the story I am making up," or "the story I am telling myself right now." Terrence Real, a family therapist and the author of "Us: Getting Past You and Me to Build a More Loving Relationship," calls it "unconscious storytelling" -- and it happens when you imagine what your partner is thinking or feeling.
Making these assumptions can escalate an argument and distort the issue, Real said. Instead, he counsels people to share perceived slights using a therapeutic tool known as "the feedback wheel." This simple, four-sentence method -- adapted, he said, from the work of the therapist Janet Hurley -- helps loved ones share grievances in ways that speed the repair process.
When you find yourself in a storytelling spiral, pause and remind yourself that you care about the person who has upset you, Real said. Then ask if it's a good time to talk.
If they're open to hearing about your frustrations, use these four statements:
1. "This is what I saw or heard."
Describe what happened in one sentence, Real said. "Share only the facts -- ones a camera could record," he said. The key to this statement, and the feedback wheel overall, is its brevity, Real said.
2. "This is what I made up about it."
Explaining your personal point of view "acts as a circuit breaker," said Alexandra Solomon, a professor of psychology at Northwestern University and the author of "Loving Bravely." Not only does this take the heat off the other person, she said, but it compels you to examine your own emotions. "The stories we tell ourselves are informed by our internal landscape of wounds and tender spots and traumas and patterns," she said.
Using this phrase helps acknowledge that your perception might be inaccurate. "It's taking responsibility that this is your construction," Real said.
3. "This is how I felt."
Take a moment to focus on your emotions. Then describe them, concisely, to your partner, Real said. You might say that you're scared, hurt or angry, he explained. "Feelings only," he said, "not thoughts or beliefs." Sharing your feelings helps you move from the "reactive parts of your brain," Real said, and into what he calls "the wise adult."
4. "This is what would help me feel better."
This final statement, Real said, is one that most people leave out. But making your needs clear is a necessary step because "you can't complain about not getting what you never asked for," he said.
By sharing the story you made up, your feelings and your needs, Real said, you're shifting from anger to vulnerability. You "say what needs to be said," Real added, but it's done with respect.
Ideally, Dr. Solomon added, "the other person responds feeling grateful for their partner's vulnerability rather than guilt-tripped or defensive."
Using these statements with my husband has been a game-changer: Sometimes my interpretations of his behavior are so off base that when I tell him, we laugh -- and the tension is broken.
In the case of the dishes, I eventually stormed into the living room and told my husband that I'd concocted a story that involved him deliberately ignoring me and prioritizing his leisure time over mine.
"I'm sorry, what?" he said, taking out his earbuds.
Your pain is being ignored by your doctor. What should you do?
Most health care providers do not have formal training in pain management -- and when patients do report pain, there are racial, socioeconomic and gender disparities in how they are treated. Four physicians who specialize in treating pain offer advice on how to advocate for yourself. For starters: Trust your gut, and consider bringing a support person.

Britney Spears Musical Will Close Soon: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The show, which was capitalized for $ 20 million, will end its Broadway run on Sept. 3 after 123 performances. Its producers say they are planning a national tour.
"Once Upon a One More Time," a pop musical using the songs of Britney Spears, will close on Broadway on Sept. 3 after opening to mixed reviews and failing to find an audience.
The musical was a costly misfire, capitalized for $ 20 million at a time when many Broadway shows have been struggling with rising costs and diminished attendance after a pandemic shutdown that made an always challenging industry even more difficult.
"Once Upon a One More Time" is about a group of fairy tale heroines whose outlook on their familiar stories is shaken when the book club to which they belong encounters a feminist classic, "The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan.
The musical features some of Spears's biggest hits, including "Baby One More Time," "Toxic" and "Circus." The songs have several writers but were originally performed and recorded by Spears; the musical's book is by Jon Hartmere and it was directed and choreographed by Keone and Mari Madrid.
The musical was first announced in 2019, with plans for an initial production in Chicago, but that production was delayed until the following spring and then canceled by the pandemic. Ultimately, the show started its first run in late 2021 at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C., where reviews were weak but sales were strong.
Spears's relationship to the show was never clear. The show repeatedly described itself as "fully authorized and licensed post-conservatorship by Britney Spears," and she wished the cast and crew well on Instagram in June, writing, "I've seen the show and it is so funny, smart and brilliant ð¤© !!!"
But Spears did not attend a public performance, and her fan base never fully mobilized to see the production. The show's grosses were soft from the get-go, peaking at $ 701,425 during the week of its opening, which is not nearly enough to sustain a musical of this scale. During the week that ended Aug. 13, the show played to houses that were only 47 percent full, and grossed just $ 512,008.
The show began previews on May 13 and opened on June 22 at the Marquis Theater. At the time of its closing it will have played 123 performances.
The lead producers are James L. Nederlander and Hunter Arnold; they said in a statement on Monday that they were planning a national tour as well as "multiple international productions."
The closing announcement comes at a difficult time for Spears. Last week her husband, Sam Asghari, filed for divorce just over a year after they got married.

Covid Silver Lining for Parisian Cafes and Patrons: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The neighbors may complain about the noise, but outdoor spaces that bloomed under a pandemic program are now a permanent and vibrant fixture of city life.
The sound of clinking wine glasses floated through the evening air recently as throngs of patrons sipped chilled rosé and nibbled on cheese plates in front of the cafes, restaurants and épiceries bordering Place d'Aligre in the Bastille district of Paris.
Waiters threaded through the crowd, their trays loaded with Aperol spritzes and oysters, as more people hurried in to meet friends. Children played tag and scampered to their parents to grab an occasional French fry. Tourists ordered drinks and posed for Instagram photos sure to inspire envy back home.
The diners were squeezed into hundreds of chairs that had been put out earlier in the afternoon. But time was precious; the entire inviting setup would have to be dismantled by 10 p.m. under strict post-pandemic rules to balance the interests of those enjoying the scene -- and those finding it a nuisance.
Paris has long been renowned for its bustling cafe culture, with 13,000 open-air terraces occupying sidewalks and squares in the years before the pandemic. But thousands of additional outdoor spaces bloomed under an emergency program set up to relieve businesses during Covid lockdowns. They are now permanent, after a 2021 decree by Mayor Anne Hidalgo that allows them to return every year from April through November.
As a result, parts of Paris that used to be vacant or even sketchy have morphed into animated destinations, complete with a mini-economic boom.
The Place d'Aligre is one of them. Mostly empty at night before 2020, a vibrant transformation has unfolded here.
"The scene has changed completely," said Laurent Zennadi, a manager at Chez Camille, a family-run cafe that used to cater mostly to a morning and lunchtime crowd from the nearby Marche d'Aligre, a food market founded in 1779. "Nobody used to come here in the evening. Now they are coming from all over Paris."
At Salvo Olio e Vino en Vrac, an Italian deli sought out for its truffled hams and wines dispensed from barrels, Salvatore Cantarella, the owner, welcomed a wave of new clients to the Place d'Aligre after receiving a license to open a "terrace estivale," or summer terrace. The extra business kept him from going under. "I'm so grateful there's a positive outcome," he said.
Most of Paris's new summer terraces occupy parking spots, nearly 4,000 of which have been covered in temporary wooden decks. The Seine's banks are also blanketed with pop-up tables, as are rooftops with panoramic views.
With less room for cars now -- and after Covid-era cycling lanes were made permanent -- thousands of people are pedaling to the city's hottest spots.
"It's so lovely here," said Claire-Anne Haines, an event organizer who was hemmed behind a tiny table with her friends at a bistro's parking-space terrace on the Rue Condorcet in Montmartre. "The terrace looked nice while I was biking past, so I told my friends to come," she said.
It all plays into a bigger blueprint laid out by Ms. Hidalgo to make Paris a more environmentally friendly metropolis by liberating public space from cars and repurposing it for pedestrians and communal activity.
Not everyone welcomes the changes.
Resident associations have clashed with the city over the noise that the terraces bring and have continued to press the authorities over who should control streets and sidewalks.
Critics accuse Ms. Hidalgo of allowing businesses to privatize the public domain. Drivers rail about lost parking. And a hashtag, #saccageparis -- or "pillage Paris" -- has become an outlet for outraged people to post photos of ramshackle terraces that they say are a blot on the beauty of the city.
"The situation is infernal," said Eric Durand, a spokesman for Droit au Sommeil, or Right to Sleep, a citizens group with representatives in every section of Paris.
The cacophony has grown exponentially where he lives, near the Rue des Abbesses in Montmartre, he said. Some neighbors have moved away. Those who can't afford to are forced to keep their windows closed or -- a horror to Parisians -- buy air-conditioning units to keep cool on summer nights when the terraces are going full blast.
"We want this invasion of public space to stop," Mr. Durand said.
But at City Hall, officials say the summer terraces are here to stay.
"Paris is the city of cafes; they are part of the French art de vivre," said Olivia Polski, the deputy mayor of Paris responsible for trade, using a French phrase meaning "the art of living."
Today, 4,000 summer terraces are authorized through a paid license, compared with 14,000 that were free to open under emergency Covid policies. The terraces must meet new guidelines for aesthetics and noise, and must shut by 10 p.m. Loud music is forbidden, and owners face "an arsenal of sanctions and new legislation for infractions," Ms. Polski said, including steep fines or the loss of their operating license.
Over 200 were shuttered last year for violations.
In Place de la Réunion, a bucolic square in eastern Paris that is adorned with umbrella pines and an ornamented fountain, cafe operators consulted with local residents to address concerns.
"We listened to neighbors and learned to work things out," said Perrine Virey, a manager at Café La Chope, whose summer terrace seats up to 130 people, compared with 40 at the cafe's regular terrace before Covid. Solutions included not throwing bottles away at night and starting to move diners out of the square at 9:45, she said.
With hundreds of people gathered each night, the area feels safer and more convivial, locals said. A village ambience reigned one recent evening as children capered about while their parents lingered at tables. Friends with pink hair sipped orange spritzes before heading to an L.G.B.T.Q. dance club.
In addition to the noise complaints, another downside, some Parisians say, is that the success of the terrace project is speeding gentrification in socially mixed areas. "It's pushing poorer people out of the spaces that they used to inhabit," said Rafael Ludovici, a graduate student.
But in the Place d'Aligre, terrace supporters said the summer diners had revitalized the working-class neighborhood. At La Grille, a bistro hangout for over 40 years that nearly went bust as Covid hit, a dozen new employees have been hired to tend to the growing crowds.
On the recent evening, after the Aligre food market closed and street cleaners washed the pavement clean, a vintage 1930s Renault truck loaded with La Grille's outdoor tables and chairs rolled up. By 5 p.m., a colorful terrace had sprung seemingly out of nowhere, and an hour later, dozens of patrons had settled in.
"It's completely added to the charm of the place, and creates a connection between people," said Omar Hammouche, La Grille's owner, as a stream of habitués stopped to shake his hand.
At Chez Camille, Mr. Zennadi and his family installed new outdoor seating for about 100 people, on top of 400 seats added by other cafes to the square. Last year, the family invested around 15,000 euros, or $ 16,500, for the terrace license and to upgrade the outdoor furniture, among other improvements.
Recently, the cafe even started its own microbrewery, Mr. Zennadi noted proudly.
"Nobody wanted Covid to happen," Mr. Zennadi said as a coterie of friends gathered on the sun-dappled terrace for an aperitif. "But we can be thankful for the good things that have come out of it."

Richardson Is the Fastest Woman in the World: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Richardson outran Shericka Jackson and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce to take home her first major world championship title.
Sha'Carri Richardson has been repeating a mantra since returning to the track this season: She's not back, she's better.
Richardson, who missed the Tokyo Olympics after testing positive for marijuana a month before the Games, delivered the ultimate "I told you so" on Monday in Budapest by winning her first title at a world track and field championships, running 10.65 seconds to win the 100 meters. Shericka Jackson of Jamaica was second, in 10.72, and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, also of Jamaica, was third, in 10.77.
With her victory, Richardson, 23, both softened and amplified the noise that has surrounded her since she burst on the professional running scene.
"Honestly I don't even know what to say," Richardson said an hour after she had crossed the finish line and stared up at the results with a look of equal parts disbelief and nirvana. "It's surreal. I think in the morning I'll probably feel it."
She got to this place by finding her peace, she said at a news conference at the Los Angeles Grand Prix in May.
"These last three years, I've shown you what I can do," Richardson said. "It just was me that was standing in my way. Now I'm with myself."
That has resulted in some of her fastest times.
She opened her outdoor season in April, running a wind-aided 10.57. (The time would have been considered her personal best, but the tailwind was above what is allowable for records.) The next month, she won the 100 meters at a Diamond League meet in Doha, Qatar, defeating Jackson, an Olympic and world championship podium mainstay. She defeated Jackson again in July at a Diamond League meet in Poland.
The national championships in Eugene, Ore., where she could qualify for her first world championships after failing to do so in 2022, were finally on the horizon.
It was there, at Hayward Field, in June 2021, that Richardson had first become a sensation. She had run 10.72 -- what was then the sixth-fastest women's 100 meters in history -- a few months prior, and stepped into stardom when she won the 100 meters at the national championships with a dominant performance, finishing in 10.86.
She was quickly pegged as America's next great sprinter and a favorite heading into the Tokyo Olympics.
But on July 1, 2021, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced she had tested positive for marijuana, automatically wiping out her result. Her 30-day suspension meant she would not be able to compete in the marquee event at the Olympics. The suspension fueled debates over whether marijuana should be on the list of banned substances.
This year's national championships -- a qualifying meet for the world championships -- would be different. She made sure to prove that as soon as she stepped onto the track for the first round of competition on July 6.
Richardson ran a remarkable 10.71, her personal best at the time. She seemed to even pump the brakes before the finish line, holding her hands down as if she needed gravity to keep her spikes on the track. She cruised through the semifinals, advancing to the final round with a time of 10.75. The next-fastest seed time heading into the final was 10.96.
Richardson had been wearing an orange wig through the first rounds, which is what she wore for much of her 2021 season. She wore the same wig as she ran through the qualifying heats and the semifinals, and added a green headband when she walked into the stadium for the 100-meter final last month. When her name was announced, she pulled on her headband to take the wig off. She threw it behind her and looked forward. The crowd roared. She won in 10.82.
"Last time I was really here in a big stadium I had my orange hair and I wanted to show you guys that I'm still that girl but I'm better. I'm still that girl but I'm stronger. I'm still that girl but I'm wiser," she said to Tiara Williams in an interview posted on Instagram after she secured her spot in Budapest.
Her debut on the world championships stage on Sunday could not have gone better. Richardson cruised to a win, slowing in the final few meters as she mimicked wiping sweat from her brow. She won her heat with a time of 10.92, and once again led the field into the semifinals. Only three of the 54 sprinters in the opening heat went below 11 seconds.
In her semifinals, a slow reaction time had Richardson off to a unpromising start. She was able to finish in 10.84, but unable to secure one of the two automatic qualifying slots after finishing third behind Jackson and Marie-Josée Ta Lou. It was quickly clear that her time would move her to the final.
She said her goal for this year was to "to do what I should have done in these last two years already."
She was assigned Lane 9 in the final, the furthest outside lane on the track. It's not a desirable position as it's nearly impossible to get a sense of the field as the race progresses, and medals are determined by milliseconds.
That is, unless the person in Lane 9 is leading and has no one in her periphery. It was the position Richardson found herself in after catching up to Jackson, Fraser-Pryce and Ta Lou, then passing them, with just a few strides to go.
At the start of the race, the opportunity was right in front of her. Then, 10.65 seconds later, she grabbed it.

World Cup Victory Is Marred By an Intrusion of Machismo: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A soccer federation chief kissed the Spanish forward Jennifer Hermoso fully on the lips during the medals ceremony, an unpleasant reminder to many of the sexism that has plagued women's soccer.
Spaniards celebrated their country's first Women's World Cup victory on Sunday afternoon by holding dance parties in the streets and sharing their giddy delight.
But it was a kiss seen around the world that was the talk of social media.
Amid the national jubilation, many were jolted by an impromptu kiss planted on the Spanish forward Jennifer Hermoso by the president of Spain's soccer federation, Luis Rubiales, during the medals ceremony, an unpleasant reminder to many of the sexism scandals that have plagued Spanish women's soccer.
After the Spanish players defeated England 1-0 and lined up onstage in Sydney, Australia, to collect their medals before lifting the World Cup trophy, Mr. Rubiales enthusiastically grabbed Ms. Hermoso, kissed her on the cheeks and then kissed her fully on the lips, video of the encounter showed. Spain's Queen Letizia was onstage at the time.
Later, in another video, Ms. Hermoso is seen apparently making her distaste known, responding, "Hey, but I didn't like that!"
The video of what many concluded had been an unwanted smooch was widely shared on social media, spurring confusion among many Spaniards and prompting others to denounce it as highly inappropriate behavior. Some called it disgraceful and evidence of lingering sexism in soccer. Others demanded that Mr. Rubiales resign.
As of Sunday night, he had not responded to the criticism. The soccer federation did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment from Mr. Rubiales as it was late in Spain.
The kissing episode revived memories of the mistreatment of Spain's female soccer players. For 27 years, the women's national team had the same coach, who was infamous for dismissing the players as "chavalitas," or immature girls. He was dismissed in 2015 after players protested.
Current members of the women's national team have also complained that they have been disrespected by top male soccer executives and denied the kind of elite equipment and treatment given to the men's teams. The women have said that the facilities the federation provided for them are subpar and that Jorge Vilda, their coach, fostered an oppressive workplace environment, one in which the players' every move was monitored by his staff.
Last fall, many players revolted against the coach and federation, accusing them of mistreatment and withdrawing from consideration for the national team. Ms. Hermoso was seen as having tacitly supported the rebellion.
The controversies did not stop Spain from winning this year's World Cup. But the sudden kiss added another dimension to the women's victory.
In a live video posted on Instagram and shared on other social media platforms, Ms. Hermoso is seen celebrating with her teammates in the locker room after the final and smiling even as she says the kiss was not wanted.
Adding to the confusion, Mr. Rubiales is heard in another video telling the players that they would be rewarded with a trip to Ibiza for their victory and adding that it would be an opportunity to celebrate his "wedding" to Ms. Hermoso -- an apparent reference to the kiss.
There is no indication that Mr. Rubiales and Ms. Hermoso are in a relationship.
Nadia Tronchoni, an editor at El País, Spain's biggest newspaper, noted in an opinion piece that Sunday's victory was "more than a title" for Spanish women.
"The women, the girls of this country celebrated the fact that our stubbornness has finally defeated machismo," she said, referring to female players' long struggle to be recognized. "Rubiales's kiss to Hermoso reminds us that the road ahead is a long one."

'Strays' Joins Lineup of Films Affected by the Actors' Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The R-rated comedy opened to a fifth place showing this weekend, while the comic book movie "Blue Beetle" came in at No. 1. Both were hurt by the actors' strike.
When selling a movie about raunchy talking dogs, it helps to have some star power to get moviegoers into seats.
And "Strays," which opened Friday, has it -- at least on the screen. Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher are among those who contribute their comic voice talents. Normally, a cast like this would translate into countless promotional appearances in settings like "Saturday Night Live," late-night talk shows and on social media platforms. Not during the actors' strike, when such efforts by the actors are forbidden.
Instead, the most exciting thing to happen during the press tour for the film may have been during a rehearsal for a segment on NBC's "Today" show when Dylan Dreyer, a meteorologist, took a tumble while practicing a trick with an Australian Shepherd.
"Strays," which had a budget of $ 46 million, is one of four movies that opened widely across the country this weekend. It grossed an estimated $ 8.3 million for a fifth place showing, a poor opening and not close to the number Universal Pictures was hoping for when it greenlit the film. (The studio's previous R-rated comedy that paired raunchy material with family-friendly characters, "Good Boys," opened in 2019 to $ 21 million. "Cocaine Bear," also from Universal, had a far more robust opening, $ 23 million, back in February.)
The winner of the weekend, the Warner Bros. DC film "Blue Beetle," earned $ 25.4 million, an average showing for a lesser-known comic book movie. The film, heavy on special effects, cost over $ 100 million to make and market.
"I wish 'Blue Beetle' would have been higher," said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution. "I think that we clearly were disadvantaged by not being able to bring the movie to Comic Con and not being able to bring out our 'Cobra Kai' star, Xolo Mariduena, as his fans know him, to the world. So that was tough."
Both films are the latest examples of opening weekends hurt because their movie stars are unable to promote their latest work. The early summer successes of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" can't hide the larger reality that red carpets are lacking the pop and sizzle of the cameras and box office receipts are depressed.
"So far, 'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer,' 'Talk to Me,' 'Ninja Turtles,' and 'The Meg 2' got by untouched," the box office analyst David A. Gross said. "But we're coming up on some titles that will be impacted."
He pointed to, among others, "Strays"; "Golda," which stars Helen Mirren as the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir; a new "Equalizer" film featuring Denzel Washington that will open on Labor Day weekend; and the latest in the "Big Fat Greek Wedding" series.
The lack of celebrity promotion, Mr. Gross said, is likely to cost the films anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of their box office revenue. Studio executives have grumbled that some films could have made $ 5 million to $ 10 million more on opening weekend if their stars had been able to promote them. For original films not based on well-known intellectual property, the hit might be even more severe.
Asked on Sunday morning about the poor opening for "Strays," Jim Orr, Universal's president of domestic distribution, acknowledged, "I was hoping for more." But he said he remained optimistic that the R-rated comedy would attract more moviegoers in the weeks to come. "We will see how the rest of the summer and September treats us."
In the absence of actors, studio marketing teams are relying heavily on directors to promote the films, and they are spending more on advertising.
Angel Manuel Soto, the director of "Blue Beetle," has been an especially crucial part of the Warner Bros. marketing campaign. He traveled to England, Mexico and around the United States, including Puerto Rico, to host screenings and conduct an estimated 100 interviews with print, broadcast and radio outlets. The studio recently posted a video of Mr. Soto revealing to Mr. Mariduena that he was the choice to play the lead role. It was a moment that in normal times would have been a moving anecdote during a late-night interview but was instead boosted with advertising and aimed toward building interest in the film among Latinos.
On the eve of the actors' strike, Mr. Mariduena posted a video to his 3.3 million followers on Instagram, urging them to come out to the film. "I won't be able to promote this movie, but you can," he said. "Let's do this for the culture, let's do this for the community, let's do this for the opportunity for others."
The movie industry was dealing with major issues long before the strike. Moviegoing, even factoring in the Barbenheimer phenomenon, is down 14 percent from 2019, before the pandemic, according to analysts. Certain genres, like R-rated comedies, have been hit especially hard. The summer's biggest original comedy was Jennifer Lawrence's "No Hard Feelings," which made $ 50 million at the North American box office.
Given that the aftereffects of the pandemic are lingering and the strikes are continuing, it's likely that the situation at the box office is only going to get more unpredictable.
"Moviegoing used to be a habit for people," Michael Moses, the chief marketing officer for Universal, said. "Our job as marketing was to get them to pick our movie over the others. Now our job is to get them to go to the movies and then choose our movie over the others."

Some Birthday Greetings Now Call for Birthday Suits: [Style Desk]

Full text: For a certain class of extremely online gay man, explicit photos are the go-to gift for friends and followers.
When David Dulin celebrated his 36th birthday in March, he asked his Twitter followers for just two things: cash donations to his online payment account, and pictures of them in their own birthday suits.
"It started as a joke, but it's just become something that we run with," said Mr. Dulin, a retail worker in Charlotte, N.C. "Almost every birthday I'll be like, 'OK, Cash App and nudes: Drop them!"'
Mr. Dulin began coyly asking for nude photographs via social media on his birthday a few years ago as something of a test after seeing other gay men make similar requests on their own birthdays. He was surprised, he said, when some of his online acquaintances delivered on the invitation, admitting that they had been looking for an opportunity to flirt with him.
In recent years, many queer men have begun sending and receiving nude selfies on social media for their birthdays. Variations on "It's my birthday, send nudes" have been uttered so frequently online that it has become something of a meme (or, at the very least, a generic way for a gay man to announce his birthday, whether or not he actually expects to receive any explicit images). The practice has become so normalized that the request is sometimes simplified to, "It's my birthday -- you know what to do."
Brendan Drake, 36, a choreographer in Los Angeles who identifies as genderqueer, said he had made the request so often that this year on his birthday he received nudes from friends without even having to ask. "It's almost like it was expected," he said.
The trend of gay men soliciting nudes on their birthday speaks to the unique nature of gay friendships, but also plays into a social media culture that rewards humor, according to Tom Roach, who teaches gender and sexuality studies at Bryant University in Smithfield, R.I.
"I think it's basically a provocation and a challenge, but in a campy way -- it has a certain 'wink, wink, nod, nod' feel to it," said Professor Roach, who has written books on queer friendships and digital relationships. "I don't think people are sincerely, desperately seeking nude pictures of their friends. I think they're doing it to be provocative, to be like, 'Look at how shamelessly sex-positive I am!"'
In many parts of the country, it is not uncommon for gay people to have a more relaxed attitude toward sex, including alternatives to monogamy such as open relationships, and many gay friendships begin as casual sex encounters. A 2022 study also found that 85 percent of respondents who were in same-sex relationships had formed romantic partnerships out of friendships, while only 68 percent of all respondents said they had taken the "friends-to-lovers pathway."
Gay men, of course, are not a monolith. But given the community was born out of a shared sexual attraction to men, Professor Roach said, it doesn't surprise him that friendships between gay men today "don't play by the same rules" as others.
In addition to cellphone cameras making it far easier to quickly snap and send a racy photo, social media apps like Instagram and X -- the platform formerly known as Twitter -- allow users to curate private lists of "close friends." For many gay men, the feature can be used to ensure that an open call for birthday nudes reaches only a carefully selected audience -- one excluding straight friends and colleagues.
Some of these behaviors mimic well-established practices on hookup apps, where the trading of sexually explicit images can be de rigueur. "It's also importing some of the norms of Grindr into other platforms that don't necessarily traffic in nudes," Professor Roach said. "It's kind of like worlds colliding."
A birthday can also pose an opportunity for someone ordinarily too shy to solicit nudes to do so in a socially sanctioned way, while the messages themselves can function as an all-purpose declaration of consent for others to shoot their shot in the most risqué way possible.
"It really feels like a way of publicly doing so where the shame will just be slightly less," said Manuel Betancourt, 38, the author of "The Male Gazed," a collection of essays on thirst traps and queer longing. "Then, it can be a door, or it can be a window, or it could be sort of an opening into something else."
The decision to send a birthday nude is often predicated on feelings of attraction, but it's not always about seeking sex. Jake Niemeyer, a 32-year-old television editor in Los Angeles, said he had sent birthday nudes to online acquaintances as far away as Scotland with no expectations of physical intimacy.
"There's next to no chance I will ever see this person in-person," Mr. Niemeyer said. "But still, I find them attractive, they say they find me attractive and that's kind of a nice feeling. It's a safe way for both of you to have a micro sexual interaction."
In a group that often celebrates and rewards idealized muscular bodies, leading some gay men to develop body-image issues, the act of swapping nudes with trusted friends can actually prove to be deeply affirming.
"It's very body-positive," said Zachary Zane, 32, a bisexual sex columnist. "You feel sexy, you feel affirmed, you feel validated and loved by your friends. It's not an invitation to hook up; it's more so us actually just supporting each other and showing each other love."
The pandemic isolation of 2020 may have fueled the sharing of nude images among gay men who felt cut off from one another. For Mr. Drake, the choreographer, those fearful months made him worry less about whether his nude images were floating around online. Alone for several months with just his phone for company, he also found important intimacy in trading nudes with friends.
Having an online outlet for sexual expression "was actually a little lifesaving for me," Mr. Drake said. "A lot of people will call it toxic, but I don't think it's toxic. I think it's really life-affirming."

Full text: AMID THE STAID and stately stone and brick homes along the north side of St. Louis's Forest Park sits one house that's impossible to miss. As a child, the 48-year-old artist Katherine Bernhardt, who grew up a couple of miles away in Clayton, would marvel at the boxy, three-story structure -- a commingling of mostly rectangular forms and cutouts, with a white plaster surface and a frame that stretches past the living quarters -- through the window of her parents' minivan as they drove past it. Four years ago, she and her now-12-year-old son, Khalifa, moved back to her hometown from New York, where she'd spent more than two decades, in part to be closer to her parents but also because she was seeking a change. On a whim, Bernhardt went online to see if the property was for sale; she was handed the keys six months later.
The 6,000-square-foot Smith House, as it's known, was designed by Gary Glenn, who studied architecture at nearby Washington University in the 1960s. While on military duty overseas, he visited famed Modernist sites, including the Bauhaus in Germany, and Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation apartment complex in Marseille, France; he later worked in the architect Arne Jacobsen's office in Copenhagen. Upon returning to St. Louis, Glenn bounced around a few different architecture firms before starting his own practice in 1979. One of his occasional collaborators was Marcia Smith, an interior designer and boutique owner with bold, contemporary tastes. In 1984, the two paired up to build Smith and her husband, Herb's, house; what they created was a sensation. The Smiths' daughter, Ashley Smith Baptiste, who was in high school when she moved in with her parents and older brother the following year, says her peers called it "the 'Miami Vice' house" (the music video for the rapper Murphy Lee's 2003 song "Hold Up," featuring Nelly, would be filmed there).
While the structure itself epitomized the International Style that Le Corbusier and others popularized in the 1920s and '30s, its interiors were decorated with various pieces produced for or in the playful style of the Memphis Group, the design collective founded in 1980 by the Italian architect Ettore Sottsass. By the time Bernhardt arrived, however -- the Smiths moved out in 2002 -- the neon address sign that had shone from the entryway was gone; the built-ins had been ripped out; a wall had been fitted to the zigzag spine of an open staircase to accommodate a large TV; and what had once been black, white or vibrant, such as a cylindrical tomato red range hood in the kitchen, had been replaced with shades of gray.
TODAY, AFTER A 17-month-long renovation that is still ongoing, Bernhardt seems like the inevitable occupant of the Smith House. There are strong similarities between the 44 or so Memphis pieces she sourced for the home -- from Masanori Umeda's Tawaraya, a semi-enclosed platform that looks like a boxing ring but is meant to be used for conversation or lounging, to Martine Bedin's Super lamp, with wheels like those on a toy car and exposed bulbs positioned as if on the curved back of a Stegosaurus -- and Bernhardt's own flamboyant paintings: joyful, slightly abstract takes on familiar objects and icons such as cigarettes, melon slices, toilet-paper rolls, Diet Coke cans, Doritos, Swatches, Bart Simpson, Miss Piggy and E.T. (Her most recent show, at David Zwirner in Hong Kong, consisted of re-creations of Pokémon cards.) Her aim is not to exalt the mundane to the level of high art but to make us see her subjects anew and, while she's at it, make us smile.
In this way, too, Bernhardt is Memphis-aligned. Sottsass's philosophy, as he made clear when he invited his designer friends over for what would be the group's first meeting (Bob Dylan's "Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again" was playing in the background), was to make radical furniture that could be mass-produced, in humble materials such as terrazzo and plastic laminate. And if neither he nor Memphis ever became household names in the United States, their influence is now indelible. Before Bernhardt had ever heard of Memphis (and before the group's Instagram-fueled revival), she was obsessed with Esprit, the clothing company whose 1980s designs evoked the Milan-based collective by way of California. Nowadays, she keeps a closet's worth of old Esprit pieces -- a shift with green and white stripes, a vest printed with multicolored ladybugs -- in a guest bedroom that's also home to a free-standing wardrobe modeled after one of Sottsass's Superboxes.
In fact, Bernhardt considers the whole house a container for the '80s. Upon entering the L-shaped structure, a visitor is confronted by a Sottsass floor lamp that looks a bit like the face of an insect and, just behind it, a Bernhardt painting of E.T. in the shower. To the left is the dining room, which, as in the Smiths' day, has black walls and an asymmetrical glass-topped bar cart by Javier Mariscal for Memphis. To the right is the living room, for which Bernhardt commissioned a replica of a wet bar that Marcia Smith had designed with Memphis laminate. The artist based the room's terrazzo floor -- speckled white squiggles against speckled black -- on a Marco Zanini drawing that appears on the cover of "Memphis: The New International Style" (1981). On the second floor, Bernhardt's bedroom (there are four in total) features a wavy-edged Ultrafragola mirror (Sottsass again); an attached bathroom tiled in a Southwestern motif; and a spiral staircase leading to the third-floor library, which is filled with books about Memphis. Keith Johnson, the primary North American dealer of Memphis pieces, thinks the house might be the most thorough and daring homage to the movement in the country.
But it isn't just a tribute. The '80s-era furnishings live alongside contemporary artworks by Katherine Bradford, Rafael Ferrer, Marcus Jahmal, Eddie Martinez, Zéh Palito, Mary Weatherford and others. Bernhardt also strayed from how the house first looked by making the kitchen, like that in her parents' home, mostly turquoise -- and, in a nod to both the Mexican architect Luis Barragán and the Pink Panther, another recurring figure in her work, painting the back of the house mostly electric pink.
The artist gets a clear view of those pink walls many evenings when, after coming home from her studio -- a former auto body repair shop in St. Louis's Midtown neighborhood -- she sits in the hot tub nestled inside the outdoor pool, which is surrounded by concrete slabs painted to create long lines of alternating hues: lavender and orange, black and green, red and brown. On the day that Glenn came over to see what Bernhardt had done with the place (he approved), she told him that a pair of ducks had also started frequenting the pool area. "Maybe," he said, "they like the colors."

What Makes a Comic's Bells Go Off: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Judy Gold loves Provincetown, Mass., where she has been performing since 1992, but she hates the slow drivers.
Judy Gold owes her comedy career to a dare. One night while she was attending Rutgers University, a classmate challenged her to do stand-up in a student lounge, Ms. Gold recalled. "That was the first laugh I got," she said. "It was the most amazing feeling, like an out-of-body experience."
Forty years -- and two books, three albums, three solo shows, a slew of comedy specials and a podcast later -- Ms. Gold, 60, is still making people laugh. She now does it three times a week in a one-woman show, "Everything Hurts Everywhere All at Once," running through Sept. 3 at the Post Office Cafe and Cabaret in Provincetown, Mass.
Though Ms. Gold has lived in a rental apartment on the Upper West Side for decades, she purchased a three-bedroom condo in Provincetown in 1994. During the summer, she lives there with her fiancée, Elysa Halpern, 61, a therapist, whom she met on a blind date arranged by Time Out New York in 2007. They're sometimes joined by Ms. Gold's two children, Henry, 26, and Ben, 22.
NO TRIGGERS The alarm clock here is broken, so at 9 a.m. I wake up to Sonata in E Major by Scarlatti on my iPhone. I have a hard time getting out of bed because I suffer from diurnal depression and alarms are triggers. Classical music, which I love, doesn't assault my brain. I might do a nine-minute snoozy.
COFFEE AND A SONG I go downstairs to make coffee and I hear Elysa singing, which she does when she wakes up. I love that about her. Right now she's into "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia." My current grind is Kicking Horse Coffee's Grizzly Claw. I drink it black and strong -- I'm a purist.
READY TO GO I put on my tennis clothes and go outside to get The Times, because they don't put it on my doorstep. I stretch on the floor for five minutes and then make us a shake with almond milk, whey protein, berries, bananas, powdered peanut butter, kale and chia seeds. Then I put my tennis bag together and pack two bottles of water: one with ice, the other with watermelon-flavored Liquid I.V., my favorite of these little packets.
SLOW COMMUTE By 11 a.m. we leave for tennis. It's only two miles, but in the summer it can take 15 minutes because everyone is driving five miles an hour on Bradford Street, which makes me crazy. I'm not a relaxed person -- it's my New York angst. I've discussed this in therapy multiple times.
HOLDING COURT We love the Provincetown Tennis Club. It's something out of a WASP-y New England Jane Austen novel. It's very social and friendly. I love doubles -- it's like a chess game filled with strategy. Sometimes we see Billie Jean King or Delia Ephron. I have a Wilson racket, which we spin to see who goes first by calling "wine" or "margarita." We play for the next 90 minutes. Then we sweep the courts, drive back home and scream at how slow everyone is.
ON THE SAND We change into our bathing suits and make sandwiches. Usually it's turkey and Provolone with lettuce, tomato and avocado on whole wheat. I like hot chili relish mayo; Elysa likes mustard. And Cape Cod "40 percent less fat" chips. We pack the newspaper, our Kindles, towels, chairs and umbrella, and drive to Herring Cove. It used to be gays to the left, straights to the right. Now the straights are in the gay area.
TIME FOR A DIP We set up and run into the ocean. It's a mystery why we both love the ocean so much. We've decided the beach and ocean are the only places we don't fight. We hug and swim and talk. The water is like glass. Then we have lunch. People who bump into us say hi and eat our Cape Cod chips.
PLEASURE READ Then I read. There's something about novels on the beach. It's all pleasure. I just finished "Daisy Jones & the Six" and have started "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo." Elysa just finished the Carole King biography. I eventually fall asleep with my mouth open and snore. By 5-ish we're packing up.
FOCUS ON JOKES Back home it's work mode. It's hard to communicate with me because I'm focused on what I'm doing that night on stage. There's a palpable shift. I sit with my notebook at the kitchen table and go through jokes, usually new ones I've written during the week and want to include. Then I shower, dress, get my face on and get my bag ready.
HEAD SPACE I ride my red Trek bike and enjoy the 10 minutes of solitary time to get into the right head. You would think getting on stage is no big deal, but I still have anxiety.
SECOND HOME The Post Office is a second home. Phyllis Schlossberg, who owned it, gave a lot of performers their start. I come minutes before a show starts because I don't like waiting around to go on. I sit at the bar and get a water; I don't drink before a set because I want every synapse of my brain working. If I have a new bit, I can't wait to get to it. The show is about what annoys me, like cancel culture, antisemitism, stupidity and turning 60.
TWO SCOOPS Elysa has come to the show, and since I can't eat a big meal before performing, and most restaurants are closed after 9:30 p.m. on a Sunday, we stop and get ice cream. I'm a traditionalist: two scoops -- one coffee with chocolate chunks, and the other is just chocolate, with chocolate sprinkles -- and a sugar cone. Elysa is very experimental with her food. She likes to try weird combos, like ginger molasses.
RIDE BACK After a show we bike home on Commercial Street, two old lesbians with their bells going off because everyone is in the middle of the street. At home we watch TV. We just watched the Mary Tyler Moore documentary, which I loved, and Netflix's "Eldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate," about queer Berlin in the '30s. I always say I'm going to stay up, then I fall asleep. Elysa looks at me to see if I'm asleep, and eventually says, "Judy, I'm going upstairs, let's go." Then I can't move. I stay on the couch, and get up at 1:30 or 2 a.m. and go upstairs and I'm out.

Do Supermodels Age, or Get Airbrushed Instead?: [Style Desk]

Full text: The cover of Vogue's September issue has ignited a new debate about beauty standards.
Well, hello there, Linda, Christy, Naomi and Cindy, the O.G. supermodels; women for whom the term was created; creatures who became so famous that they didn't even need last names, like Aretha or Marilyn. Back, once again, on the cover of the September issue of Vogue, that vestigial megalith from the magazine era, decades after you emerged. We've clearly missed you.
How else to interpret the fervid enthusiasm generated by the appearance of their new cover, a collaboration between American and British Vogue styled by Edward Enninful, photographed by Rafael Pavarotti and dropped on Instagram last week? The thousands of social media responses, the comments and clapping hands and fire emojis?
"More of this always and forever, please," wrote Karen Elson, the model, under Vogue's post, in a summary of the general reaction.
Yet beneath the chorus of love is another, growing strain of commentary that is slightly less enthralled. One focused on calling out what many viewers see as egregious age erasing: the promotion of women age 58 (Linda Evangelista), 57 (Cindy Crawford), 54 (Christy Turlington) and 53 (Naomi Campbell) as paragons of mature beauty whose years have seemingly been smoothed from their faces. Who look so retouched that they seem more like A.I.-generated bots than actual people.
According to a Vogue spokeswoman, there was only "minimal retouching and minimal lighting" on the photographs. But in a world where we are increasingly concerned about the blurred line between virtual reality and actual reality, where disinformation is rife, the definition of "minimal" and what exactly that means is a relative issue.
It casts an uneasy light over the whole shoot -- how much of it is real, how much Photoshop -- that doesn't serve anyone involved.
It doesn't serve the women on the cover, who broke through back in the day because they had character and were willing to show it; because they didn't want to be blank mannequins, as models had generally been before them, but individuals with personalities and attitudes and opinions of their own. The kind of personalities that involve expressions, which over time etch years and experiences -- joy, sorrow, laughter, fury -- onto the topography of a face.
And it doesn't serve the women who look to them as role models.
It is unquestionably positive that Vogue, a brand that still positions itself as the bible of fashion, even as its hold on that position seems increasingly tenuous, is putting women in the fullness of their life on its biggest cover of the year. Even if it's not exactly a surprise, given the swing to celebrity, the broader cultural fascination with the supermodel heyday of the 1990s, and the fact that the four women have an Apple TV+ documentary about their careers coming next month.
Indeed, there has been a move to exalting age in a variety of Vogues over the last year, with the model Carmen Dell'Orefice on the cover of Vogue Czechoslovakia at 91 and the tattoo artist Apo Whang-Od on the cover of Vogue Philippines at 106. But it seems more like a stunt -- OMG! Look, how she defies age! Or OMG! So old! -- rather than a real embrace of a more mature demographic. There are, after all, no nonfamous older models who appear regularly in the magazine.
And it is possible that the magazine is simply depicting the women as they want to be shown. In which case, fair enough. According to a Vogue spokeswoman, though, "Vogue retains final editorial control of the creative, fashion and video shoots that appear on any of its platforms."
Certainly, images of models at every age are retouched (sometimes ridiculously so). It is also true that, having seen Naomi Campbell in person, I can tell you that she does not have a line on her face. And there is no question that the former supes look extraordinary for their age.
But extraordinary is not the same thing as unbelievably perfect. When looking at photos of teenagers and 20-somethings, it is possible to delude yourself into accepting the impossibly flawless nature of what you see. Thirty years later, it's harder to pretend.
Which means it's hard not to think that here was a lost opportunity to embrace all of the hallmarks of our humanity, not to mention transparency about what we are faking (or not). Fixing a wrinkle here, some crow's-feet there, may seem like a little thing. But it's part of what chips away at our shared sense of truth.
In the videos that are embedded in the article, there is a slight frown line shadowing Christy Turlington's forehead. That is not surprising, given that she recently told Marie Claire: "Women who have stayed away from augmentation of themselves -- those are the women I really admire. I love seeing a real face."
As Cindy Crawford takes a selfie with her old friends, she has small but visible laugh lines; her forehead moves and eyes crinkle. These are part of being alive. Blanding out these expressive marks from the photographs, when they are still apparent elsewhere, makes the whole shoot seem more faked than it probably was.
After all, if anyone should understand the complexities of female aging in a society obsessed with youth, it is the women who represented the pinnacle of that youthful beauty.
Linda Evangelista has been public about her trauma with CoolSculpting, which she said left her disfigured. When she was on the cover of British Vogue in September 2022, she was open about how the makeup artist Pat McGrath used tape and her tools to "create fantasies" and erase reality.
In the current Vogue wide-ranging interview, Ms. Evangelista sort of tiptoes around the subject. "I want wrinkles," she said, "but I Botox my forehead, so I am a hypocrite. But I want to grow old." Yet it isn't addressed any further.
It's particularly ironic, coming just after the death of Jane Birkin, and the celebrations of her life and style, which were marked by a thrilling disregard for the pressure to play by any rules and a willingness to embrace her own wrinkles and the stories they told. (Ms. Turlington has name-checked Ms. Birkin as one of her own paragons of beauty.) That should have been a sign, if anyone cared to see it, of how eager we are for such unfiltered examples.
"The world puts a lot of pressure obviously on women as they age," Ms. Crawford says in a Vogue video. But, she continues, "we still can have fun, we can still be beautiful, we can still be visible."
So let them be visible, marks and all. They once were pioneers of a new kind of beauty. Here's hoping they will be again.

Help! JetBlue Left Our Boy Scout Troop Stranded at J.F.K.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: When their flight from Denver to J.F.K. was delayed, six scouts and three adults missed their connection back to Savannah, Ga., and had to make a choice: Wait five days or find their own way home.
Dear Tripped Up,
I was one of three adults who led a backpacking trip to the Colorado Rockies this past June with six teenage Boy Scouts from Troop 876 of Savannah, Ga. After seven nights camping, our eighth night -- June 26 -- was to be aboard a redeye to Kennedy Airport, followed by a morning flight to Savannah, both on JetBlue Airways. But our Denver departure was delayed over two hours and we missed the connection. We waited for three hours in line, only to politely be told the next flight available was five days later, even after we offered to fly to Atlanta, Charleston, S.C., or Jacksonville, Fla., instead. JetBlue would not provide a hotel. So we opted for a refund (plus $ 12 meal vouchers), rented two cars and drove 14 hours home, racking up about $ 1,200 in travel expenses. But when our refunds from JetBlue came through, they totaled $ 261 for nine of us, only 18 percent of the original cost. A customer service representative later explained to me by phone that we had been reimbursed for only the New York to Savannah leg. We believe JetBlue should have gotten us on an earlier flight on a different airline or at least reimbursed us for the nine fares and fees totaling $ 1,458, and perhaps chipped in for the expenses to get home. Can you help? Spencer, Savannah, Ga.
Dear Spencer,
Phew! I thought you were going to ask me how to feed six growing Boy Scouts on $ 12 meal vouchers at an airport food court.
You had every right to receive a full flight refund from JetBlue Airways. The Transportation Department requires airlines to offer refunds if flights are "significantly delayed," regardless of reason, and the federal policy contains no detectable clause allowing JetBlue to reimburse a laughably tiny percentage of the original cost. Derek Dombrowski, a spokesman for the airline, admitted that JetBlue erred here, and told me that someone would reach out to you. You reported back that a representative called and apologetically agreed to credit you the full $ 1,458, throwing in nine $ 100 vouchers for future travel.
As Mr. Dombrowski later explained to me in an email: "Our policy in this circumstance -- where a customer is not rebooked after a canceled flight or due to a missed connection out of the customer's control -- is a full refund provided to the original form of payment for the entire one-way journey."
"We apologize for this error," he wrote.
But it sounds more like two errors to me. When you originally saw the paltry reimbursement, you called JetBlue and they doubled down with the sketchy single-leg explanation. (And even then, how was a single leg worth only $ 29?) I do hope that JetBlue will adhere more closely to its policy in the future.
The airline appears to be right on the rest. You were not likely entitled to those hotel rooms or even to an earlier flight on a different airline.
That is because on June 26, thunderstorms caused thousands of delays and cancellations in the Northeast. Earlier in the day, according to data from Flightaware.com, the aircraft that you would eventually take from Denver spent over eight hours on the J.F.K. tarmac, likely grounded by storms. It took off two hours late for a flight to Denver that evening, in turn delaying your flight. That meant your flight delay was "uncontrollable," confirmed Mr. Dombrowski, meaning it was not the fault of the airline -- a category that also includes security-line backups, air traffic control problems and other issues.
If the delay had been the result of, say, an airline staffing shortage or mechanical issue, that would count as a "controllable delay," and you would have been offered a hotel stay.
Massive storms are one thing. But sometimes just how "uncontrollable" a delay is can get murky. Many a frequent flier can recount a time when an airline informed passengers of a "weather-related delay" on a perfect day for picnicking at both the airport of origin and destination. That is because with some planes flying a half-dozen or more legs daily with self-imposed tight turnaround times, weather anywhere can cause a delay anywhere else. And guess who gets to decide whether the delay was controllable? The airlines themselves.
I crunched some numbers from the Transportation Department's monthly Air Travel Consumer Reports and found that of all the delays in the first four months of 2023, the latest data available, just one-third -- 157,485 of 471,608 -- were deemed "air carrier delays," defined as "due to circumstances within the airline's control."
"It is not always easy for the consumer to know whether an airline is to blame for a flight delay or cancellation," wrote Ethan Alpern, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, in a detailed email answering my questions about how airlines determine delays. Extreme weather, national aviation system issues and security delays are just a few official categories.
The tables of statistics that the government publishes in those reports is pretty confusing. For example, airlines often claim a delay is the result of "late arriving aircraft," which means it is not officially an "air carrier delay," although, according to Mr. Alpern, half of those delays are the fault of the airline.
There is potential good news on the horizon: One month before your trip, the Transportation Department announced a rule-making process that will better clarify what counts as a controllable delay. There is no precise timeline when that's rolling out, but in the meantime, anyone who suspects an airline may have called a delay uncontrollable when it was actually the airline's fault are encouraged to register a complaint, said Mr. Alpern. (The department looks into every complaint and contacts the airline when necessary, he noted.)
Information on just what airlines will provide in the case of controllable delays can now be found easily with the Transportation Department's "Cancellation and Delay Dashboard," on which 10 of the largest carriers in the United States make explicit their commitments for rebooking, lodging, ground transportation and so on for stuck passengers. The dashboard also links to specifics for each airline.
For controllable delays, JetBlue is one of five of those 10 airlines that has committed to book passengers on a partner airline when necessary. According to your story, JetBlue officials did attempt to book your group on American Airlines, even though they didn't have to in these circumstances, so kudos to them. Alas, JetBlue's code-share agreement with American ended on July 21, so future Boy Scout troops (and other passengers) might not be afforded the same largess.
This brings up yet another murky issue: There is no official or public list of airline partnerships, according to Mr. Alpern. Mr. Dombrowski of JetBlue declined to answer my question about whether the carrier has any other agreements with airlines that would allow rebooking for controllable (and sometimes uncontrollable) delays.
Finally, those $ 100 vouchers were also a nice touch, but I imagine you would much rather prefer reimbursements for your car rental and related expenses. Well, let's put it this way: N.B.A. players are more likely to find sufficient leg room in coach than delayed passengers are to be reimbursed for expenses that are not preapproved in writing. Most airlines make that clear in the contract of carriage you agree to when you book a flight.
The only thing that could have saved you here is (tepid drum roll please) -- travel insurance.
That is why I had you check which credit card you had used to book the trip, hoping it was one of the fancier ones, like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or American Express Platinum cards, that include a trip delay benefit. It was not. For future trips, you might want to consider buying trip-delay coverage. Just read my recent column on travel insurance for more bad news before you do.

Iran Arrests 12 Proponents Of the Rights Of Women: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: They stand accused of planning to incite "chaos and vandalism" nearly a year after a young woman's death in Iranian police custody sparked a mass rebellion.
In a sweeping operation ahead of an important anniversary, the Iranian authorities have detained at least 12 rights activists, all but one of them women, over the past two days, human rights groups and Iranian media have reported.
A year ago next month, Iran was convulsed in demonstrations and riots following the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by the country's morality police after officers accused her of wearing her state-mandated religious veil too loosely. Hundreds were killed in the ensuing government crackdown, including at least 44 minors, while around 20,000 Iranians were arrested, the United Nations calculated.
The arrested activists were rounded up in cities across Iran's northern Gilan Province, according to HRANA, an Iranian human rights organization. The detentions signaled that the Iranian government "is trying to get ahead of any possible protests that might be organized to commemorate the one-year anniversary," said Sanam Vakil, who directs the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, the London-based think tank.
On Thursday, Iranian officials accused the 12 detainees of planning to incite "chaos and vandalism" on the upcoming anniversary of Ms. Amini's death, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported. According to Fars, which has close ties to the country's security agencies, the officials also accused the activists of being funded by foreign intelligence and collaborating with Iran International, an opposition television channel based in Washington.
After her arrest last year, Ms. Amini, who came from Kurdistan Province in northwestern Iran, died under suspicious circumstances in a Tehran hospital, prompting months of protests by Iranians, many of whom saw her death as emblematic of the heavy-handed and repressive nature of the Islamic Republic.
The outrage was stoked by a photo and video of Ms. Amini that circulated widely on social media showing her lying unconscious on a hospital bed with tubes in her mouth and nose, blood oozing from her ear and bruises around her eyes.
The widespread unrest marked the most serious challenge to the Islamic Republic since another wave of anti-government demonstrations in 2009, prompted by accusations of widespread election fraud.
Iranian opposition activists say pressure from the authorities has been building as the anniversary of Ms. Amini's death on Sept. 16 last year has approached. Numerous activists -- even those who have managed to stay out of jail -- have been summoned by state intelligence and warned not to demonstrate at the one-year mark, said Shiva Nazarahari, an Iranian women's rights activist who lives in Slovenia.
Everyone "from Instagram bloggers to university students" are now feeling the pressure, Ms. Nazarahari said.
Police rearrested a student journalist, Nazila Maroufian, on Monday, just a day after she was released on bail, according to HRANA. Ms. Maroufian published an interview with Ms. Amini's father, Amjad, last October in which he accused the Iranian government of lying about his daughter's death.
On Wednesday, an Iranian court sentenced two filmmakers, Saeed Roustaee and Javad Noruzbegi, to six months in prison for "participating in the opposition's propaganda against the Islamic regime" over their movie "Leila's Children," the Iranian news site Etemad reported.
The two will serve nine days in prison with the remaining sentence suspended for five years, according to Etemad. They will also be barred from engaging with other members of the film industry.
Omid Memarian, an analyst at Democracy for the Arab World, a U.S.-based advocacy group, said the uptick in security operations reflects "the authorities' concerns about a new round of protests" despite the largely successful crackdown.
"The energy, anger and frustration are there, and once there is an opening, it will come to the surface," said Mr. Memarian.

Will Matildas Madness Spin Into More Passion For Women's Sports?: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Australian fans are mourning their team's semifinal defeat at the Women's World Cup. Beyond the ache, there are concerns about whether the support for women's sports will last.
The morning after Australia's dream run at the Women's World Cup ended one win short of the final, Denisse Lopez, 34, found a quiet spot to sit in Darling Harbour. She was still wearing the Sam Kerr jersey she had put on for Australia's semifinal loss to England the night before. She carried a book and a croissant, a type of pastry she had denied herself, because of its origins, until her team had beaten France in the quarterfinals.
Betrayed by her puffy eyes, Lopez admitted she had been crying. She had attended all of Australia's matches in this World Cup, starting with their first group stage contest four weeks earlier, using airline miles to follow the Matildas up and down the country's east coast. So strong was her belief in the team that she had secured tickets to the final but not the third-place match in Brisbane, where Australia will play Sweden on Saturday.
"It just came out this morning," Lopez, who lives in Melbourne, said of her tears. "The players started posting about the loss, and I was like, 'Oh, I'm sad.' Mostly, I feel flat and disappointed for the girls. But, you know, there's one more game."
Hosting the tournament along with New Zealand, Australia was a cauldron of complex emotions after the hometown team fell shy of the outcome that many Australians did not know they wanted so badly until it came so close to happening. Disappointment was mixed with pride, but there was also some uncertainty about whether there would be the fan and institutional support needed to sustain Matildas fever beyond this quadrennial tournament being held on their home soil.
This is a sports-mad country, but not necessarily a soccer-mad one. The Daily Telegraph, a local tabloid, cited a survey taken before the World Cup that said most Australians could not recognize any Matildas players besides Kerr, the team captain and star striker. Surely that is no longer the case, as breakout players like goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold and forward Mary Fowler have become instantly recognizable through countless on-field close-ups. Thursday morning in Darling Harbour, fans approached Cortnee Vine, the substitute who scored the winning penalty kick in the quarterfinal, for a selfie as she appeared to be out for a walk with family members.
But Kerr's plea, in the aftermath of a defeat that left her in tears, that her sport receive the kind of funding that is devoted to the Australian Football League or the National Rugby League was a reminder that there is no guarantee that this moment has permanence. Australia Coach Tony Gustavsson had referred to this as a "crossroads moment" for the country's investment in women's soccer to match that of some of its top opponents, such as England.
Perhaps similarly recognizing the fragility of the bond between Australians and their Matildas, midfielder Katrina Gorry urged supporters not to jump off the bandwagon. And just 14 hours after more than 75,000 fans packed Stadium Australia in Sydney for the semifinal against England, the Matildas asked fans on social media not to forget that they still had one more match.
Rana Hussain, a Melbourne-based inclusion and belonging specialist in sports, said the tension around what happens next contributed to her heartbreak as she lingered in the stadium after the final whistle on Wednesday night, not wanting the magic to be over.
"It's the fear that we go back to the old normal, especially after having a taste of what life feels like when we do fund and invest in women's sport and what it does look like when the crowds turn up and to see that it's possible," she said in a phone interview. "We all kind of are holding our breath waiting to see, do we go back to business as usual? Or is this really the line in the sand that we're all saying it is and hoping it is?"
Hussain wrote on social networks that Australia would never look back after this run, which she admitted was as much to reassure herself as anything. She also encouraged fans to continue supporting Matildas players as they disperse to their club teams, sometimes in other countries, a common obstacle to sustained support after major international tournaments.
The morning papers on Thursday predicted staying power. The lead headline of The Australian declared, "Dream Kerr-tailed but national love affair's just begun." The front page of The Telegraph asserted that despite the loss, "our girls in green and gold have changed the nation's sporting landscape forever."
The semifinal broadcast reached 11.15 million Australians, more than 40 percent of the population, according to ratings figures released by OzTAM, Australia's audience measurement source. The national average audience of more than seven million, which does not include viewers at pubs or other venues, made the game the most-watched television program since the measurement system began in 2001.
Because women's sports were born of exclusion, said Kasey Symons, a research fellow with the Sport Innovation Research Group at Swinburne University in Melbourne, they often generate a more welcoming and inclusive fan culture. She saw that happen during this World Cup, and said the passion of new fans contributed to the emotional hangover that she too was working through on Thursday morning.
"I think a lot of people are trying to navigate some feelings they don't really know too well," Symons said in a phone interview. "There's just this really overwhelming sense of validation that women in sport has value, and people have connected with that. So that's a really emotional experience to see that and feel part of it, and that sense of belonging I think is a really important part of this."
In Darling Harbour, the FIFA fan festival was closed on Thursday, but Clare Roden, 46, a teacher who lives a two-hour drive down the coast, was asking a security guard for information about getting in on Saturday to watch the Matildas. She bought a ticket to the final last October, not thinking her team would be in it -- but over the last week she started to believe it would happen. She still plans to go to the final between England and Spain, painful as it may be, but first needed to lock down her viewing plans for the third-place match.
Lopez was hoping to make the trip up to Brisbane. After all, she had been at every other Matildas match this tournament.
She is a newer fan who began watching soccer during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, when pandemic-related restrictions in Melbourne kept her home. Australia's win over Britain in the Olympic quarterfinals got her hooked, and as an immigrant from the Philippines, she felt connected to a game that is international. She began attending the Matildas' friendly matches, some with crowds a fraction of what she saw during this tournament, and bought the FIFA 23 video game because Kerr was on the cover.
Even after the agonizing defeat, Lopez found solace in rewatching the moment that had given the home crowd a final surge of hope: Kerr crossing the midfield line with the ball, gaining steam as she drove forward and then delivering a strike from over 25 yards out. Lopez posted a clip of that goal to Instagram with a caption to which most of Australia could relate: "Mentally we're still here."

Five Lessons To Learn From 'Barbie': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Buchanan, Kyle

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If studios greenlight more movies about toys, they'll be missing the point. Greta Gerwig's hit is about smart filmmaking, not brand awareness.
Over the past week and a half, Greta Gerwig's comedy "Barbie" passed the billion-dollar mark at the global box office, and it won't be long before it overtakes "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" to become 2023's highest-grossing movie worldwide -- a title it's likely to hold onto. That's a staggering achievement in so many ways: No movie directed by a woman has ever topped the yearly box office, and it's been well over two decades since a live-action film without any significant action elements became the biggest movie of the year. (That'd be the Jim Carrey vehicle "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," which ruled 2000.)
But can the runaway success of "Barbie" reshape Hollywood? I'm too cynical to think studio executives will learn all the right lessons from it. Instead, they'll probably just greenlight more movies about toys. Still, "Barbie" proved at least five things to be true, if decision makers are willing to think outside the pink box.
1. A summer movie can be smartly written
We count on summer movies to deliver spectacle, but how many also come with a witty, thoughtful script? Too often, big-budget blockbusters are rushed into production before the screenplay is finished, and even while shooting, they're in a constant state of flux, with new writers clambering aboard to stitch everything into some sort of viable patchwork quilt.
"Barbie," by contrast, feels totally thought through instead of frantically rewritten. Despite the outsize scale of the film, it still shares a distinctive comic sensibility and offhand intellectualism with "Frances Ha" and "Mistress America," the two movies previously written by Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, and there are actual ideas at play here that have given "Barbie" a conversational shelf life far longer than most summer films. Though "Barbie" proves that a big movie can be both fun and thoughtful, that's likely to happen only when a studio hires smart writers, resists sanding down their sensibilities, and gives them enough time and space to truly make the story sing.
2. Make more female-led event films
Though movies as varied as "Bridesmaids," "Crazy Rich Asians" and "Where the Crawdads Sing" have all become breakout hits in recent years, they're often treated as aberrations: Peruse a typical theatrical calendar and you'll find little trace of those films' influence. Studio executives routinely take female audiences for granted, handing their biggest budgets to movies made by and starring men because the conventional wisdom is that though women will go see those titles, male moviegoers are reluctant to watch a female-driven story.
"Barbie" has now blown a hole in that argument. It isn't just that men had no choice but to see "Barbie," lest they be left out of the cultural conversation -- the film also demonstrated how women will show up in record-breaking numbers to watch something that truly speaks to them (often bringing friends and going a second or third time, too). Female-led blockbusters don't all have to star a superheroine: They can be comedies, romances or dramas based on best-selling books, as long as they're presented as major events.
3. Don't rely on past-their-prime franchises
"Barbie" will end this summer outdrawing every major sequel. That's in part because those franchises are so long in the tooth: We're on the seventh "Mission: Impossible" movie, the 10th "Fast and Furious" and the fifth "Indiana Jones." Younger audiences have no sense of ownership over those older series, and even longtime fans may be experiencing diminishing returns. If any lasting lesson can be drawn from the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon that sent both "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" soaring past their initial projections, it's that audiences are eager for big movies that feel genuinely new. Films that stoke their curiosity can be even more potent than old reliables.
4. A great soundtrack is effective marketing
Though studios will explore every possible method to market a movie -- from billboards to Instagram ads to Happy Meals at McDonald's -- there are few tie-ins as potent as a really killer soundtrack. We used to count on our big summer movies to deliver radio hits, but loaded soundtrack albums have become few and far between these days, despite films like "Black Panther" and "The Greatest Showman" amply demonstrating the boost a film can get from an album that people can't stop playing.
It's nice, then, that the "Barbie" soundtrack is filled with bops, like Dua Lipa's "Dance the Night" and "Barbie World" from Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice. Billie Eilish's "What Was I Made For?" is destined to make the shortlist for the original-song Oscar, and even Ryan Gosling's plaintive power ballad "I'm Just Ken" debuted on Billboard's Hot 100. In an era when TikTok has become a music-industry hitmaker and virality on that platform can rival any paid marketing push, a fun pop soundtrack like the one "Barbie" boasts is worth its weight in rose gold.

5. Stop saving the good stuff for the sequel
With "Barbie" on a path to become the year's highest-grossing movie worldwide, Warner Bros. will inevitably try to conjure a franchise from it. Yet much of what makes "Barbie" feel fresh is that it tells a complete story and doesn't spend time setting up spinoffs or sequels. In fact, it ends in a place that would be hard to roll back: with its lead at the definitive end of her character arc. Gerwig and her stars aren't signed for "Barbie" sequels, and when I spoke to Gerwig after her blockbuster opening weekend, she said she'd put every idea she had into this movie without the thought of doing more: "At this moment, it's all I've got."
A "Barbie" sequel would certainly make money, but there's no way it could capture the lightning-in-a-bottle moment that makes this movie feel like such a collector's item. Would Warner Bros. and Mattel have the guts to preserve the value of "Barbie" by letting it stand on its own? As a top-tier legacy title undiluted by shoddy sequels, it could continue to generate untold amounts of revenue in the years to come. So although it's unlikely that studio heads will ever choose common sense over cynical cash grabs, the idea of "Barbie" as a one-and-done deserves consideration: After all, a toy only lasts forever if you know when to put it away.

Zuckerberg Plans to 'Move On' From 'Cage Fight' With Musk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, wrote on his Threads platform that Elon Musk did not seem "serious" about the much-ballyhooed match.
The will-they-or-won't-they drama between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg over a potential "cage fight" appeared on Sunday to end with a whimper, as Mr. Zuckerberg said that Mr. Musk's delays and excuses had rendered the discussion moot.
In a post to his nascent social-networking platform, Threads, Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, wrote, "I think we can all agree Elon isn't serious and it's time to move on." He included the hint of a taunt, "If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me."
Mr. Zuckerberg's message seemingly ended the suspense around a stranger-than-fiction summer of tension between the technology titans. Less than two months ago, Mr. Musk mused that he was "up for a cage match." That was just before Instagram, owned by Meta, introduced Threads as a competitor to Mr. Musk's Twitter (now renamed "X").
Whether or not he was serious at the time, intermediaries between the men began sketching out the contours of a match. Both executives continued to fan the flames; Mr. Zuckerberg posted photographs of himself shirtless in training, and Mr. Musk said in posts on X that the event could happen in Italy.
As is common with Mr. Musk -- who has a history of public pronouncements that don't come to fruition -- momentum toward a match came in spurts. In posts, Mr. Musk said the date of the fight was "in flux" because he needed an M.R.I. scan of his neck and back.
On Friday, Mr. Musk posted that the fight would be managed by the two men's foundations, and that he had spoken to the Italian government about a location. He did not list a date, saying only that he needed "minor surgery" to address his shoulder and ribs that he said would involve a recovery of several months.
Before Mr. Zuckerberg's remarks on Sunday, Mr. Musk posted to X a screengrab that he said was a conversation between the two men, showing Mr. Zuckerberg pressing Mr. Musk to commit.
Mr. Zuckerberg, in his Sunday post on Threads, nodded to the delays, writing, "Elon won't confirm a date, then says he needs surgery and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead."
He added, "I'm going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously."

'Big Brother' Contestant Is Expelled for Using Racial Slur: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: "Well, I'm in trouble now," Luke Valentine said after using a slur for Black people in a conversation on the reality show.
"Big Brother," CBS's long-running reality competition, has kicked off a contestant for using a racial slur.
The contestant, Luke Valentine, used a slur for Black people this week while chatting with other men in the compound where houseguests are filmed 24 hours a day as they compete for a large cash prize. Valentine is white, and one of the other men in the conversation is Black.
The incident, broadcast during the show's live online feed, was addressed on Thursday night's episode, in which highlights from the feed are interspersed with contestants' reflections on recent events in the house.
"It's been an emotional 24 hours in the 'Big Brother' house as the houseguests learned that one of their own broke the 'Big Brother' code of conduct and was removed from the game," the show's longtime host, Julie Chen Moonves, said during the episode.
After Valentine, an illustrator from Florida, used the slur, he immediately apologized to the three other men in the room and tried to backtrack. Clearly shocked, two of the men quickly left. Jared Fields, who is Black, mostly stayed quiet but responded to Valentine by saying that the slur can make white people more uncomfortable than Black people.
"Well, I'm in trouble now," Valentine said to Fields.
In an interview aired on Thursday's episode, Fields said: "My nonreaction in the moment, being the only Black male in this house, I don't know what to say. Anything I say or do can come across wrong or aggressive."
"I don't associate ignorance with malice," he later added.
On an Instagram account that is followed by verified accounts of other "Big Brother" contestants, Valentine posted an apology to his story, along with a photo of himself and a prayer hands emoji. "Luke made a big mistake," it read, "please forgive him."
Andy Herren, the show's Season 15 winner, said CBS did the right thing by expelling Valentine. "YEARS of problematic behavior and language in the Big Brother house going unpunished led to fans and former houseguests speaking up," Herren posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. He added, "This is huge and will change things moving forward!"
"Big Brother," now in its 25th season, has a history of racism among its contestants.
In 2019, shortly before winning Season 21, Jackson Michie was asked on live television to answer for accusations that some of his behavior during the season had been racist and sexist. He defended himself in the moment but later apologized, admitting blame. Aaryn Gries, a Season 15 contestant, was questioned by Chen Moonves after being filmed making racist and homophobic remarks.
Black contestants have also struggled to advance on "Big Brother," often getting voted out early. The show's first Black winner, Xavier Prather, was not crowned until Season 23. The next season featured the show's first Black female winner, Taylor Hale.
"It was something I was cognizant of," Prather told The New York Times this year. "I am a 6-2, 200-pound athletic Black man -- I can't approach the game the same way that a slim, 5-10 white man can, because we're perceived differently."
"To assume that I could approach the game the same way would be to assume that I could approach life the same way," he continued. "'Big Brother' is literally a reflection of our society."

Religious Ritual Turns Political, Extending Protests in Iran: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ashura, which mourns the killing of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson and celebrates Shiite identity, has long symbolized the fight against oppression. This year, its chants have been turned against the government.
The large crowd of men congregated at the center of a mosque in the central city of Yazd, clad in black and beating their chests rhythmically in unison. They were commemorating Ashura, Shiite Islam's most sacred ritual, showcased annually with great fanfare in Iran as a testament to the Shiite theocracy's power and strength.
But this year Ashura looked different. The mourners who gathered in Yazd last month and in many other cities across Iran diverged unexpectedly from the script to target the clerical rulers of Iran, turning religious ballads into protest songs about the suffering of Iranians.
"For a city in ruins, for all of us held hostage, for the grieving mothers, for the tears of the marginalized," the men sang, according to videos. "We are mourning thousands of innocent lives, we are ashamed of this raging fire. Oh rain, oh storm, come. They have set fire to our tent."
In Kermanshah, a Kurdish city in western Iran, a religious vocalist known as a maddah stood on the street, microphone in hand, singing about officials "stealing and devouring" resources away from desolate people.
And in Dezful, a small conservative city in the southwest, a similar vocalist delivered a scathing sermon against the government as the crowd marched in a ritual procession.
"Oh, my country, do you know why I'm grieving? Their only concern is hijab. They don't see the blood, the poverty. They are stealing the public's money," serenaded the vocalist, Ibrahim Nassrollahi. "Fathers are ashamed, mothers are suffering. I wish they would see our poverty."
Instead of the traditional chant that describes an ancient tale of grief, the crowd shouted back: "Iran, Iran, Iran!"
It was a surprising tone for the period of religious mourning known as Muharram, which lasts for a little over a month in Iran. This year it will end on Sept. 6, with another big public ritual called Arbaeen that is expected to also become a platform for protest.
Ashura, which marks the 10th day of the mourning period, grieves for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who was beheaded in the year 680 in the battle of Karbala. Imam Hussein led an uprising against the succession of Islam's new caliph, Yazid, on the basis that his rule was corruption and unjust, and in Karbala his small force was confronted by Yazid's massive army and slaughtered.
For centuries Ashura has been more than just a religious ritual. From Iran, to Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and beyond, it has served as a celebration of Shiite Muslim identity. Even some secular people participate in its stylized rituals, ranging from street processions to theatrical re-enactments and food handouts organized by neighborhood committees.
Social and political movements in the Muslim world have long been fueled and inspired by the narrative of Ashura, of the oppressed rising up against an oppressor. In Iran during the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy, a huge protest on Ashura became a turning point against the Shah. During the country's Green Movement in 2009, protesters, mostly young and upper middle class, took to the streets on Ashura to contest presidential election results.
Under Saddam Hussein's rule, Iraqi Shiites were banned from publicly commemorating their mourning holidays. The Taliban government in Afghanistan recently announced a similar ban.
In previous years, maddahs in Iran occasionally delivered sermons with mild and indirect criticism of the government. This year, some of the ceremonies were the traditional grand spectacles and religious processions.
But the widespread and remarkable politicization of Ashura directly targeting the leaders of the Islamic Republic rattled the authorities, who warned that the protest tone was "making our enemies happy." There were reports on social media of the brief detention of some of the leading vocalists and demands from the government that they tone down their rhetoric.
"The enemy had unpleasant dreams for Muharram this year," Mohammad Mehdi Esmaili, Iran's minister of Islamic guidance and culture, said on Monday. "They wanted to turn Muharram into the latest battlefield, but our people did not listen at all."
But analysts said that instead of issuing fanciful denials, the government must reckon with the stark reality that opposition to it has now spread to some devoutly religious Iranians, who were once considered a loyal power base. The rebellion on display presents yet another challenge to the legitimacy of a theocracy that views itself as the global spiritual leader of Shiite Muslims.
Mohamad Ali Ahangaran, a conservative analyst of religion and the son of a prominent maddah who performs at government events, said in an interview from Tehran that many Iranians were using every opportunity, including Ashura, to voice their opposition to the status quo.
"This year we saw the religious sermons and songs become more protest-driven than previous years, targeting the way the leaders are governing Iran, the widespread corruption in the Islamic Republic, the political obstacles we face," Mr. Ahangaran said.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly encouraged Muharram ceremonies to be more political and take sides, but he never envisioned that in doing so it would one day turn "against the entire leadership" of Iran, including himself, said Mr. Ahangaran.
Nearly a year ago, Iranians took to the streets in nationwide protests demanding an end to the clerical government. The uprising was set off by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police, who had detained her on allegations of violating the mandatory hijab law. The government responded with violence, killing over 500 people, including children, arresting tens of thousands and executing seven protesters.
"We saw the story of Ashura unfold in the streets with our own eyes as they slaughtered our youth last year," said Maryam, 55, a mother of two in Tehran, who asked that her last name not be used, fearing retribution. "As a religious person, I want to completely separate myself from any ceremony connected to the regime."
Maryam said her mother hosted a mourning ceremony at home early this month for nearly 200 guests. She adorned the salon with black Ashura flags with Imam Hussein's name and placed a picture of a killed protester next to each flag. "They are our new martyrs," she said.
The 33-year-old son of a senior cleric in the religious city of Qom said that he was boycotting the Muharram ceremonies because of his opposition to the government and its violence. His relatives, he said, searched for ceremonies that either were not political or took on the regime. He also requested anonymity, fearing for his safety.
Some Iranians wore white, in defiance of the customary black attire, and trekked to cemeteries to pay homage to killed protesters. In the northern city of Amol, a religious marching band dressed in white went to the home of Ghazalleh Chelavi, 33, a female athlete shot in the head during protests last September, videos showed. Her mother wailed by the door.
In Yazd, the maddah led the crowd in singing a famous poem that honors protesters killed by governments: "From the blood of our country's youth, tulips grow."
Then, comparing the authorities in power to wheels, they continued, "Oh, wheel, how you have derailed, how you misbehave, how you take revenge. Oh, wheel, you have no religion and no principles."
Ms. Amini's mother posted a video on Instagram of her daughter's grave illuminated by candlelight at night on Ashura. A woman's voice could be heard singing the same poem.

What's 'Skiplagging'? Staying at a Layover. Airlines Are Not Fans.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Booking a flight with a layover in the city that's the real destination for the traveler can net big bargains, but airlines prohibit the practice.
On the last day of June, American Airlines agents at Gainesville Regional Airport in Florida canceled a North Carolina teenager's flight after realizing that he had used a booking tactic called "skiplagging" or "hidden-city travel," forbidden by airlines but used by some travelers to net flight bargains.
The teen's father, Hunter Parsons, said it was his 17-year-old's first time flying unaccompanied and that both the timing and price of the booking made it appealing -- for $ 150, his son was to fly from Gainesville to Charlotte, and not continue on the second flight to New York, a cost savings of roughly $ 300 if the family had simply purchased a direct flight to Charlotte. But Mr. Parsons's son didn't even make it past the check-in counter in Gainesville, where the airline agents questioned why the teen would fly to New York when his layover was in his hometown, Charlotte. He was forced to pay for a direct flight.
Skiplagging is buying a ticket for a connecting flight, with a layover in the city that's the real destination for the traveler. Flyers disembark after the first leg and simply fail to board the second. Often the fare is cheaper than if they'd actually bought a direct flight to their desired destination. At least two websites now help unearth these deals for consumers.
Though it is not illegal, the practice is strictly prohibited by airlines in their contracts of carriage. And carriers have shown an erratic but heavy hand in administering punishment for those caught, eliminating a skiplagger's frequent flier miles in one instance and suing a passenger in another. Mr. Parsons said that American barred his son from traveling with the carrier for three years.
Experts say that travelers have flown this way for decades and that detecting improper use of connections is tricky, making enforcement a challenge for airlines. Here's what to know about this open secret of flying.
How does it work?
Airline ticket costs are determined by many factors, such as energy prices, passenger demand for certain routes and competition from other airlines. They aren't merely a reflection of travel distance. For travelers, this means that it can occasionally be more affordable to book a flight with a layover along a more competitive route and get off there, rather than booking a nonstop flight to the desired location.
For instance, a traveler in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., wants to fly to San Francisco. A recent search turned up a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Portland, Ore., with a stop in San Francisco, for about $ 124. A nonstop flight from Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco would cost about $ 220.
Skiplagged and Kiwi facilitate searching for and booking these kinds of deals.
But it requires staying undetected. You can't check a bag or link a frequent flier account to collect the mileage. And travelers who show patterns -- flying the same routes repeatedly and missing the last leg of a flight -- are more likely to be caught.
Why is it gaining in popularity?
Short answer: the cost of airfare, which has soared in recent years.
Mary Cropper, a travel specialist with Boston-based Audley Travel, called airfare pricing a "perfect storm." Rising fares, in addition to fees for everything from beverages to printing boarding passes, have made skiplagging more enticing to passengers. While she doesn't advise her clients to book this way, she said she understood the motivation.
"Why wouldn't someone want to save 50 percent on an airline ticket, something that's just so expensive these days?" Ms. Cropper asked.
Aktarer Zaman, Skiplagged's founder and chief executive, emphasized that his website has "empowered people to make their own decisions" by digging up alternatives to current airline pricing practices, which he described as "price gouging."
What are the risks?
Upon purchasing a ticket, travelers agree to a contract of carriage with the airline, which is a set of rules passengers agree to comply with. These cover everything from how a carrier will handle oversold flights to requirements regarding passengers' clothing and behavior. These terms and conditions also often explicitly forbid hidden-city ticketing and lay out a raft of consequences should travelers circumvent the rules.
United Airlines reserves the right to permanently ban travelers who don't complete their trip. They also say they can revoke status and wipe out accrued mileage. Alaska Airlines mentions that it can take legal action against passengers who violate their policies.
American says in its fine print that it has the right to a number of actions, such as canceling any unused portion of the ticket, refusing to let the passenger fly and billing the customer for what the intended route would have cost.
Curtis Blessing, a spokesman for American, called this type of travel an "all-around bad outcome" that could cause issues with checked bags and also prevent other customers, who might have urgent travel needs, from booking seats.
Airlines have mostly taken aim at the online providers, in past years filing a handful of lawsuits against Skiplagged and Kiwi. Earlier this summer, American sued Kiwi in federal court in Texas, claiming that the "rogue online travel agent" had repeatedly engaged in "abusive ticketing practices," including booking hidden city fares for its customers, according to court documents.
So far, litigation has been unsuccessful in blocking this travel hack. One lawsuit filed in 2014 by United against Skiplagged was dismissed, while in 2021, Southwest Airlines sued Skiplagged for using the carrier's data. Skiplagged argued that they were not the ones actually distributing Southwest tickets; they showed flights but directed users to other websites for booking. Both parties later agreed to drop the lawsuit, Mr. Zaman said.
In 2018, Lufthansa sued a passenger who had booked a round-trip flight from Oslo to Seattle but then stayed in Frankfurt, the flight's layover city. The airline later dropped the lawsuit.
However, there are plentiful anecdotes online of passengers who say they've been threatened with lifetime bans and with the loss of all their frequent flier mileage.
Is it an ethical way to travel? How much of an issue is it for airlines anyway?
"The question is whether you think it has any impact on the provider and whether you care," said Robert Mann, an aviation analyst and a former American executive. Airlines say that exploitation of hidden-city fares results in empty seats that could have been booked by others.
In its lawsuit against Kiwi, American also said that passenger no-shows can delay flights by triggering searches for the traveler and any luggage involved, and waste fuel that is calculated by passenger count.
Others say that these fares are a loophole of an airline's own making, and a reflection of their pricing priorities. By law, airlines can set whatever prices and routes they want.
"It can be argued charging much higher prices for shorter distances is unfair and especially penalizes frequent fliers to hub cities," where high demand generally means costlier airfare, said Paul Hudson, the founder of a passengers rights advocacy group called Flyers Rights.
What can you do if you're penalized for skiplagging?
Very little. Bart Banino, an attorney at Condon & Forsyth, a firm specializing in aviation law, emphasized that passengers are obligated to adhere to the airline's terms and conditions -- that contract of carriage -- whether that means traveling on the route they've purchased, or paying a fare difference when they're caught breaking the rules.
Mr. Hudson cited a past Supreme Court ruling that found that carriers have the right to claw back frequent flier miles, for whatever reason.

John Barrett, New York Hairdresser the Stars Flocked to See, Dies at 66: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His salon on the penthouse level of Bergdorf Goodman drew regulars like Martha Stewart, Princess Diana, Ethel Kennedy and Hillary Clinton.
John Barrett, a hairdresser whose relaxed wit, scissor-sharp style and long line of A-list clients put him literally on top of the luxury fashion world, with a salon spanning the penthouse level of the Bergdorf Goodman department store, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 66.
The death, at NYU Langone hospital, was confirmed by Jeffrey Seller, a close friend, who said the cause was complications of blood cancer.
New York has no shortage of places where clients can spend $ 200 or more on a snip and a blow dry. But for more than 20 years -- from in 1996, when Mr. Barrett opened at Bergdorf, to 2019, when he left to open his own salon -- his aerie overlooking Central Park was the destination of choice for the fashionable elite, whether they walked over from Park Avenue or flew in from Miami, Los Angeles or London.
He did hair for attendees of the annual Met Gala, the leading ladies of the British stage and all three female leads of the television show "Friends." Princess Diana, Ethel Kennedy and Hillary Clinton were regulars. He was the unofficial stylist for the staff of Vogue magazine; as a welcome gift, the editors would buy new hires a makeover at Mr. Barrett's salon.
Mr. Barrett was at his height in the mid-2000s, when the power-blonde look cultivated by the uptown salons helped define Upper East Side fashion.
"Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue were just lined with these power salons from the most major hairstyling stars in the world," Sarah Brown, a former editor at Vogue who is now an executive director at the beauty retailer Violet Grey, said in a phone interview. "And John Barrett was at the top of the heap."
A visit to Mr. Barrett's salon was more than just a hair appointment. He was among the first stylists to offer a one-stop beauty shop, with manicures, pedicures and makeup services -- and all of them were the best in town.
What might be a visit of an hour, tops, at another salon could stretch into a half day at Mr. Barrett's, which, with its relaxed atmosphere and foamy cappuccinos, could at times feel more like a highbrow social gathering than a beauty parlor.
"When you were there, you felt like you've been on vacation," Julianne Jaffe, a close friend and a longtime regular, said by phone.
Friends were made, gossip was traded, interviews were conducted. You might find yourself seated between the columnist Peggy Noonan and the homemaking expert Martha Stewart -- though a few sensitive regulars, like Mrs. Clinton, might opt for the semi-privacy of wheel-mounted screens.
Plum Sykes, a writer, recalled being sent to Mr. Barrett's salon on assignment soon after arriving in New York from Britain to work at Vogue.
"It was there that I learned about all the kinds of ins and outs of being New York perfect," she said in an interview. She later memorialized that look in the title of her 2004 novel, "Bergdorf Blondes."
Though his name was gold among the city's fashionable elite, Mr. Barrett eschewed what he considered the domineering, ego-driven salon culture of the 1980s and '90s. And though he had firm opinions about style, he offered a laid-back, even minimalist approach to cutting hair.
"If anything, people think I haven't changed them enough," he told the British newspaper The Independent in 1998. "But I can give them the best cut in the world and it will last longer than the one they had."
John Francis Barrett was born on Jan. 10, 1957, in Limerick, Ireland, the son of John Barrett, a laborer, and Philomena (Maroney) Barrett, a homemaker.
He was one of 10 siblings growing up in desperate poverty, and when he was about 13 he moved to London to find work. For the first few years he scraped by selling souvenirs from a stall along Oxford Street, a major commercial thoroughfare.
"When I was 14, 1 didn't know where I was going to sleep at night," he told The Irish Times in 2002. "It was absolute luck that I didn't get involved in a criminal life."
He found his calling after answering a want ad for an assistant at Michaeljohn, a relatively new salon whose regulars already included Mick Jagger and Liza Minnelli.
By the mid-1970s he was a full-fledged stylist. As he liked to tell the story, one day Elizabeth Taylor came by without an appointment, asking for another stylist, also named John. He wasn't there, but John Barrett was. She said he would do, and she was so happy with the results that she made him her regular hair dresser.
He moved to Los Angeles for several years in the 1980s, then back to London for a period before settling in New York in the early 1990s.
Mr. Barrett struggled with alcoholism in the 1980s and became sober in 1987, an experience he was quite open about. He organized charity salon events to raise money and awareness for sobriety, and he personally counseled dozens of people, including boldface celebrities, through their own alcoholism.
In New York he found a job with Frédéric Fekkai, another celebrity hairdresser. In a story he related to Fashion Week Daily in 2019, one day a woman came in and asked if he could comb out her hair for a party.
"You know," he said, "I don't think it's quite right. I need to cut it."
She said she didn't have time, but he insisted -- it would only take two minutes.
The next day she came back.
"I don't know what you did," she told him, "but it's what people are talking about."
The woman was Dawn Mello, the president of Bergdorf Goodman. The store was looking for a hairdresser to set up shop in its penthouse, a former residence of Andrew Goodman, one of its founders. Ms. Mello had offered it to Mr. Fekkai, but he had too many obligations. Mr. Barrett got the space instead.
Though his base skewed conventional and older, Mr. Barrett could also grab onto trends, or even start them. When ponytails and braids seemed about to have a moment, he opened a "ponytail bar" and a "braid bar," offering his own twists on the styles.
He traveled around the country to make house visits for some of his most high-end clients, and between 2014 and 2016 had a satellite salon in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Barrett is survived by five brothers, Gerry, Pat, Michael, Eddie and Joe, and a sister, Kathleen Dillane. Two brothers, Jimmy and Christopher, and a sister, Peggy Tierney, died before him.
After more than two decades with Bergdorf, he left in 2019 to open his own 6,400-square-foot salon nearby, on East 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. He filled it with books and art from his own collection, and with light fare from Bouchon Bakery.
The pandemic hit the salon industry especially hard, and Mr. Barrett was forced to declare bankruptcy. But he emerged quickly, without having laid off his employees.
And, despite health issues, he continued to cut hair for the many clients, rich and famous -- or just rich -- who came through his doors.
One day in April, Ms. Stewart, disappointed after her flight to Britain was canceled, decided to drop by his salon for a pick-me-up, an experience she later gushed about on social media.
"I used the newly found time to get a manicure pedicure by Luda and a haircut by the maestro himself @johnbarrettnyc," she wrote on Instagram. "The new do is refreshing and lovely! Thanks John!!!"

A Religious Ritual in Iran Becomes a New Form of Protest

The large crowd of men congregated at the center of a mosque in the central city of Yazd, Iran, clad in black and beating their chests rhythmically in unison. They were commemorating Ashura, Shiite Islam’s most sacred ritual, showcased annually with great fanfare in Iran as a testament to the Shiite theocracy’s power and strength.
But this year Ashura looked different. The mourners who gathered in Yazd last month and in many other cities across Iran diverged unexpectedly from the script to target the clerical rulers of Iran, turning religious ballads into protest songs about the suffering of Iranians.
“For a city in ruins, for all of us held hostage, for the grieving mothers, for the tears of the marginalized,” the men sang, according to videos. “We are mourning thousands of innocent lives, we are ashamed of this raging fire. Oh rain, oh storm, come. They have set fire to our tent.”
In Kermanshah, a Kurdish city in western Iran, a religious vocalist known as a maddah stood on the street, microphone in hand, singing about officials “stealing and devouring” resources away from desolate people.
And in Dezful, a small conservative city in the southwest, a similar vocalist delivered a scathing sermon against the government as the crowd marched in a ritual procession.
“Oh, my country, do you know why I’m grieving? Their only concern is hijab. They don’t see the blood, the poverty. They are stealing the public’s money,” serenaded the vocalist, Ibrahim Nassrollahi. “Fathers are ashamed, mothers are suffering. I wish they would see our poverty.”
Instead of the traditional chant that describes an ancient tale of grief, the crowd shouted back: “Iran, Iran, Iran!”
It was a surprising tone for the period of religious mourning known as Muharram, which lasts for a little over a month in Iran. This year it will end Sept. 6, with another big public ritual called Arbaeen that is expected to also become a platform for protest.
Ashura, which marks the 10th day of the mourning period, grieves for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who was beheaded in the year 680 in the battle of Karbala. Hussein led an uprising against the succession of Islam’s new caliph, Yazid, on the basis that his rule was corrupt and unjust, and in Karbala his small force was confronted by Yazid’s massive army and slaughtered.
For centuries Ashura has been more than just a religious ritual. From Iran to Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and beyond, it has served as a celebration of Shiite Muslim identity. Even some secular people participate in its stylized rituals, ranging from street processions, to theatrical reenactments and food handouts organized by neighborhood committees.
Social and political movements in the Muslim world have long been fueled and inspired by the narrative of Ashura, of the oppressed rising up against an oppressor. In Iran during the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy, a huge protest on Ashura became a turning point against the shah. During the country’s Green Movement in 2009, protesters, mostly young and upper middle class, took to the streets on Ashura to contest presidential election results.
Under Saddam Hussein’s rule, Iraqi Shiites were banned from publicly commemorating their mourning holidays. The Taliban government in Afghanistan recently announced a similar ban.
In previous years, maddahs in Iran occasionally delivered sermons with mild and indirect criticism of the government. This year, some of the ceremonies were the traditional grand spectacles and religious processions.
But the widespread and remarkable politicization of Ashura directly targeting the leaders of the Islamic Republic rattled the authorities, who warned that the protest tone was “making our enemies happy.” There were reports on social media of the brief detention of some of the leading vocalists and demands from the government that they tone down their rhetoric.
“The enemy had unpleasant dreams for Muharram this year,” Mohammad Mehdi Esmaili, Iran’s minister of Islamic guidance and culture, said last Monday. “They wanted to turn Muharram into the latest battlefield, but our people did not listen at all.”
But analysts said that instead of issuing fanciful denials, the government must reckon with the stark reality that opposition to it has now spread to some devoutly religious Iranians, who were once considered a loyal power base. The rebellion on display presents yet another challenge to the legitimacy of a theocracy that views itself as the global spiritual leader of Shiite Muslims.
Mohamad Ali Ahangaran, a conservative analyst of religion and the son of a prominent maddah who performs at government events, said in an interview from Tehran, Iran, that many Iranians were using every opportunity, including Ashura, to voice their opposition to the status quo.
“This year we saw the religious sermons and songs become more protest-driven than previous years, targeting the way the leaders are governing Iran, the widespread corruption in the Islamic Republic, the political obstacles we face,” said Ahangaran.
Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly encouraged Muharram ceremonies to be more political and take sides, but he never envisioned that in doing so it would one day turn “against the entire leadership” of Iran, including himself, said Ahangaran.
Nearly a year ago, Iranians took to the streets in nationwide protests demanding an end to the clerical government. The uprising was set off by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police, who had detained her on allegations of violating the mandatory hijab law. The government responded with violence, killing more than 500 people, including children, arresting tens of thousands and executing seven protesters.
“We saw the story of Ashura unfold in the streets with our own eyes as they slaughtered our youth last year,” said Maryam, a 55-year-old mother of two in Tehran who asked that her last name not be used, fearing retribution. “As a religious person, I want to completely separate myself from any ceremony connected to the regime.”
Maryam said her mother hosted a mourning ceremony at home this month for nearly 200 guests. She adorned the salon with black Ashura flags with Imam Hussein’s name and placed a picture of a killed protester next to each flag. “They are our new martyrs,” she said.
The 33-year-old son of a senior cleric in the religious city of Qom said that he was boycotting the Muharram ceremonies because of his opposition to the government and its violence. His relatives, he said, searched for ceremonies that either were not political or took on the regime. He also requested anonymity, fearing for his safety.
Some Iranians wore white, in defiance of the customary black attire, and trekked to cemeteries to pay homage to killed protesters. In the northern city of Amol, a religious marching band dressed in white went to the home of Ghazalleh Chelavi, a 33-year-old female athlete shot in the head during protests last September, videos showed. Her mother wailed by the door.
In Yazd, the maddah led the crowd in singing a famous poem that honors protesters killed by governments: “From the blood of our country’s youth, tulips grow.”
Then, comparing authorities in power to wheels, they continued, “Oh, wheel, how you have derailed, how you misbehave, how you take revenge. Oh, wheel, you have no religion and no principles.”
Amini’s mother posted a video on Instagram of her daughter’s grave illuminated by candlelight at night on Ashura. A woman’s voice could be heard singing the same poem.

Full text: A stable marriage (publicly at least) used to be a cornerstone of any world leader's résumé. Not in 2023.
Like many public statements on the disintegration of a high-profile split these days, this one appeared on Instagram. "After many meaningful and difficult conversations," a joint post said, Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, had separated from his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau. The couple, who have three children and have been married for 18 years, were once seen to have had a fairy tale romance. But while the story was soon dominating headlines, millions also gave a digital shrug.
Once upon a time, for most world leaders, major political capital lay in the careful crafting of at least the outward appearance of a stable marriage and persona as a family man or woman. According to Lori Gottlieb, a psychotherapist and a host of the "Dear Therapists" podcast, people wanted to feel that their leaders were a solid and steady presence, much as children want to feel safe with their parents, the leaders of their family.
"Because our first leaders were our parents or adult caregivers, we tend to equate stability with family stability," she said in an email, "which is why politicians tend to make their 'perfect' families part of the campaign, trotting them out in public. They're saying, 'I have created a solid, stable family, and I can do that for my country."'
Orna Guralnik, a psychologist and psychoanalyst, said that generally, social and political leaders have been supposed to hold onto the ego ideal, a Freudian concept for the idea of perfection that a person strives to emulate.
"Historically they have been imbued with everything that we want to idealize," Dr. Guralnik said in a telephone interview. "But in recent years, the ideological background of what we wish to project has changed rapidly."
Justin Trudeau is the first Canadian prime minister to go through a separation in office since that of his own parents. In one of the first instances globally, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his wife, Margaret, went through a divorce during his final months in office in 1984, having initially separated in 1977.
In the United States, Ronald Reagan may have been the first divorced president in history (none have divorced while in office), but it was Bill Clinton who really pressed the reset button and created a spectrum of acceptability on what a presidential marriage in 21st-century America could look like.
And elsewhere, world leaders including Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Vladimir Putin in Russia have divorced while in office.
Others have divorced and remarried while on the job, indicating perhaps that while divorce may have become more acceptable, marriage remains a cornerstone of political brand building.
Nicolas Sarkozy of France divorced his second wife in 2007, five months after the start of his term as president, then married the supermodel Carla Bruni four months later. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain finalized his divorce from Marina Wheeler in 2020. His marriage to his next wife, Carrie Symonds, in May 2021, made him the first prime minister of Britain to marry in office since Lord Liverpool in 1822.
The role of mayor of New York is not that of a world leader. But the way in which former Mayor (and 2020 presidential candidate) Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, announced their separation last month -- in a long and frank interview with The New York Times -- underscored the ways their problems can sound just like our own.
Who would want to be married to a politician anyway?
Several former world leaders -- and their spouses -- have been candid about the toll of such a role on their relationships. In May, a month after losing a tight election, Sanna Marin, the prime minister of Finland, announced that she and her husband, Markus Raikkonen, had filed for divorce. Jacinda Ardern, who stepped down as prime minister of New Zealand last year, said she did so because "the role had taken a lot out of me" and she "finally" wanted to marry her longtime partner, Clarke Gayford, after years of delays.
In a 2019 interview with The Daily Beast, Justin Trudeau's mother, Margaret, said her marriage to Pierre Trudeau broke down while he was in office because he worked 14 hours a day.
"We had one hour together every day," she said. "I was alone all the time. As first lady I was mostly either pregnant or nursing. My life was not as anyone imagined it was. We weren't in the same place."
Mr. de Blasio said, "I can look back now and say, 'Here were these inflection points where we should have been saying something to each other."'
"And I think one of the things I should have said more is: 'Are you happy? What will make you happy? What's missing in your life?"'
Just like us
As notions of family structures expand, and if political leaders' lives reflect our own, does that endear or alienate them from a population? Ms. Gottlieb suggested that political separations reinforce the idea that money or privilege can't buy happiness, much like the way people see separations of celebrities or royalty.
"Sometimes people might feel empathy for a couple, but what I see most is a feeling of relief for themselves," she said.
"They think: Wow, even world leaders who have everything -- power, money, fame, mansions paid for by our taxes -- struggle with parenting, arguing, sex lives, disconnection and personality differences just like many 'regular' people do."
Dr. Guralnik said that while people are more realistic about what they expect from modern marriage, a breakdown in expectations for public figures in their personal lives chimed, amid culture wars and a climate crisis, with a wider sense of being let down by those in power.
"The fact that leaders separate or divorce doesn't create shock waves as it once did because idealization around them has shattered," she said. "From the couch I hear so much about a loss of faith and even deep despair in modern governance and leadership. A marriage split leaves people resigned to thinking: There's just another human being that can't help us."

Full text: For two designers living in Brooklyn, meeting and marrying felt like destiny. The renovation of the grand apartment in France followed naturally.
By the time Megan Grehl finally met Côme Ménage, it felt as if their relationship was meant to be. Both had studied architecture and urban design internationally, and when Ms. Grehl landed in Shanghai in 2009 to work at the design firm Neri&Hu, she heard stories about Mr. Ménage, who had just left.
"We missed each other by a month," said Ms. Grehl, 37, who now runs her own interior design studio. "Our friends were like, 'Oh, it's too bad. You just missed Côme. He went to New York, and you guys would have gotten along so well."'
Ms. Grehl didn't think much of it at the time, but five years later, after she'd moved to New York, she and Mr. Ménage began following each other on Instagram. When she posted a photo of the Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, brownstone where she had rented an apartment, Mr. Ménage got in touch. It turned out they were next-door neighbors.
They became fast friends, and then a couple, marrying in 2017. Eventually, they moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they now live with their children, Yves, 5, and Ren, 1.
But when Ms. Grehl married Mr. Ménage, she got more than just a husband and a family -- she got a home in the heart of Paris.
Mr. Ménage, 39, who grew up in France, lived a peripatetic life for years. But when he moved to New York, he decided he wanted to maintain a foothold in Paris. "I took an apartment that I could go back and forth to, and that some of my family members could sometimes use," said Mr. Ménage, an architect who founded the firm Re-A.D, which works in the United States and France.
The apartment in the Ninth Arrondissement was a rental, "and it was a deal," he said, "because the whole building had to be renovated." Initially, he was paying about 3,500 euros (about $ 3,900) a month, but the rent has since increased to about 4,000 euros (about $ 4,500).
Before he met Ms. Grehl, Mr. Ménage made some basic changes. "It was your typical Paris Haussmann-style apartment, with a grand salon," he said, that had plenty of ornate 19th-century details, and a back corridor leading to a cramped kitchen and bathroom. To make those back spaces feel larger, Mr. Ménage knocked down one wall of the old kitchen and concealed a back stairwell to make space for a powder room and a larger bathroom.
"It was actually quite simple," he said. "But once Megan came into my life, I brought her here and she was inspired, and that spurred the idea to do more."
Ms. Grehl also met Mr. Ménage's mother, Odile Vilain, a massage therapist who sometimes invited clients to the apartment, and the pair hit it off. Before long, the family planned to give the apartment a significant decorative boost, mixing contemporary art and design, finds from Parisian flea markets and Asian-inspired elements, in a nod to Ms. Grehl's background (her mother is Taiwanese and she grew up in Asia).
In the living room, or grand salon, they maintained the original plaster details, but gave the room an eclectic look by furnishing it with modern pieces, including a vintage Artichoke pendant lamp by Poul Henningsen, a bulbous Culbuto chair by Marc Held and a graffiti-style painting by an artist friend who goes by the name Chanoir.
In the dining room, they took a more daring approach, painting the original paneled walls black and gold, and letting the gold fade toward the top, "to draw the eye up to the ceiling," Ms. Grehl said, "because it's so beautiful."
Inspired by the Japanese artist Hokusai, they ordered custom wallpaper featuring waves and figures from the artist's work; the graphic pattern now covers some kitchen walls. Then they installed Ikea cabinets, a wood countertop and backsplash, Gaggenau appliances and a painted tablecloth depicting fish that they repurposed as a wall-mounted artwork.
They gave their bedroom a fresh treatment with simple white drapery and a pendant lamp from Merci with a fabric shade, then transformed the second bedroom into a spa for Ms. Vilain, placing a console by Philippe Starck over a miniature garden of dried moss, grasses and flowers.
The result: an 1,800-square-foot apartment where each room evokes a particular feeling.
"It's good to have different concepts for different rooms," Mr. Ménage said. "As you find more pieces, you're not tied down, trying to be coherent across all of the spaces."
He added: "It allows for more experimentation and gives us more freedom" to shop the flea markets.
Mr. Ménage estimated that they spent about 120,000 euros (or $ 134,000) updating the apartment. They inquired about buying it, but the owner wasn't interested, so for the foreseeable future they will continue renting.
"The idea is to have it for a very long time," Mr. Ménage said. And because of that, investing in updates "just makes sense, for the comfort of everybody."

Full text: The author and host of "Extraordinary Birder" enjoys a meditative moment, complete with lute music, among the native plants in his rooftop garden.
Christian Cooper may be best known as the Black birder whose altercation with a white woman in Central Park in 2020 escalated into a national news story. But he's also a longtime gay activist and author who previously wrote and edited for Marvel Comics.
This year, he published a memoir, "Better Living Through Birding: Notes from a Black Man in the Natural World," in which a chapter is devoted to the Central Park incident. He also hosts "Extraordinary Birder," a National Geographic show that premiered in June on Disney+.
Mr. Cooper, 60, lives in the East Village with his partner, John Zaia, 53, a bartender.
WIRED I get up at 5:30 a.m. with no alarm. It's just when I pop awake. John sleeps later, so I get up and shut the bedroom door. I drink a glass of water. I don't drink coffee -- never have. As soon as I wake up, I'm basically wired.
HOMEGROWN I'm lucky enough that my apartment has its own roof garden. Unless it's raining, and sometimes even then, I drink my water and then go upstairs and sit in the garden. Nearly all the plants are native plants. There's a great birch, Virginia creeper, purple coneflowers. I can't leave out the grasses: There's switchgrass, which gets to four feet tall and is a natural barrier. It's native to New York. I'm part of what's called the Homegrown National Park system. Anybody can join. The idea is to get people to grow native plants in whatever space they have.
BREATHING IN THE GARDEN There is no better time to be up in the rooftop garden than Sunday morning, when the city is cleared out for a little while. I meditate. Not that long, maybe 15 minutes. If I'm lucky, there's a mourning dove cooing nearby. The mourning dove has a very rhythmic, soothing coo. Sometimes my eyes are open and sometimes they're closed. I'm emptying my head and breathing, opening myself up. Eventually I break out a speaker and play Renaissance lute music. I want the plants to hear it, too.
LIFT, THEN WOLF Then I'll go to the gym in my neighborhood. I spend an hour and a half to two hours on a free-weight workout. I like to keep myself in shape. I'm doing OK for an au naturel 60-year-old. Typically I'll eat six jumbo hard-boiled eggs before I go, for protein, but I only eat one or two of the yolks and ditch the rest. I'll also have a bowl of oatmeal. When I leave the gym, I'll go home and wolf down a baked sweet potato and a protein shake.
LOCAL LANDMARKS After that I might make a plan to meet some friends for brunch at Veselka. I've been going to Veselka 35 years or more. I like their cheese blintzes with raspberry sauce. Their pierogies are top notch. The other nice thing is it's Ukrainian, given the current war situation. I make a point of going through Tompkins Square Park on the way. There are a pair of red-tailed hawks that nest in the park, and this time of year it's the best show on earth: The young have fledged from the nest and they're full-sized hawks, but they're still learning and growing up. They're like awkward, gangly teenagers learning how to hunt right in front of your eyes.
COOL DOWN Later in the day is sort of free form. Since it's summer, I might take in a movie, especially if it's a hot day. I like to duck into an air-conditioned theater. I like sci-fi, fantasy and horror, but basically I'll see any movie. I love to lose myself in somebody else's reality for a couple of hours -- just go sit in the dark and eat popcorn.
TESTOSTERONE HIGH There's a strong possibility I'll go to the Eagle after that. It's a gay leather and Levi's bar, and on Sundays they have a rooftop they open up where they do a beer blast. I don't drink beer at all, but they serve liquor, too, so I'll have a cool, refreshing vodka tonic with lime. I go for the congregation of men. It's almost always exclusively men, so you can get a heady high on the testosterone. Everybody's up there schmoozing.
A SLICE AND A SIGHTING I'll go home for dinner. I'll cook something or maybe pick up takeout. I like Gruppo in my neighborhood for the thin-crust pizza. It goes down easy, so you don't feel bloated after eating three slices. John and I will probably eat the pizza -- the meat lover's, drenched in sausage -- in the rooftop garden. We'll also be looking for American kestrels. There's a pair of them that always nest in the vicinity. Sometimes they're perched on a high wire where we can get a good look at them. We're just chilling.
CHECKED OUT We try to watch a show on Sunday nights, but because I start to drift off at 9 p.m., there's mixed results on that. Now we're rewatching "Dark Shadows" from the 1960s. The camp value is off the charts. By about 10 or 10:30 p.m., the war to stay awake has been lost. But before I go to bed, I'll check out the website Joe.My.God. It's basically a news blog from a very progressive, gay perspective. I check it all day, every three or four hours, but I like to check it before I go to bed to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Full text: Health officials are investigating whether the Soft Serve on the Go brand, produced by Real Kosher Ice Cream, was behind an outbreak of listeria, a bacteria that can cause serious illness.
An ice cream company based in Brooklyn has issued a recall of all flavors of its soft serve ice cream and sorbet brand after two people who ate its vanilla chocolate flavor fell sick and were sent to the hospital, according to the company and health officials. The illnesses were possibly linked to listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause serious sickness in people 65 or older and miscarriages and premature births in pregnant women, health officials said.
The company, Real Kosher Ice Cream, said in a statement on Wednesday that it would immediately recall all six flavors of its Soft Serve on the Go Cups, packaged retail versions of soft serve ice cream and sorbet. Real Kosher notified all retailers that stock the brand, asking them to remove the products from shelves and freezers and dispose of them.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert on Thursday about a listeria outbreak that might be linked to Soft Serve on the Go Cups.
In its own statement updated Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration said that an investigation into the outbreak was "ongoing." The recall, the agency said, affects 19 states and the District of Columbia where the products are distributed, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Soft Serve on the Go Cups are also distributed in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Britain.
Ari Klein, one of the owners of Real Kosher Ice Cream, said the company was cooperating with health officials to look into the cause of the illnesses.
"We're dealing with them on a daily basis," Mr. Klein said, adding that the company had voluntarily recalled the entire line "even though it was only on one flavor."
"We are a family-owned business, not a multibillion-dollar corporation," Mr. Klein added. "And we felt this is the right thing to do."
Real Kosher said its other products, which include frozen pizzas and frozen fruit, were manufactured at a different facility and were not affected by the recall.
In a post on its official Instagram page on Thursday, the C.D.C. warned the public not to eat Soft Serve on the Go Cups, which it said had been served in at least one long-term care home.
The recall came after two customers, one in Pennsylvania and another in New York, were hospitalized between May and June after eating Soft Serve on the Go vanilla chocolate ice cream, health officials said. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture tested samples of ice cream from the freezer of one of the sick people and found traces of a strain of listeria.
Officials are still trying to determine whether that strain is the same strain of listeria that caused the current outbreak, the F.D.A. said. So far, no deaths have been reported.
Listeria outbreaks in the United States are not a new phenomenon. In June, health officials investigated a multistate outbreak tied to leafy greens. Previous listeria outbreaks have most likely been caused by contaminated deli meat and cheeses and other retail ice cream brands, according to the C.D.C.
Illness from listeria can occur within a few hours, or sometimes two to three days, after the consumption of contaminated food, health officials said. More severe symptoms, such as confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, can take three days to three months to develop.
Soft Serve on the Go products are sold in clear plastic eight-ounce cups and come in six flavors, including vanilla chocolate, caramel and peanut butter ice cream, as well as strawberry mango sorbet.
Mr. Klein said future versions of the products would be clearly marked with a label informing customers that they're safe to eat, once the company received guidance from health officials.
"They've been in our facilities many times, they've been in our offices, it's all guided," he said, referring to the officials.
In addition to Soft Serve on the Go, Real Kosher has seven other brands, including Klein's, its signature ice cream brand, and Chevra, a line of frozen pizzas, according to its website.

At Series End, Time for a Bow: [Correction]

Full text: After four seasons and the making of a superstar, the Disney+ series comes to an end. Its creator and showrunner unpacked the series and its finale.
This interview includes spoilers for the fourth season of "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series."
Tim Federle had never worked in television when he pitched Disney a somewhat bold new take on "High School Musical."
"I knew I couldn't promise a big flashy show, so I basically said: 'Mockumentary -- "Waiting for Guffman" style,"' said Federle, who created and oversaw "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series." "All the execs laughed in the room. They're like: 'It's crazy. It's too meta.' And I was like, 'Is it too meta that it just might work?"'
It worked. With the arrival on Wednesday of its eight final episodes, "HSMTMTS," as fans call it, wraps up a successful four-season run on Disney+. Federle seemed at peace with how it ended.
"Disney knows my dream was that the show would be the new 'Degrassi,' like 12 seasons, 100 spinoffs," he said. But he had written the Season 4 finale to end like a series finale, just in case.
"Unless you're 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,' you are really lucky to go beyond three seasons," he said. He was, he added, "reading the room."
When the original Disney Channel movie "High School Musical" premiered in 2006, it became an outsize pop-culture phenomenon, yielding a chart-topping soundtrack, a concert tour, a stage show, an ice show, two sequel films and a merchandise empire.
After the theatrical release of "High School Musical 3: Senior Year" in 2008, Disney looked at ways to reboot the franchise on the small screen. None materialized until Federle's "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series" premiered in 2019. The show took a tongue-in-cheek, self-referential approach, following a new group of theater kids who go to East High, worship all things "H.S.M." and frequently break into song.
When Federle pitched the series, he had performed on Broadway and written books, including the middle-grade novel "Better Nate Than Ever" and a cocktail recipe book. But his only Hollywood credit was co-writing the 2017 animated film "Ferdinand."
Now, he has an overall deal with Disney Branded Television, and the once relatively unknown cast members have become stars in their own right. Julia Lester is a Tony nominee for "Into the Woods"; Joshua Bassett embarked on a solo tour; and Olivia Rodrigo, who departed "HSMTMTS" after three seasons to focus on music, is a pop superstar and multiple Grammy winner.
"When we dropped Olivia singing 'The Start of Something New' in that first episode, I remember a number of comments on Instagram being like: 'She'll never hold a candle to Vanessa Hudgens's voice!"' Federle said. "Now, you see stuff that's like, 'I want Olivia Rodrigo back!' Nostalgia happens quickly."
The final season of "HSMTMTS" adds an extra layer to that nostalgia. As the East High students put on a production of "High School Musical 3," a film crew arrives to shoot "High School Musical 4: The Reunion" on campus. The original "H.S.M." cast members Corbin Bleu, Monique Coleman, Lucas Grabeel, Bart Johnson, KayCee Stroh and Alyson Reed all have cameos.
But the new class remains the heart of the series in its final episodes. Gina (Sofia Wylie) lands a life-changing movie role. Ashlyn (Lester) and Maddox (Saylor Bell Curda) confront their feelings. And Miss Jenn (Kate Reinders) must choose between performing in a national tour of "Wicked" and keeping the school theater program alive.
Speaking from his home office in Los Angeles, Federle, who also wrote and directed the two-part finale, looked back with gratitude on wrapping the series on his own terms. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Now that the show is over, do you feel you were able to accomplish everything the way you wanted?
The only bucket list item in the history of the show that didn't happen is Zac [Efron], Vanessa [Hudgens] and Ashley [Tisdale] being in the show.
I'm guessing you reached out to all three asking if they could do cameos?
Only every season. All of their reps were very gracious, but I could tell with schedules and other obligations, it was not going to happen. Ashley Tisdale personally called me and was like: "I want you to know two things: I love the show. And I'm literally launching a brand and I'm a new mom, and I can't get to Salt Lake." I was like: "I'm obsessed with you. The cast is obsessed with you. It's enough that you called me."
Did you consider having Olivia Rodrigo come back for the finale?
Of course. Something was going on at the time and the schedule was tough. She's such an important part of the show, and my goodness, how lucky am I? We got a generational songwriting talent playing a fork in "Beauty and the Beast" [in Season 2].
In the finale, Ricky (played by Joshua Bassett) finally asks the offscreen mockumentary crew, "Who the [expletive] are you guys?" So, who are they?
It ended up just being a camera style. A Disney+ executive had this idea in Season 1 of, "What if we got Zac Efron to turn a camera around at the end of the season and reveal he's been shooting this all along?" It's a great pitch, but I was like, "I don't think we want the vibe of like, Zac is now a documentary filmmaker who's following these students around as they have breakups."
Kenny Ortega has said it didn't feel possible to address Ryan's sexuality when he directed the original films. You confirmed the character (played by Lucas Grabeel) is gay in the Season 4 premiere. What were your discussions with Disney around making that official?
It was not asking for permission; it was more like: "Hey, you asked me to do a modern 'High School Musical.' I think this feels pretty modern." And I got no pushback whatsoever. You'd be surprised by how little pushback I got over the years on anything that might be considered slightly beyond the reach of quote-unquote regular family content.
Disney is sometimes criticized for having blink-and-you'll-miss-it queer representation , but you had multiple fully fleshed out queer relationships on this show.
I didn't know how to tell a story about theater people without telling a story about a lot of queer people. When I was in high school, I was surrounded by queer people in play practice and also, nobody was out of the closet. I came of age at the height of the AIDS epidemic. Like many men of my generation, I associated my burgeoning feelings with a potential death sentence. Which is a long way of saying, what really would have helped me feel less lonely in high school is to see happy, healthy, queer relationships onscreen without a lot of drama.
There's a scandal this season when we learn that Seb (Joe Serafini) cheated on Carlos (Frankie A. Rodriguez)! I was shocked.
Ultimately, I didn't want to create a queer fantasia where nothing bad ever happens. I did have a version of the last episode in my head that was going to jump 15 years into the future, and Seb and Carlos were going to get married. Then my co-E.P. Zach [Dodes] said to me: "The show is called 'High School Musical.' Maybe we leave it in high school."'
The finale left the door open for a potential spinoff. Have you had discussions about that happening?
Nothing official. These actors have an opportunity now to really stretch. I don't think they want to stay in high school forever, and as much as I would love "Ricky and Gina: The College Years" on Hulu, it may be time for them to sing some new songs.

Anxiety Grows Among Coastal Residents as Hurricane Season Predictions Worsen: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Officials on Thursday increased the number of storms they expect this season, another troubling sign for coastal communities that have been unnerved by extremely warm waters.
In places still scarred by the devastation of recent storms, the arrival of hurricane season stirs anxiety and apprehension that push many to search for any sign -- some based more on superstition than science -- that can provide even a wisp of clarity about what may be headed their way.
And this year, two of the more reliable (and meteorologically sound) indicators have been sending conflicting signals, injecting even more volatility into the process.
An El Niño pattern, like the one expected to ramp up this season, typically impedes the formation of Atlantic hurricanes. At the same time, extremely warm waters are unnerving experts and coastal residents, with heightened sea surface temperatures posing a range of threats, including the ability to supercharge storms.
"We know that's a recipe for hurricanes," said Roishetta Sibley Ozane, describing her own elevated sense of worry, as the prospect of more storms forces her to relive the back-to-back hurricanes that destroyed her home in Westlake, La., in 2020.
That unusual confluence of factors led forecasters on Thursday to raise the number of storms they expect this hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November, but it also led them to acknowledge that the circumstances were puzzling and made solid predictions even more difficult.
"Stuff just doesn't feel right," said Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University. "There's just a lot of kind of screwy things that we haven't seen before."
In a news conference on Thursday, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the Atlantic hurricane season could produce 14 to 21 named tropical cyclones, including the five storms that have already formed. That is a slight increase from the agency's original forecast in May of 12 to 17 tropical cyclones.
Forecasters now believe that six to 11 (previously five to nine) of those storms could become hurricanes, meaning they would reach winds of at least 74 miles per hour. Those could include two to five (previously one to four) major hurricanes -- Category 3 or higher -- with winds of at least 111 m.p.h.
El Niño, a climate pattern that recurs every few years, typically suppresses the formation of hurricanes in the Atlantic by creating a weather phenomenon called wind shear, in which wind speed and direction change with height in the atmosphere.
But for months, ocean temperatures have remained extraordinarily warm. They have climbed to nearly 100 degrees in some spots, destroying coral reefs, disrupting marine ecosystems and transforming Florida's beach waters into something akin to a hot tub. Scientists believe the underlying influence of this alarming warming is human-driven climate change.
And those warmer waters can also make tropical cyclones more resilient to wind shear, effectively blunting El Niño's ability to thwart storms, said Eric Blake, a scientist with the National Hurricane Center.
Experts have warned that warmer waters could also add to a storm's potency once it has formed. That means even a less active season could still be devastating. Some noted the 1992 season, which was milder than average but produced Hurricane Andrew, one of the costliest storms to hit the United States.
"You don't have to have a whole bunch of storms to have a real calamity," said Craig E. Colten, a geographer at Louisiana State University.
And the quiet now, Mr. Blake cautioned, was no indication of how the rest of the season would look. In August, there is often a jolt in tropical activity. "So things can get really busy in a hurry," he said.
The warm waters power what is known as rapid intensification, when a storm jumps up 35 miles per hour in less than a day. That can be the difference between a Category 2 and a Category 4 hurricane slamming into the coast.
Some of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the Gulf Coast in recent years underwent rapid intensification, including Michael in 2018, Laura in 2020 and Ian in 2022. Researchers have found that rapid intensification is happening more frequently and could be linked to climate change.
"Warm water is fuel for a storm," said Clay Tucker, a geography professor at the University of Southern Mississippi. "If you were to throw gasoline on a fire that's already burning, that fire would grow really rapidly, really quickly. It's the same idea."
Across the Gulf Coast, many remain haunted by the destruction of past storms and the turbulence they unleashed. In New Orleans, which was most recently struck by Hurricane Ida in 2021, emergency officials have warned residents about the emotional toll, including the "anniversary effect" of feeling on edge, restless and even physically ill this time of year.
"Being hurricane season prepared also means being compassionate and kind to yourself during times of hardship," NOLA Ready, the city's emergency preparedness campaign, advised in a post on Instagram.
In and around Lake Charles, the stretch of southwestern Louisiana that had been shredded by Hurricane Laura and then Hurricane Delta just six weeks later, those usual jitters felt magnified this year. The oppressive heat this summer has been a worrisome sign.
"People still have PTSD," said Ms. Ozane, whose experiences led her to create the Vessel Project of Louisiana, a mutual aid and disaster relief organization. "They're afraid. They see their communities are not fully recovered, and here we are in another hurricane season."
Families remain displaced or only recently settled. Obtaining federal support took a protracted effort. The housing and rental markets became a mess, making affordable housing scarce. And as a changing climate threatens to make hurricanes wetter, slower and more dangerous, worries have grown about the effects repeated hits could have.
"People are afraid Lake Charles will be wiped off the map," Ms. Ozane said, "and we came very close to that with Hurricane Laura."
After months crammed with her six children in hotel rooms, then months of piling into relatives' homes, Meoshia Sibley is now finally settled. It was low-income housing, and she wanted something better, she said. Still, she was terrified of losing it.
The renewed hurricane threat brings her back to losing her home the last time, the misery of evacuating, the disruption to her children's lives and the panic attacks incited by all of it.
Ms. Sibley, an administrative assistant and Ms. Ozane's sister, has tried to save money to help with riding out hurricanes only for other demands to interfere with that. "It never fails that something always comes up," she said.
"What am I going to do if a hurricane really comes?" she said. "How will I get to a safe place with these six children? It's very stressful."
During the busiest time of hurricane season, starting in August, she starts paying extra attention to the forecasts but also listens to the "word of mouth," as she puts it, from other veterans of hurricanes who might be better at divining what could be coming.
Now, she said, the vibe is "up and down, up and down." The heat has people nervous.
"I pray we don't have a bad one this year," Ms. Sibley said. "I pray it passes by. God has the final say so." As she saw it, she had just one option: "Wait it out, see what happens."

State of Pizza: This Year's Standout Slices: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Wait-worthy pies, a rooftop with apizza and plenty more excellent options in New York.
Pizza in New York is a lot like certain calculus problems (or that one scene in "Mean Girls"): The limit does not exist. We will never reach peak pizza, barring some pizza-related disaster. Which brings us to this year's State of Pizza, my second annual update on the latest pizza goings-on across this big, beautiful, pepperoni-peppered city.
A New New York Slice
Last year around this time, I was singing the praises of the clam pizza from Andrew Bellucci's Pizzeria in Astoria, Queens. So, I was heartbroken to learn of the sudden death of Mr. Bellucci, the restaurant's co-owner, in May. He had a complicated past, but one thing was never in doubt: He knew how to make pizza, and he knew how to make it exceptionally well.
He was also generous with that knowledge, and showed the ropes to Chris Hansell, the pizzaiolo behind Chrissy's Pizza. If you haven't heard of Chrissy's, prepare to hear about it nonstop once it opens to the public (hopefully) in late August. It started as a passion project in Mr. Hansell's apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and through word of mouth -- and a co-sign from the rapper Action Bronson -- it's become New York City's hardest-to-get pie.
That's not on purpose, by the way: The three-person operation is now based in the shoebox-size space in the East Village that Superiority Burger used to occupy and can produce only about 60 pies a day. I tried one of Chrissy's "test" pies just before pickup last week -- the shop is currently in "beta" and fulfilling long-sold-out preorders. I think I blacked out. This is the pie for anyone who loves an extra crispy, well-done crust, the kind that was perfected in neighborhood pizza parlors, many of which Mr. Hansell frequented with his father, whose picture sits in two places in the restaurant. The tomato sauce is made fresh, never sitting in a fridge for hours on end, with just a smattering of cheese. You won't get those legendary Ninja Turtle cheese pulls, but the pizza won't last long enough for you to care.
And a New New Haven Slice
If Chrissy's is repping the New York pie, then Lala's in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is the Connecticut delegate. This city isn't exactly head over heels for rival pizza styles, so it's particularly brave of Grimm Artisanal Ales to give over its entire rooftop to apizza (the New Haven term for its local style). I've been a fan of Grimm for a long time -- it was going hard on light-bodied sours during the New England I.P.A. arms race -- and the lovely little restaurant its owners have put together is perfect for a group hang or a first date. Go for the tomato pie, a cracker-thin pizza with shaved garlic, or the cozy pie with chunks of potato. And if beer isn't quite your thing, don't fret: Grimm now makes and serves its own wine.
You want New York pizza? All right, it's finally time for me to shout from the rooftops that one of the best and most underrated grandma pies in this city comes from Rocco Pizza, which advertises itself as "the last Italian family-owned pizza joint in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn." For years now, I've been inviting friends over for drinks and Rocco, and there's no greater pleasure than watching the surprise on their faces at just how good the crisp, buttery crust and cheesy interior are. I've held my silence long enough!
A Lightning Round of Impressive Pies and Super Slices
Scarr's Pizza moved to a new, larger location across the street on the Lower East Side, and it's serving slices until 11 p.m. or midnight. The new spot to be seen eating pizza with a Lambrusco spritz in hand is Manero's of Mulberry. The most inventive pizza in the city isn't being made in shops, it's being baked in portable ovens by nomads like Happy Bull Pizza, Traze and Wizard Hat Pizza. Have you been craving bulgolgi or kimchi on your pie? Try Appas Pizza in the East Village, or the new Bushwick location of Nowon. The chef Wylie Dufresne got into the pizza game with Stretch Pizza, but it's his appetizers that really shine, according to Pete Wells. If you're deadly serious about natural wine and margherita pizza, Decades Pizza in Ridgewood, Queens, is the answer. And as the food writer Mahira Rivers reminded us a few months ago on Eater, take good care of your pizza elders. They won't be around forever.

Deals Create Gray Zones In Hollywood: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The striking actors' union is granting waivers to some projects not affiliated with the major studios, but questions persist about who qualifies and why.
When you're making an independent film every second counts. Ash Avildsen had six days of filming left on his low-budget biopic "Queen of the Ring" -- including a climactic scene involving a majority of his cast -- when the actors' union went on strike on July 14.
The production, in Louisville, Ky., shut down immediately. If Mr. Avildsen could not receive an interim waiver from SAG-AFTRA, as the union is known, to continue filming, the project was likely to fall apart. The logistical and financial challenges of sending the cast and crew home and then trying to assemble them again after a strike would be too much for the shoestring production.
"It was maniacally stressful," said Mr. Avildsen, who wrote and directed the film, about Mildred Burke, who became a dominating figure in women's wrestling in the 1930s. "We could maybe have lasted another day waiting, but after two or three days it would have been a house of cards falling down."
"Queen of the Ring" was granted the waiver, one of more than 160 the union has handed out in the past three weeks. To get one, projects must have no affiliation with the studios the actors are striking against and the companies involved must comply with the most recent contract demands the union presented to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios.
Recipients of the waivers have ranged from under-the-radar projects like Mr. Avildsen's to higher-profile films like A24's "Mother Mary," starring Anne Hathaway, and Hammerstone's "Flight Risk," directed by Mel Gibson and featuring Mark Wahlberg.
For the union, granting the waivers serves three purposes: It allows companies not affiliated with the studio alliance to keep working; actors and other crew members to remain employed when so much of Hollywood has ground to a halt; and major studios to see examples of productions operating while acceding to the union's latest demands, including higher pay for the actors and increased contributions to the union's health and pension fund.
"Here are independent producers, who generally have less resources than the studios and streamers, who are saying, 'Yeah, we can make productions under these terms, and we want to and we're going to if you let us,"' Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's lead negotiator, said in an interview.
But the agreements are also causing confusion and consternation around Hollywood. Some wonder about the propriety of working on a production when so many in the industry -- the writers have been on strike since May -- are walking the picket lines. For instance, Viola Davis was granted an interim waiver for an upcoming film she was set to star in and produce. But she declined, saying in a statement, "I do not feel that it would be appropriate for this production to move forward during the strike."
The actress and comedian Sarah Silverman criticized the interim agreements in an Instagram post. She said that she had declined to work on an independent movie because of the strike, and suggested that she found the waivers counterproductive to the union's goals.
Ms. Silverman said she wasn't sure if she should be "mad at these movie stars making these indie movies that are obviously going to go to streaming" or upset with "SAG for making this interim deal for these indie movies" during the strike.
After meeting with the union's leadership, the actress said in a follow-up post that she was happy the waivers allowed some crews to continue working, but that she still questioned the validity of granting waivers to projects with big movie stars and loose affiliations with companies that are part of the studio alliance. The alliance declined to comment for this article.
One project that drew grumbles in some quarters when it received a waiver was the AppleTV+ show "Tehran." The show, filming its third season, employs union actors, but an Israeli company oversees the production, which is shooting in Greece. That situation has created a gray zone, Mr. Crabtree-Ireland said, even though Apple, a member of the alliance, is financing the operation.
Mr. Crabtree-Ireland called the approval of "Tehran" "outside the norm."
"We have to be mindful that not every country's law lines up with labor law from the United States," he said.
That has not helped clear up the matter for many in Hollywood. Even when the waivers are granted, there are some -- like Ms. Davis -- who wonder if accepting them is akin to crossing the picket line.
"What's confusing to us is what should we be doing?" asked Paul Scanlan, chief executive of Legion M, an independent production company that crowdsources funding for many of its projects, some of which await word on interim agreements. "The messaging isn't clear. There are some people saying, 'Oh, these interim agreements are bad,' but then SAG is saying: 'No, they're good. They're part of our strategy.'
He added: "We're sensitive to how we're perceived in the marketplace, and we don't want to be one of those companies that is perceived as doing an end run around the strike because that's absolutely not our intention."
Honoring the interim agreement does raise an independent production's costs. According to one independent financier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the strikes have the industry on edge, production budgets can increase by 8 to 10 percent, significant for independent films that already count every penny.
There is also the question of timing. Interim agreements can, as in the case of Mr. Avildsen, help a film finish production. But they can also be granted to completed projects to allow actors to promote their films, including at festivals, where they might end up securing a distribution deal with a company that the union is striking against and that has not yet agreed to a new contract. And that could get complicated.
"Let's say we sign an interim agreement," Mr. Scanlan said. "I do think it makes it harder for Netflix to buy something that has already agreed to terms that maybe they haven't agreed to yet."
For Mr. Avildsen, he's still basking in the relief that his movie was able to complete production. The idea that overcoming that hurdle may ultimately imperil "Queen of the Ring" from finding distribution is a scenario he's not yet ready to grapple with.
"It's a scary thing to think about," he said. "If by this time next year, when we are ready to release it, if they're still in their joust, that would be a big drag."

A Dynasty Returns. Artistic License Does, Too.: [Correction]

Full text: Season 1 of HBO's series about the 1980s Lakers came with drama, in more ways than one. Expect more for Season 2. An N.B.A. reporter takes a look.
Fictionalized shows drawn from real life don't always satisfy the people depicted. But when the subjects are superstars accustomed to speaking for themselves, their criticism can take on a life of its own.
That's what happened after the first season of HBO's "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty," which returns for a second season on Sunday. A dramatic series based on the journalist Jeff Pearlman's book "Showtime," its first season recounted the dawn of the legendary Los Angeles Lakers teams of the 1980s -- known as the Showtime Lakers -- under their swashbuckling and womanizing new owner, Jerry Buss (played by John C. Reilly).
Along the way, there was enough drama -- sex, drugs, infighting -- to fuel a prestige-era TV series.
But many of the people portrayed in Season 1 objected loudly to the way they and others were depicted -- Magic Johnson (Quincy Isaiah), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Solomon Hughes) and Coach Jerry West (Jason Clarke) among them. West even demanded an apology from HBO (and his character does seem more muted in the coming season).
What might they expect from Season 2? And what might we? As Max Borenstein, the series's co-creator and showrunner, insisted: "We're telling this story because we have great fondness and appreciation for these characters and the people and everything they've accomplished." But as he also put it: "We're not making a documentary."
Expect more drama, then, regardless of how faithful the depictions are. Here's a look at some of the history behind the coming season -- spoiler alert, for anyone who wants to watch without any prior knowledge -- and how the creative team approached the retelling.
What next?
Led by Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar, the Showtime Lakers, with their flashy, fast-paced and innovative style, won five championships in the 1980s and helped turn the N.B.A. into a multi-billion-dollar business.
By the end of Season 1, the dynasty was taking shape. The Lakers had just won the 1980 N.B.A. finals. Pat Riley (Adrien Brody) was still an assistant coach, and more of a hippie than a shark. Johnson grappled with his newfound fame, and an injured Abdul-Jabbar watched the championship victory from home.
Season 2 spans the years from 1980 to 1984, which got off to a rocky start. After winning the title in 1980, the Lakers were eliminated the next season in the first round of the playoffs. Season 2 addresses what comes after reaching the apex of one's ambition. When you win one, why is it so hard to do it again?
Said Borenstein: "You find people who achieve that have to look at themselves in the mirror and say: 'Wait. Is that all there is? What now? What next?"'
Starting in 1982, the Lakers went to the finals in eight of the next 10 years, an astoundingly successful stretch. Along the way, they had ups and downs. They beat the Philadelphia 76ers, led by Julius Erving, in 1982, then were swept by them in 1983.
Riley, who was promoted to head coach in 1981, transformed into the seemingly omnipotent force he is known as today. In 1984, the Lakers finally faced the Celtics and Larry Bird (Sean Patrick Small) in the finals.
Recreating Magic Johnson
For the sake of the narrative, the writers said they don't present everything exactly as it happened. Still, the basketball has to look credible. That's the job of Idan Ravin, the show's basketball producer, who helps shape every aspect of the show that involves basketball, from casting to choreography.
One problem: Not many people are built the way N.B.A. players are, and even fewer can accomplish their athletic feats. It's why Ravin, a longtime trainer for N.B.A. stars, chuckled when HBO first called a few years ago to ask for his help to "convert an actor into Magic Johnson."
"There's 400 guys in the N.B.A. that can't be Magic Johnson," Ravin said he remembered thinking.
At 6-foot-3, Isaiah is six inches shorter than Johnson, and he was stocky from his days as a football player. Ravin helped him slim down so his silhouette approximated Johnson's.
To get him to move like Johnson, Ravin put Isaiah through the types of workouts he had used for players like Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant. He taught Isaiah how to sell Johnson's famously artistic passing -- the way he turned his head for no-look passes, the subtle movements that made his bounce passes so precise.
Johnson publicly asked for a trade in 1981, a year after agreeing to a 25-year deal worth $ 25 million that some found absurd. Coach Paul Westhead was fired the next day, a move Buss said was unrelated.
One challenge, said Rodney Barnes, one of the show's executive producers and writers, was presenting that drama and how Johnson interacted with his teammates in ways that still allowed the audience to root for Johnson.
"You have to be able to address an ego that it takes to become great at anything," Barnes said.
Riley's transformation
Season 2 shows Riley becoming head coach after his spiraling friend Westhead (Jason Segel) was fired -- a transition Borenstein described as "Shakespearean" -- and then learning how to command respect.
"We kind of looked at it as having a superhero donning his cape and cowl, but what's behind that?" Borenstein said. (Riley dons an Armani suit and about a gallon of hair gel instead.)
Riley, now the president of the Miami Heat, has won nine championships as a player, coach or executive, and been to the finals 19 times.
He is revered by N.B.A. players and considered one of the best basketball executives in history.
An unlikely endorsement?
Jerry Buss's daughter Jeanie, the current controlling owner of the Lakers, gave mixed reviews of Season 1. She has said it doesn't reflect her life (her '80s self is played by Hadley Robinson), but she also complimented a clip from the first season on her Instagram page.
Borenstein said he'd had a "very lovely and very positive" interaction with Jeanie Buss about the show; it was "gratifying," he said, to "feel that she feels that we've done right by her dad and by her story."
One clue that Buss may be a fan: Her fiancé, Jay Mohr, has a cameo in Episode 6 of Season 2.
Still the producers seem more prepared for any backlash to Season 2. They included a companion guide with the advance episodes for journalists, in which they cite their sources: the excerpt from Johnson's book that details an awkward brunch depicted in Episode 3; the footage of an insane news conference that comes in Episode 5.
"We didn't just make it up," Barnes said, adding later: "It's really hard to tell the other side of real life characters that people love."

Full text: I was a popular dancer in high school and I saw rap from the B-boy stance when rap was being plugged up into the streetlights. When I was going to school, the Cold Crush Brothers were going to school with me. It wasn't until the mid-80s that I started rapping, which turned into Ultramagnetic MCs.
I met Ced Gee when we were going to high school together and we formed the group. We listened to the Treacherous Three, who would use a lot of big words in their raps. They were using words nobody was using. We looked at the Treacherous Three like: This is the point of hip-hop. I want to rhyme like this. I don't want to do the "Yes, yes y'all, ya don't stop the body rock!" They put pen to paper. Now rap was about vocabulary. It was no longer baby rhymes.
T La Rock was one of the most high-tech rappers at that time with the technical words. I was hanging with Greg Nice. We had a chance to see everybody from the super old-school acts all the way up to Spoonie Gee, Run-DMC and Whodini. They were all out with records before we even had a deal.
At the time there was a craze happening where everyone was using TV-show themes. So we waited for that craze to go by and that's when rap started going heavy with the samples. It became MC Shan, Eric B. & Rakim and then Ultra. So when "Ego Trippin"' came out, that was like the third record that shocked everybody like, Wow, this is different!
We pressed up 500 copies of "Ego Trippin'." We hit Red Alert off, and I delivered the records straight to Marley Marl's house. I remember Big Daddy Kane was in the kitchen. That's where Marley had his mic set up.
Marley was really open to it. He spun it on WBLS. And then I gave Chuck Chillout a copy in person. I remember me and Funkmaster Flex used to talk in his car about different rappers.
To be honest, a lot of rappers were jealous of Ultramagnetic MCs, but when "Ego Trippin"' came out, there was nothing you could do because every car had it playing up and down the block. You would hear it in every project. All you would hear is "MC's Ultra! MC's Ultra!" everywhere you went. I would go through the projects and people would scream and we didn't even have a video out. I wasn't popular on TV. I don't know how people had a vision of knowing a person without even seeing them on social media, on Instagram. Back then it was more about the fliers and posters and people seeing you on a show with Boogie Down Productions.
If you listen to the second verse of "Ego Trippin'," I was just making the words fit on a beat. I wasn't trying to rhyme: "Through the scientific matter I probe for evidence/Leading melodies obtaining slight positive beams/Of the average formulation, apply mechanically." And people didn't even know what I was doing because the first verse of the record was more straight rap. The beat was so hot and the chorus was so dramatic that you didn't even realize the second verse didn't rhyme.
At that time, I liked Lakim Shabazz. I liked Latee's "This Cut's Got Flavor" and stuff like that. But once we were out, I tried not to follow rap in a lyrical way because I thought that if I listened to everybody's rhymes a lot, I wouldn't have my own originality. I used to buy funk records like Con Funk Shun because I was a dancer. I bought Undisputed Truth and Cameo. My main inspiration was Slave. That's why Ultra's music was like that. I didn't grow up on jazz. I didn't know about Ron Carter or Ronnie Laws.
When I started the Dr. Octagon project, I had so much material piled up that I had to break it up into different characters. People thought I was just being weird, but I was being a businessman.
A lot of artists were stuck as just one person. They had to do a record deal with that same style again. But I had a lot of ideas. I think that's why Parliament-Funkadelic opened my mind up. They had Brides of Funkenstein, they had Sir Nose, Funkadelic and Parliament. George Clinton broke his group up into so many different parts. So that's what I felt like: a one-person Parliament-Funkadelic.
During that time, I tended to like the peculiar people. I liked the artists that had flows, like Fiend and Mac from No Limit. But a lot of the rappers couldn't adapt to different sounds. That made me feel like, OK, I'm going to create a Dr. Octagon. I'm going to create a Dr. Dooom. I'm going to create a Black Elvis. But all of those characters are part of me.

Full text: When collectors die, their families face a lot of decisions, including what to do with a hundred Superman figurines.
"More times than I can remember, a spouse or child has said to me, 'If he wasn't dead, I'd kill him all over again for leaving me with this mess,"' said Greg Rohan, the president of Heritage Auctions.
Most people tend to know what to do with traditional investments after someone dies, he said, but when it comes to baseball cards, first-edition books, coins and other collectibles, the loved ones dealing with the estate can be stumped (and annoyed).
If some collectors of, say, vinyl figurines, seem to have a gene that spurs them to dedicate entire rooms of their home to inanimate rubbery friends, they are also, in many ways, just like everyone else. "People don't want to think about dying," said Maggie Thompson, 80, a former senior editor of Comic Buyer's Guide, which was a newsmagazine that covered the comic book industry. "I realize as I look around my rooms, my family is not going to know what things are."
Ms. Thompson, whose eclectic collection includes Polaroid photos, film posters and comic book art, knows firsthand that not having a plan can mean a lot of responsibility for survivors. Her brother, Paul Edgar Curtis, died last year, and her family spent months dealing with his comic books and other mementos.
The market for many collectibles has been heated of late. In April, a rare Pokémon card sold for $ 300,000 at Heritage Auctions. Last year, the original art for a comic book page featuring Spider-Man in his black costume sold for $ 3.36 million at Heritage, and a copy of Superman No. 1 went for $ 5.3 million in a private sale. In 2021, a Nintendo Mario 64 game in its original packaging sold for $ 1.5 million.
Those rarities -- and their enriched owners -- aside, collectors can have a disconnect from their families. "I'm not going home and talking to my partner or to my kids about what I collect because nine times out of 10, they don't care," said Josh Benesh, 38, the chief strategy officer and general counsel for Heritage Auctions. (His own collectibles include television and film props, American regional art and modernist jewelry.)
Many collectors keep a mental log of their wares, but they would be wise to keep a physical list and address their collections in their wills. "It's not really about doing it for the sake of money, but it's making sure that the responsible stewardship of your collection extends beyond your life," Mr. Benesh said.
Karl Heitmueller Jr., 58, runs The Daily Superman on Instagram, where he highlights his Man of Steel memorabilia. He has grappled often with the fate of his collection. "All the people to whom I plan on passing on my collections are close to my age," he said. "So it's a crapshoot. Who is going to kick first?"
Mr. Heitmueller said that his brother, who has collected more than 10,000 vinyl records, would be the primary beneficiary, with other items earmarked for friends. "It's one of those things I need to work on," he said. "If he were to die first, I wouldn't know which of his things were worth a lot of money and vice versa."
Still, Mr. Heitmueller has a vision of what he'd like to see after his demise. "I don't want a funeral," he said. "I don't want a memorial service. I don't want money wasted on any of that stuff."
Instead, he would like his family and friends to browse his collection and take what they want. "If I were to die tomorrow, I would like to think that all of them would not mind having a Superman action figure of mine to keep to remember me by," he said.
Richard Pini and Wendy Pini, whose comic book fantasy series ElfQuest debuted in 1978, wrestled with what to do with her body of work for most of their professional lives.
Over the years, they had amassed thousands of pages, including all the original art for the series, which was edited by Mr. Pini, 73, and drawn and written by Ms. Pini, 72. "He would never envision selling off the work individually," Ms. Pini said.
Mr. Pini said it would have been heartbreaking to sell it piecemeal. "I saw lines being put down." he said. "I heard the curses when she needed to reach for the whiteout. It was all very personal."
Selling the artwork could have been lucrative. "There are art dealers who come up to Richard at conventions," Ms. Pini said. "They've never even met him before, and the first thing they say is, 'You idiot. You could have made millions off of selling the artwork."'
Mr. Pini said that they knew they wouldn't be leaving their collections to their families, who weren't particularly interested in ElfQuest in the first place. The fear, then, was that the material would end up at a garage sale.
Their knight in shining armor came in the form of Karen L. Green, the curator for comics and cartoons at Columbia University, which acquired the Pinis' work in 2013. "We treasured the idea of students and fans studying it in the future after we're long gone," Ms. Pini said.
But many collections are destined for less hallowed institutions. When the end comes, families sometimes go to the most convenient source -- a local comic book store, a pawnshop -- and may only get a fraction of what their collections are worth. In other cases, a collection is worth much less than what the owner, or inheritor, thought.
Vincent Zurzolo, an owner of Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect, recalled a story from early in his career. A man thought he had a hugely valuable set of stamps, he said, and "my employer went down to look at the collection and it turned out all he did was cut out pictures of stamps and put them into a book."
Still, it's hard to predict the value of collectibles, given that not long ago a first-generation iPhone fetched $ 63,356.40. Collectors -- and their families -- would be wise to remember the marketplace can be fickle. "Collectibles do go down in value," Mr. Benesh said. "We don't like to talk about that, but there are Beanie Babies in this world."

I Chose to Put On Lipstick for All This?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Lunch with an older friend prompts a writer to try some seemingly outdated stratagems for attracting a mate.
I don't usually wear lipstick. Or heels. Or pants with zippers.
Post-pandemic, post-babies and post-divorce, I've grown selective about how I spend my energy and time, and cobbling together a costume of femininity takes a significant amount of both. But I wonder if this laissez-faire perspective (ahem: sweatpants in public) has kept me in relationship purgatory, where I'm never actively dating but still secretly hoping someone special will intuit the beauty beyond my sweats.
On a recent lunch date with a friend in her 80s, I listened with mounting dread as she lamented her own divorce, which happened 30 years ago. With tears in her eyes, she said there'd been no one serious in her life since her marriage ended, and she was resigned to dying alone.
All at once I was looking across the table at my future self. There I was, four decades later, mourning the second-act relationship that had never happened. There I was, ordering Diet Coke refills in a suburban Carrabba's, convinced my marriage had been my one shot at love and that I had wasted it on the wrong person. There I was, telling a friend half my age that sometimes, no matter how much you want it, love may never show up.
I left the restaurant shaken. My life was half over, and I was on the express train to Lonelyville: a singles room in the nursing home. Ravioli leftovers for one. The distant, dreamlike memory of what it felt like to be touched. I had to change course, but it wasn't as simple as just "getting back out there."
The end of my marriage hadn't been an anomaly -- I had never had a healthy, long-term relationship, and I couldn't understand why. Did I have unrealistic expectations? A fear of intimacy? A broken partner picker? All I knew for sure was that the common denominator in every failed relationship was me.
That night, while swiping past the Instagram posts of partnered family and friends, a sponsored video stopped me mid-scroll. A hunky New Zealander had a question for me. Yes, me. Did I know how to inspire emotional attachment in the man of my choice? (I did not.) He went on to say that creating emotional attachment was the only way to form a lasting relationship. While I had thought of love as something that happened to me, like a natural disaster, this guy was saying that lasting relationships were intentional bonds cultivated by people with a very particular set of skills, none of which I seemed to possess.
I signed up for a relationship boot camp. The first assignment was to read a 102-page PDF that revealed how to "capture his attention and win his heart" using proven principles of attraction. Perfect, I thought. I'll finally know what to say on a first date, how to sniff out psychopaths before I sleep with them, and how to shepherd that initial spark of attraction into something deeper.
But when I opened the PDF, I found it packed ... with lipstick.
Chanel Rouge Coco Bloom. MAC Ruby Woo. Wet 'n' Wild Shining Hibiscus.
"Principle #1: Have Luscious Lips!"
When a woman is aroused, her blood flow increases, making her lips appear redder and fuller -- AKA nature's lipstick! Studies show that men prefer women who wear lipstick over women who don't!
I stared at the words, my un-luscious lips agape, wondering if this "boot camp" was nothing more than a collection of Cosmopolitan-style beauty hacks written by ChatGPT.
"Principle #2: Have Wide Hips!"
Over millennia, men learned that coupling with wide-hipped women led to more successful procreative outcomes!
Fine, I thought. Wear makeup, rock a hot bod and swallow every media-inspired standard of beauty. But should I mention my kids on a first date?
"Principle #3: Stick Out Your Sexy Bum!"
It went on like this for 102 pages. I laugh-cried my way through the list, texting pictures of the "principles" to friends and mentally calculating my boot camp refund.
But in the days that followed, I became slightly obsessed with the principles, particularly their "scientific" explanations. Let me be clear: the principles were absurd. They were comically archaic and offensively exclusive to "feminine women seeking masculine men." But I was spellbound by the idea that attraction could be sparked by something as simple as smudging some color on my mouth.
What if our cultural standards of attractiveness really could be traced back along evolutionary lines to their original source, like a rumor that's mostly false but partly true? Maybe what had been missing in my quest to attract the right partner was biological. Maybe, without lipstick, I was invisible to men! It would be impossible to inspire emotional attachment in someone who hadn't even noticed me, right?
I started wearing lipstick on Zoom calls for work. Bright lipstick. Arousal lipstick. I strutted across the grocery store parking lot to create the illusion of wider hips. At my son's baseball practices, I stuck out my "sexy bum" just to see what it felt like. (It felt stupid.)
I did nothing else out of the ordinary -- no makeover, no personality transplant -- but men I'd known for years started responding to me differently. For the first time since our sons started playing together, the Baseball Dads seemed aware of my existence.
Cute Dad struck up conversations during practice. Tall Dad noticed me squinting in the bleachers and positioned himself to block the sun from my view. Canadian Dad gave me a high-five and traced his fingers across my palm before letting go.
As preposterous as I initially thought the principles were, they seemed to work. For a few weeks, I felt positively witchy every time some poor sucker let me skip him in line at the self-checkout, and I waited for the attention to manifest a date. Several months later, I'm still waiting.
These days I've been getting notifications to order more lipstick, because I'm supposed to be running low, but I haven't worn lipstick in weeks. It seemed to me that the attention I got when I followed the principles wasn't leading me to a future I really wanted. Instead, it pointed to an ancient past, prompting a biological reflex that, while initially flattering, felt like a cheap substitute for a real connection. Why put on lipstick just to be reminded that what's missing in those moments of attraction is what's most essential?
According to the boot camp syllabus, I'm supposed to be bantering with men on dating apps, using compliments that double as insults because "men want to play."
You know what I want? A handsome stranger who approaches me from across a crowded room. "I couldn't help but notice your lipstick," he might say, handing me a moist toilette to wipe it off. He'll look me up and down, frowning at the too-tight jeans I can barely zip up. "Let's get out of here," he'll say. "You look like you want to slip into something more comfortable."

Full text: The late '80s and '90s was like the Marvel Universe but for rappers -- same universe, different heroes. We were witnessing the evolution, the growth of this thing we have.
What I felt was always great was the Native Tongues, from De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest to Queen Latifah to Black Sheep. It was always dope to have people -- especially during that time period when it was pretty rough -- have that amount of confidence to be different. It solidified how dope they were, because most people were just emulating what was hot. I think De La and Tribe was good especially for young fellas on the block who didn't want to be a drug dealer, you know what I'm saying? To know I could be cool and not be into violence. I thought that that was an important element to add into what was going on.
In our lane, we were looking at Mobb Deep, M.O.P., Wu-Tang. Nas kind of ushered in our age class. He was a child of the grandmasters, I would say. He was definitely a product of Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS-One and Rakim, but mixed with what was going on with the youth outside at that time. We're getting cars and chains and nice gear and all of that off of the streets, but we into our rhymes.
The Golden Era babies is what I like to call us. I don't think before that nor after that was ever as competitive as that time period.
Kool G and Kane are on "The Symphony," but there is no Kane and KRS song, no Kane and Rakim song. In the '90s, though, you was hopping on verses with each other, people from different boroughs, different places. You couldn't be trash during that era. I would never disrespect those who came before me, but there was people out when Rakim, Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS, EPMD, Jungle Brothers was out that was absolute trash and still getting recognition, getting honored, getting love. During Mobb Deep, us, Nas, Hov, Big, Rae, Ghost, you couldn't say a trash verse or you was trash. Our whole career was that competition. I definitely believe people got scared to put us on their records.
But let's even take albums out the mix. With mixtapes, you wanted to be in that No. 1 slot. So if you know anything about the Lox in the mixtape era, we was always the No. 1 slot. I remember going to DJ Clue sessions and seeing different artists there and going, oh, we're gonna absolutely make the illest record. This gotta be No. 1 when the tape come on. I remember doing the Stretch Armstrong freestyle going, oh no, we gotta burn this. This is Stretch. This is getting heard.
And then after that period, everybody's all super friendly. Internet fame and Instagram and Twitter and all of this to where it's a lot of fluff. Celebrities like being with other celebrities, but they wasn't trying to burn nobody on the mic. I can't say the whole era is guilty -- Cole is gonna try to burn you, Kendrick's gonna try to burn you. But that don't stand for the whole. They just rather stand with each other, take a picture and be dope, get in the studio, make a catchy song but not really try to burn each other. So I feel fortunate we came from the most competitive time period in hip-hop that may ever exist.
I'm from the Lox. When you're in a group, that natural sense of competitiveness comes out. You want the best for the group, but nobody ever wants to be second fiddle. You don't wanna get ate. Never. I never make a verse and go, I want to have the least favorite verse. Never. I always want the best verse. If it doesn't happen, I'm cool and I'm comfortable and it is what it is. It's like ballplayers getting on the court. Yeah, you on your team and you want the team to win, but who goes, "I want him to win M.V.P."? Nobody.

Audio Stories Are Redefining Female Pleasure: [Style Desk]

Full text: Apps like Dipsea and Quinn have become popular destinations, particularly for some women who find them safe spaces to explore their sexuality.
"You know, I'm a sucker for a California queen bed," Liz says to her girlfriend, Sevyn.
"I'm imagining us chillin' on that balcony," Sevyn says.
Liz laughs and responds, "Well, there's some other things I'm imagining too ..."
Liz and Sevyn are characters in "Open Floor Plan," a series on the audio erotica app Dipsea. Like mini podcasts but spicier, these stories detailing sexy scenarios fill the space between audio romance novels and visual pornography.
Since Dipsea began publishing at the end of 2018, a handful of similar apps have hit the market. While Dipsea's stories are narrated by voice actors and written in house, Quinn, another popular platform that launched in 2019, hires mostly content creators to produce the app's stories. Other platforms like OhCleo and Bloom use a combination of those formats.
"There's clearly this gap between what erotic content has traditionally meant and what women are looking for," said Caroline Spiegel (sister of Snap's chief executive, Evan), the founder of Quinn. "Now, there's a growing opportunity to give women products and services that fill their sexual needs, because they have their own money to spend."
Designed in sleek modern packages, these apps can easily be confused with those used for meditation, yoga or therapy -- an intentional marketing plan. Situating pleasure in a wellness wrapper has allowed them to exist on Apple's app store and Spotify, as well as advertise on Facebook and Instagram.
On average, subscribers for Dipsea are women between 18 and 34, the company said, while Quinn's are women aged 18 to 24. Dipsea said its revenue grew 40 percent last year, though it declined to provide specific figures. Quinn said the average listenership for the past three months had been 14 million minutes each month. ("For context, in all of 2021, we saw 3.2 million minutes listened," Ms. Spiegel said.)
Hannah Albertshauser and her husband, Michael, are the co-founders of Bloom, an erotic audio platform based in Germany. According to a survey they recently conducted, Bloom found that there were just as many users who enjoy romantic content as were interested in stories involving different kinks, partner sharing and bondage. Despite Mr. and Mrs. Albertshauser starting Bloom to create more guided sex options for couples, 40 percent of its listeners are single women and over half are between 18 and 34, according to the same survey.
Experts say that the biggest benefits of audio erotica are its ability for listeners to imagine and be in control of their own story.
"I tell clients and students, if you're constantly watching something, you're never getting to create your own fantasies, explore your erotic imagination and know what your boundaries are," said Mal Harrison, the executive director of the Center for Erotic Intelligence, a collective of researchers and educators who study human connection and sexuality. Audio erotica, she said, is a response to power imbalances and sexual domination often seen in visual pornography.
Before these apps existed, Reddit threads and the back alleys of Tumblr were often used to create erotic audio content particularly made by and for women.
"It felt like when you wanted accessibility to pleasure, it was in a brown paper bag down a dark alley," said Dominnique Karetsos, the chief executive and co-founder of Healthy Pleasure Group, which invests in sexual health and technology companies, including Dipsea. When she started investing in the space nearly 10 years ago, the market was limited, she added.
But by the early 2010s, Ms. Karetsos said, products made for women's pleasure were marketed through partnerships with retailers like Selfridges and Sephora. The accessibility to and demand for these items created "social permission," she said, for women to talk about pleasure openly.
Last year The New York Times reported that Facebook rejected numerous women's sexual health advertisements. In 2019, the sex toy company Dame sued the M.T.A. for banning its advertisements while those for erectile dysfunction medication remained.
Gina Gutierrez, who founded Dipsea with Faye Keegan, said that much of what set audio erotica apart was that it was marketed as sexual wellness, unlike conventional porn. "Female pleasure is seen as especially gratuitous and frivolous," she said. "We wanted people to feel like they were making a choice that was good for them."
'It's actually like a wellness practice'
Liv Trexler downloaded Dipsea in 2021 after seeing its advertisement on social media. "It was weird at first," she said. "But when I actually tried it, things went well, very well."
She now uses Dipsea regularly and said the $ 12.99 monthly subscriber fee was worth the cost. "It's not harmful to those who make it, and it's not a harmful thing to those who hear it," said Ms. Trexler, a 29-year-old project manager who lives in Brooklyn. "It's actually like a wellness practice."
Angela Sarakan, a senior audio producer at Dipsea, said that the dialogue featured in its podcasts could provide listeners the tools to set healthy boundaries. "You're listening in on the private worlds of these characters and, in that way, learning more about yourself and the way you might want to communicate or do things differently."
Audio erotica's emphasis on communication and boundary-setting has helped some users with anxiety around visual porn.
"It was very hard for me to extricate any idea of sex, especially casual sex, from feeling safe," said a 25-year-old woman who was a victim of sexual assault. The woman, who requested not to be identified by her full name, said audio erotica helped her reconnect with her body through imagination. "It helped me get out of my head a little bit in terms of self-consciousness, like comparing my movements and my body to people on the screen," she said. "It made me see how you could have your sex life as part of a creative, imaginary life that feels meaningful."
Olivia Taylor, the editorial lead of Dipsea, said the app's goal was to capture the "texture of life and the texture of sex." Dirty talk, moans and the ruffling of sheets are just some of the sounds you may hear on the app. Dipsea's characters are often written with enough specificity for listeners to relate to, but vague enough for them to imagine themselves inside the story.
"It might make you be like, 'Hey, wait, that's not me, this is some other person or some other body that doesn't feel like mine at all,"' Ms. Taylor said. The editorial team, she added, keeps this in mind as they edit.
Aisha Jordan, an actress and a spoken word artist, was among the first to audition as a voice actress for Dipsea in early 2019. She landed the role of Liz and has since narrated many other stories. "Sometimes you're breathing into a microphone for 20 seconds," she said. "Sometimes you have to do something like kiss your hand to get a more authentic sound."
Ms. Jordan receives a full character description and a story arc with each script. "It's not just a sexual moment. It's an experience," she said. "Especially for a woman of color to be able to do this, it's super exciting. It allows you to be seen as a full person and not just stereotypes."
Although sexual wellness is a growing industry, research on the subject is still met with skepticism.
"It's just highly stigmatized, more so than drugs," said Dr. Nicole Prause, a neuroscientist who studies how pleasure can be used as a treatment for chronic pain, anxiety, sleep disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. "I almost lost my graduate funding." She said she no longer uses the word "sexual" in research proposals.
Dr. Prause hopes audio erotica will help raise awareness of the positive, if not therapeutic, outcomes of sexual wellness, though she recognizes its limitations.
Ms. Taylor of Dipsea believes that the format can at least offer an alternative. "We're showing much more than a snapshot of sex," she said. "It's the whole story of how people connect."

For Striking Actors, Cameo Makes a Comeback: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Others are using the service, through which fans can pay for personalized videos, to engage with followers while not publicly promoting work.
On July 24 Cheyenne Jackson, an actor, posted a photo on Instagram that showed him shirtless, with glistening abs, veiny arms and his lips parted.
"This is me subtly letting you know I'm back on @cameo," its caption read.
Cameo is a service through which celebrities and others can be paid to make personalized videos commemorating birthdays, bachelorette parties, divorces and the like. Mr. Jackson, who has appeared in the "American Horror Story" TV shows and in "30 Rock," said in a phone interview that he reactivated his account because of the continuing strike by SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union.
Mr. Jackson, 48, charges $ 95 for a video message and cited bills -- "I have two kids" -- as one reason he is on Cameo. "There are only so much sources of income," he said.
"My husband cringed a little," he added. "But you've got to do what you've got to do."
Since Cameo debuted in 2016, some actors have used it when traditional work has dried up. In 2021, as the pandemic raged, the actor Andrew Rannells joined Cameo to raise money for the Entertainment Community Fund, a nonprofit formerly known as the Actors Fund. On a recent episode of "And Just Like That...," the "Sex and the City" reboot, the character Che Diaz, played by Sara Ramirez, starts making Cameo videos after a TV pilot is canceled.
According to data provided by Cameo, there was a 137 percent increase in the number of accounts reactivated or created on Cameo in July compared to June (the strike started on July 14). The number of orders for videos remained about the same for each month, but Cameo said orders usually drop in July because there aren't events like graduations and holidays like Father's Day.
Some of the new and reactivated accounts were for people unaffected by the strike, but others were for union actors like Mr. Jackson and Alyssa Milano. Fran Drescher, the SAG-AFTRA president, also reactivated her account, according to Cameo, though it is not currently accepting bookings.
Ms. Milano, 50, who charges $ 250 for a video message, said in an email that Cameo "is a great way to supplement some income during this idle time." Ms. Drescher's representatives said she was unavailable to comment for this article.
While the actors' union is on strike, its members are forbidden from filming most projects and from promoting most projects at movie premieres, film festivals and events like Comic-Con. But making Cameo videos, for the most part, is allowed, said Sue-Anne Morrow, the national director of contract strategic initiatives and podcasts at SAG-AFTRA.
"As long as there's no promotion of struck work within the Cameo, there's no problem," Ms. Morrow said in an email.
In May, around the time that movie and television writers' unions went on strike, the actors' union finalized a deal with Cameo that allows its members to have earnings from certain bookings applied toward their health insurance minimum earnings requirement, Ms. Morrow said. Those bookings must be made through Cameo 4 Business, where corporate customers like insurance companies and grocery store chains hire talent for promotional videos.
Ms. Morrow said that the union pursued the agreement because Cameo is one of many ways actors can support themselves when they're not acting.
The average price of a Cameo 4 Business booking is $ 1,700, said Steven Galanis, a founder of Cameo and its chief executive. Non-business bookings -- the types of videos Cameo is most known for -- average $ 70. Cameo receives 25 percent of the fee for any booking, and the rest goes to the talent.
Mr. Galanis compared the opportunity created by the strike for Cameo to the period of time in the early pandemic when, as he put it, "every other income sort of dried up" for actors and other entertainers. "I'm hoping that the strike ends tomorrow," he said. "But if it doesn't, we're going to be here."
On July 18, days after the actors' union went on strike, Cameo announced a round of layoffs, which happened a little more than a year after the company laid off 87 workers in May 2022. Mr. Galanis declined to comment on the number of people affected by the recent layoffs, or on the number of people now working at Cameo.
Some actors who have started reusing the service since the strike said that making money was not the only reason that they returned to it. Christa B. Allen, who has appeared in the TV show "Revenge" and in the film "13 Going on 30," said that Cameo offers an opportunity to engage with fans at a time when she is making fewer public appearances.
"We're nothing without our fans," she said. Cameo, she added, lets actors "connect with the people that love them and have supported their career in a time when they're not going to be making traditional media."
Ms. Allen, 31, who uses the stage name Christa Belle, reactivated her Cameo account during the strike after using it sporadically since 2017. She charges $ 75 per booking and said she has made about $ 1,000 to date.
"Cameo is not something I think of as a moneymaker," she said.

Roger Federer Is Winning Retirement: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tennis star and Jonathan Anderson have teamed up with Uniqlo to create a sports-inspired fashion collection.
On Wednesday morning a crowd gathered outside the Uniqlo flagship store on Fifth Avenue hoping to catch a glimpse of Roger Federer.
The tennis player, who retired in 2022, was inside introducing his first fashion collection, which he designed with Jonathan Anderson. It will be sold by Uniqlo starting Aug. 28, the first day of the U.S. Open.
Mr. Federer, 41, has long sold hats and T-shirts with his RF logo, but this project is different. The collection includes fast-drying polo shorts, fleece zip-up jackets and nylon joggers.
"They have more of a '90s look," Mr. Federer said about the joggers. "I grew up in them, and bringing them back was a lot of fun."
Mr. Federer was involved in almost all the details, from fabric to zippers. "For me it was important to get a feeling with Jonathan that I would still have my own style, and knowing how much say I would actually have instead of him saying, 'Do you like this?' and me saying, 'Yes I do,' and then we move on," he said.
Mr. Federer knew Mr. Anderson from mutual friends in the fashion world. "He is the hottest designer out there," Mr. Federer said. "He's done stuff in the past with Uniqlo. When the idea came up for us to work together, I was very excited."
On the morning of the introduction, Mr. Federer seemed happy and relaxed as he showed off his new clothes. Designing clothes, after all, isn't the only thing he has been doing in retirement. He has been traveling with his family, hopping onstage at concerts, even attending Grand Slam tournaments as a spectator.
In the edited interview below, Mr. Federer talks about his life in retirement.
Why did you want to create your own collection?
We have such a great style history in tennis. René Lacoste and Stan Smith were wonderful tennis players. I feel it's important to remember where we came from. And if I can make tennis look stylish, I think I should do that.
My collection is designed to be worn while you are playing or afterward. It's been difficult for some reason, I don't know why, to do this crossover -- from on court to off court. Not the sweaty look, of course, but let's say you don't sweat, you can still wear my clothes to walk on the street and look stylish.
What was the hardest part about creating a collection?
The starting point is the one that gets me the most nervous. It's important to give the collection a direction and know where you want to end up.
Were you worried about retiring and what it would do to your fan base?
I always feel like I've reached a high point, and then it keeps going.
Life without the game, and life without the fans, and life without the schedule that has dominated my life for 25 years has definitely been something I didn't know how I would take. For the longest time I tried to come back and give it one more shot and leave the game healthy, but it was not doable.
But the good/bad thing about Covid, and with my knee surgery, is that everything started to slow down in the past three years, so it wasn't like I came from playing 100 matches and then boom, it's over.
At the end I was relieved, I think, and happy to retire. It ended in the most perfect way at the Laver Cup. I was surrounded by my biggest rivals, and my family was there and my friends. For me it felt like, "OK, I'm good now. I don't need to chase that itch anymore."
You returned to Wimbledon this year, where you watched Andy Murray play from the Royal Box. What was it like to be a spectator?
Last year I walked out on Centre Court for the 100-year anniversary celebration. It was beautiful but painful. I was injured. I didn't know if I was going to be able to play again, so it was a very emotional moment. But this year was totally different. My dad whispered to me, "Don't you wish you were playing on court instead of sitting and watching?" and I was like, "No. I feel content watching and enjoying the game."
It was so fun sitting next to Princess Catherine. I know her quite well. She is an avid tennis fan, and she plays herself. Sometimes we have to be careful we don't speak too much. You can talk, and then it's super-quiet, and then you have to applaud.
You've been spending a lot of time in New York City this year, co-chairing the Met Gala, posting pictures of yourself on Instagram eating cheeseburgers. Do you feel the city has changed since before the pandemic?
I've always been strict and serious about being a professional athlete, but I would eat burgers, I would eat desserts, I would have a glass of wine. For me having a burger was nothing out of the ordinary, but this one was perfect looking, so I had to post a picture of it.
I was so busy when I came for the Met Gala. I feel the buzz is back.
In July, you got onstage at a Coldplay concert in Zurich, where you played a shaker. How did that happen?
I met the band when I saw them in Montreal. I don't know what year it was -- maybe 2016? We've been in touch a bit. I've seen Chris Martin in the Hamptons several times. So when they came to Zurich, I reached out and said, "I'm so excited, I would love to come." Chris wrote me back and asked if I wanted to come onstage.
I asked my daughter at dinner, and she looked at me and said: "You have to do this. You only live once." So I told Chris, "I'm in." I didn't even know what I had signed up for.
Is there a side of you away from being a tennis player that you want people to see now?
I started doing more trips that are fun with the family. I took my kids to Lesotho for my foundation's trip to Africa. We went to the Met Gala. We went on the Orient Express with my parents, things that were just not doable when I played because it took too much time away from the game.
So different sorts of photos are coming out of me, and it's nice to realize that people are still happy to see me.

Pee-wee's Precursor Had a Similar Style: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Paul Reubens's trademark style took plenty of its inspiration from a performer long forgotten.
Origin stories are notoriously hard to pin down in the humor business, since only the creator knows where the joke began. Lineages, on the other hand, are a lot easier to trace. The comedian Paul Reubens, a.k.a. Pee-wee Herman, who died this week of cancer at 70, belongs to a long line of American comics stretching back to the golden age of television and, beyond it, to the early days of vaudeville and burlesque.
Though Pinky Lee is an unfamiliar name today, it would not have been to a man of Mr. Reubens's generation. As a baby boomer, he would surely have grown up on the televised antics of a comedian famed for many of the same tics, bits and gimmicks that Mr. Reubens would later adopt -- beginning with an absurdist stage name.
Pee-wee Herman was born Paul Rubenfeld in 1952 in Peekskill, NY; Mr. Lee was born Pincus Leff in 1907 in Saint Paul, Minn. Rubenfeld, who was a talented child actor, would rename himself Reubens and become an improv comic. His early work with the The Groundlings in Los Angeles, notably in a Pinky parody skit, would eventually form the basis for one of the more indelible characters in show business. Mr. Lee came up through the ranks as a tap dancer on the vaudeville circuit. After turning to comedy routines, he made a tidy if minor career for himself as a supporting player in films like "Lady of Burlesque" (a nutty 1943 mystery that centers on a G-string as a murder weapon). He also starred in a series of westerns with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, including the eminently forgettable "South of Caliente" (1951), in which Lee took fourth billing, beneath the screen cowboy's palomino, Trigger.
So much of what we think of as uniquely Pee-wee Herman can be readily traced to Pinky Lee: There was the shrunken child's-size hat his character wore, the rapid-fire way of talking. There were also his goofy, mincing soft-shoe dances, his trademark lisp. And there was a signature catchphrase -- a version of the slowburn comeback echoing in the mind of every subteen.
"Oooooh! You make me so mad!" Pinky Lee would say.
"I know you are, but what am I?" was the Pee-wee Herman version.
A forerunner of "Pee-wee's Playhouse," "The Pinky Lee Show" ran during the 1950s before "The Howdy Doody Show," a top-rated afterschool television program starring a gaptoothed, flame-haired and rubber-faced ventriloquist's dummy.
"Yoo-hoo, it's me," went the opening theme song Mr. Lee performed (sang is not quite the word): "I skip and run and bring lots of fun/To every she and he/It's plain to see that you can tell it's me/In my checkered hat and my checkered coat."
And then there was the outfit.
Pinky Lee slicked down his hair and wore mismatched checkered shirts and jackets; baggy pegged trousers; a neatly knotted four-in-hand necktie; and a permanently supercilious expression.
Mr. Reubens as Pee-wee Herman pomaded his hair, wore a suit, albeit with shrunken proportions (the jacket too snug, the pants hemmed to floodwater height, the neckwear a fussy bow-tie), and had a permanently supercilious expression. The air of disbelief, the prissily crossed told-you-so arms, even the moue that Mr. Reubens affected were all, it would appear, studiously adapted. As Pee-wee later would in his television comedy, Pinky delighted in playing opposite inanimate objects, among them the lovable, bendable humanoid Claymation character Gumby.
And so it seems only just, as Instagram and the rest of the internet mourns Mr. Reubens's Pee-wee, to give a tip of the shrunken, roll-brimmed pork pie to his progenitor, Mr. Leff's Pinky.

Paris in Her Sights, Biles Is Set to Return To Elite Competition: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Biles, the decorated American gymnast, is making her return to elite competition on Saturday at the U.S. Classic. The field also includes Sunisa Lee, the reigning Olympic all-around champion.
Simone Biles, who over the past decade has revolutionized what is possible in gymnastics, is set to compete Saturday for the first time since 2021, when she won two medals at the Tokyo Olympics but also withdrew from five events to protect her mental and physical health.
Gymnastics fans have been waiting for this moment, which is widely seen as her first step toward the Paris Games in 2024. The competition, the U.S. Classic, sold out weeks ago. That is almost certainly because of Biles, 26, who could break multiple world and Olympic records in the next year.
This meet -- which serves as the last opportunity for athletes to qualify for the national championships later this month -- is fielding its best lineup ever. The entrants hold a cumulative 55 medals from the Olympics and world championships, according to a tally by the podcast GymCastic.
Biles owns 32 of those medals. Her power, strength and speed are unmatched, and she can execute moves that no other woman can, including a double back flip with three twists on floor exercise and a vault called a Yurchenko double pike.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An original skill that Biles debuted in 2019 -- a beam dismount of a double-twisting double back flip -- was so difficult that the international gymnastics federation assigned it a lower point value than many expected, explaining that it was risky and that the group must ensure the safety of all gymnasts. A similarly lower point value was assigned to Biles's double pike vault.
If history is any indicator, Biles should return in good form this weekend despite her hiatus from elite competition. After the Rio Games in 2016, she took two years off before winning the all-around title at the 2018 national championships by 6.55 points, a formidable margin. She then earned a total of 11 medals at the next two world championships. Nine of them were gold.
But in Tokyo, Biles had a case of what gymnasts call the "twisties," a mind-body disconnect midair. She was unable to perform and land skills safely, and chose to forgo the all-around, vault, uneven bars and floor exercise finals. She left Japan with a silver medal in the team event and a bronze on the balance beam.
Some wondered if Biles would leave the sport for good. In late 2021, she headlined her own 35-city gymnastics tour. Earlier this year, she married Jonathan Owens, a defensive back with the Green Bay Packers. She traveled to warm, sunny destinations with groups of girlfriends, and she and Owens began building a house.
She also has been focusing specifically on her mental health, saying on Instagram that therapy was a priority. "I go once a week for almost 2 hrs," she wrote. "I've had so much trauma, so being able to work on some of the traumas & work on healing is a blessing."
About a month ago, Biles confirmed that she was seriously training again and would compete in the U.S. Classic. For her, the event is essentially a warm-up: She is all but certain to vie for what would be her eighth national all-around title in San Jose, Calif., on Aug. 27.
The world championships in Belgium would follow in the fall. And by next summer, it is possible that the U.S. team would be the strongest in history. The Olympic medalists Sunisa Lee, Gabrielle Douglas, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles, as well as the Olympic alternates Leanne Wong and Kayla DiCello, are trying to earn spots on the five-person squad that will head to Paris.
Douglas, 27, the all-around champion in 2012 and a team gold medalist in 2016, is the only gymnast among them who is not competing until next year. She announced her return to the sport last month.
Lee, the reigning Olympic all-around champion and one of the best uneven bars workers in the world, is expected to perform on at least two apparatuses at the Classic. But her path forward is not as clear as that of Biles.
Lee, who goes by Suni, cut short her collegiate career at Auburn and is dealing with what was described as kidney issues. The rules say that if she competes in only two events this weekend, she must score well and file a petition with U.S.A. Gymnastics that allows her to advance to the national championships and possibly the world championships.
If Biles and Lee both head to Belgium, they would be the first Olympic all-around champions to compete on the same world championship team, said Jessica O'Beirne, a host of GymCastic. "It would send gymnastics fans into an utter fan ecstasy," she said.
On Saturday, they will perform in the evening session at the Classic, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern time. The event will be streamed live on Peacock and aired on CNBC.

Judge Limits Scope of Trial Vs. Google: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The ruling did not affect some central parts of the antitrust cases about Google search, which are scheduled to go to trial next month.
A federal judge said this week that the Justice Department and a group of states could not move forward with some claims in antitrust complaints against Google, narrowing the scope of what is set to be the most significant federal monopoly trial against a tech giant in decades.
In the decision, which was unsealed on Friday, Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed four claims in the lawsuits and allowed government lawyers to move forward with three.
Judge Mehta wrote that a trial was warranted to assess whether Google's exclusivity deals for web browsers and preloading its services on Android devices illegally helped the internet company maintain a monopoly. But he said the government had not "demonstrated the requisite anticompetitive effect" to prove that Google broke the law in other ways, such as by boosting its own products in search results over those of specialized sites, like Amazon and Yelp.
The decision sets the stage for the first major tech monopoly trial since the federal government took Microsoft to court in the 1990s, amid a renewed backlash over the power of tech giants. In recent years, American regulators have filed lawsuits and tried to block the acquisitions of companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as they have grown in reach and size.
Some efforts by regulators to challenge the tech giants have faltered. Twice this year, federal judges have declined to grant Federal Trade Commission requests to stop tech deals, allowing Meta to close the purchase of a virtual reality start-up and clearing the way for Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
But the Google trial, which is scheduled to begin on Sept. 12, stands out as the most direct government attempt in years to confront one of the world's biggest tech companies about longtime business practices. The trial is expected to last almost 10 weeks and to scrutinize not only how Google conducts business but its relationships with other major companies, such as Apple and Samsung, which have largely been shrouded in secrecy.
Bill Baer, a former Justice Department antitrust official, said the cases were as significant as the landmark litigation against Microsoft.
The outcome "will set an important precedent about whether these dominant tech platforms are engaging in behavior that limits competition and disadvantages consumers," he said.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in a statement on Friday that the company appreciated Judge Mehta's "careful consideration and decision to dismiss claims regarding the design of Google Search."
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
The department filed an antitrust case against Google under President Donald J. Trump in 2020. It argues that the Silicon Valley company exploits its power over online search and the ads that appear in search results. The lawsuit was ultimately combined for trial with a separate case about Google search that was filed that same year by the attorneys general of 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.
The Justice Department has separately filed another antitrust case against Google, focused on the company's software for placing ads across the web, which is headed to trial as soon as next year.
In his ruling, Judge Mehta allowed the core of the Justice Department's case to stand. But he dismissed three of the agency's claims regarding Google's management of the Android operating system, its relationships to phone makers that use Android and its Google Assistant service. He also threw out a central claim brought by the states, which accused Google of providing top billing in its search results to its own products.
Judge Mehta acknowledged in his opinion that Google was extremely popular and noted the bar that government lawyers must clear to prove that it had broken antitrust rules.
It is not illegal for Google to have a monopoly alone, he wrote, adding, "A company with monopoly power acts unlawfully only when its conduct stifles competition."
At trial, both sides are set to argue over whether the company's multibillion-dollar agreements to be the default search engine on various devices and browsers are anticompetitive, which could have significant consequences for its core business. Google's search engine collected $ 162 billion in advertising revenue last year.
Google has argued that these pacts with companies like Apple and Samsung are simple distribution deals that are common in business, and that the government has tried to penalize Google because of its popularity.
The agreements have been a linchpin in Google's efforts to be easily accessible to large audiences. The company retains an estimated 94 percent of search engine traffic on mobile devices, according to Similarweb, a data analysis firm.

Full text: Anheuser-Busch InBev is struggling in the United States after a conservative-led boycott of Bud Light, leaving other brands in the company's portfolio to pick up the slack.
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the global beer-making giant, on Thursday reported a sharp drop in sales and profit in the United States, as it counted the cost of a conservative-led boycott of Bud Light after the company's collaboration with a transgender influencer.
Anheuser-Busch said its revenue in the United States last quarter fell more than 10 percent from year earlier, "primarily due to the volume decline of Bud Light." Operating profit at the U.S. unit dropped nearly 30 percent.
Bud Light has faced a backlash from conservative commentators and celebrities after Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer, posted a promotion for the beer on Instagram in April. Anheuser-Busch later put some marketing executives on leave and announced layoffs in its corporate offices.
"People want to enjoy their beer without the debate," Michel Doukeris, the chief executive of Anheuser-Busch, told analysts on Thursday. He said the company would focus on promoting its beers through its partnerships with sports leagues and nonprofits that support military families and farmers.
Modelo Especial dethroned Bud Light as the nation's top-selling beer in June. Constellation Brands, which sells Modelo in the United States, reported 7.5 percent growth in beer volumes in its most recent quarter, which ended on May 31, compared with a year earlier. Overall volume at Anheuser-Busch, which also sells Beck's, Michelob, Stella Artois and many other brands, fell more than 1 percent in the three months through June.
Bud Light has been losing market share because of the backlash. Anheuser-Busch noted, however, that the share of sales of its brands in the United States had stabilized by the end of the quarter.
Sales of the conglomerate's other beers, in other countries, helped bolster its results, with total revenue last quarter up just over 7 percent and a measure of profit gaining 5 percent, beating analysts' expectations. The company, which is based in Belgium, reiterated its forecast for profit growth of up to 8 percent this year, in part because it has been raising prices. Its share price rose more than 1 percent.
Sticking with its profit forecast "should provide relief to investors who have been waiting on the sidelines to see if the Bud Light situation would drive a reset of expectations," analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a research report. They warned that the "full hit" of Bud Light's troubles would appear in the company's next quarterly report.
Retail sales of Bud Light fell as much as 42 percent in some U.S. metro areas in the four weeks that ended on July 22, according to Nielsen IQ data analyzed by the consulting firm Bump Williams. Customers at bars and restaurants have also ordered Bud Light less frequently, sending sales down 34 percent last quarter, according to data from Union, an ordering system used at more than 1,000 bars and restaurants in 34 states.
Bud Light has lost its top spot at these establishments, falling to fourth place, behind Miller Lite, Michelob Ultra and Coors Light, according to Union.
Molson Coors, which owns Coors Light and Miller Lite, on Tuesday reported record quarterly sales and a big jump in profit. The company's chief executive, Gavin Hattersley, told analysts that in the second quarter last year, Bud Light sold more than Coors Light and Miller Lite combined. In the second quarter this year, he said, Coors and Miller racked up 50 percent more in sales than Bud Light.

In Online Dating, Distrust and Verifying Potential Mates: [Style Desk]

Full text: Facebook groups like Vouched Dating and Are We Dating the Same Guy? help strangers vet potential partners.
These days the idea of meeting a perfect stranger doesn't quite hold the romantic allure it once did (if it ever really did at all). Especially when it comes to online dating. Before apps like Tinder, it was common for people to meet potential mates in their neighborhood, or through school, work or religious institutions. The internet, however, provides a much larger dating pool, which can reduce the chances of two people having mutual friends.
With 30 percent of U.S. adults using dating platforms, according to a survey by Pew Research Center, how can people verify if someone is datable? In a time where scams run amok on the internet, some single people are taking matters of verification into their own hands.
Most dating platforms require users to import photos and basic information about themselves. The platforms also allow users to link to their social media profiles, but it's impossible to know everything about person based on those cues alone.
Last year, Lissie Pinckney, who lives in Los Angeles, joined a Facebook group called Vouched Dating -- Los Angeles, where mostly straight women tout their platonic male friends. Different versions of the group exist in cities across the country, including Jersey City and Minneapolis.
On the vouch dating groups, women post a few pictures of their guy friends, adding details about who the guy is and who he's looking for, Ms. Pinckney, said. "And then women can comment if they're interested," she said.
The friend then shares the potential matches with her guy friend and makes the connection if it's a fit. These groups provide the women with a sense of security. The posts act as endorsements -- like Yelp reviews for potential mates.
Approaching the issue of verification from the opposite side of the coin, popular Facebook groups known as Are We Dating the Same Guy? serve as forums for women to see if the men they are dating are trustworthy. Members in those groups will share an image and brief details about a guy they are seeing along with one single inquiry: Is he taken? Others will post photos of their bad exes in an effort to warn other women. (Similar groups exist for men, called "Are We Dating the Same Girl?")
These forums originated with the intention of helping women look out for other women. But Are We Dating The Same Guy groups -- there are more than 150 in different cities around the world -- have become increasingly criticized for divisiveness, toxicity, defamation and privacy issues. Lawyers have warned that these pages could put posters at risk of legal action, and there is at least one petition on change.org demanding that the groups be shut down.
Dating apps have long grappled with verification features. Some, like Hinge and Raya, use various strategies to make potential matches feel less like strangers.
Hinge once used a "romance graph" to pair you with friends of friends that fit your style. Raya, the membership-based app for dating and professional networking, requires users to link their Instagram profiles to their pages. Aspiring members must apply to join (a referral from a current member can boost the chances of being accepted).
According to Madeleine Fugère, a social psychologist and psychological science professor at Eastern Connecticut State University, these attempts to verify dates via groups or mutual friends or family members could signal "a backlash" to internet dating and the problems associated with it.
"Because of the anonymity that the internet offers, there's a lot of people who behave badly," said Dr. Fugère, who specializes in human attraction and romantic relationships.
"It's much harder to behave in that way if you're not only accountable to your potential date, but also to a friend or family member," she added.
Ms. Pinckney attended a Vouched Dating party in August that was hosted by the Los Angeles group of which she is a member. She followed the rules of the party and brought a couple of her guy friends she could vouch for.
"The ladies all seemed spectacular," she said. "There were a couple of very eligible men that all the women wanted to talk to." But she added that most of the men were "lackluster."
However, one of the men she brought, Chazztin Pascual, a 36-year-old software engineer, hit it off with a woman named Trinity Gruenberg, 32.
"Once we met, we talked literally the whole day," Mr. Pascual said. "We went from one side of the venue to the other, and then we ended up outside."
They had their first official date less than a week later, and he soon asked her to be his girlfriend. They now live in the Bay Area, recently got engaged in Hawaii and are planning to get married next year.
"I liked that it was more of a traditional approach," Ms. Gruenberg said. "Like the whole goal was that it was a dating event. I really liked that.
Dr. Fugère explained that another reason it's important to meet in-person, regardless of how you connect, is because when we're in a digital environment, we have a tendency to project characteristics onto a potential partner and assume they're going to be good rather than bad. Instead, she said, we should determine if they really have positive characteristics or if we're "inventing those in the absence of real information."
Mr. Pascual said that the experience emphasized why going through friends to find a romantic partner, especially if it's a female friend, may make women feel safer because it can lessen the fear that he's a misogynist.
"I know at least a handful of guys, like I've worked with, that I would not trust anywhere near my sisters," said Mr. Pascual, who has six sisters. "Just the fact that a guy would have a female friend that can vouch for him is a plus in itself."

The Chill Necklace for a 'Hot Girl Summer': [Style Desk]

Full text: Taylor Sade is the founder of Vertigo, which sells chokers, pendants and belts made of beads that look as if they were plucked from the beach.
By day, Taylor Sade, 24, is a marketing manager. But after work hours, she hand-strings beads and stones on her bed in her Lower East Side apartment, cradled next to her two Himalayan cats. Those creations eventually add up to Vertigo, the buzzy brand behind the accessory draping the necks and waists of many young women this summer.
"I've always loved solitary activities," Ms. Sade said in an interview from her studio, pointing to a stack of puzzles and knitting equipment sandwiched between tattered books in her living room.
That do-it-yourself quality applies more broadly to the bohemian appeal of Vertigo. The brand sells a collection of chokers, pendants and belts made of oversize beads that look as if they were plucked from the sand. The accessories, which cost $ 120 to $ 380, are often dark-hued but also glint in brighter colors, and they've shown up on many bikini-clad beachgoers -- an embodiment of a self-assurance often associated with a "Hot Girl Summer."
Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, a contributing editor at Vogue, said Vertigo inspired a feeling of nostalgia and evoked a bygone era that's hard to place. A Vertigo girl is someone who "didn't shop at Hollister and might not have been popular because of it, but she knew what was cool decades before the rest of us," Ms. Karefa-Johnson said.
Ms. Sade said she had never strung a bead before starting the company in the summer of 2021. At the time, she was searching for a creative respite from her full-time job and recalled watching videos about how to string necklaces. "I literally just went onto YouTube one day -- it sounds so silly," she said.
For the first six months, Ms. Sade sourced materials from Phoenix, where she is from and where her family lives. Her mother would video chat her daughter as she visited local jewelers in her stead. "I'd be like, 'I want this jade, not that one!"' Ms. Sade said. "Then she'd ship over a box, and I'd Venmo her."
No pieces look exactly the same, because each stone, bead and jewel varies in color and shape. "The styles are one-of-a-kind and made in very limited quantities, adding a sense of individualism," said Brandon Tan, a stylist and fashion editor for GQ. "These days in the fashion landscape, that's extremely desirable."
This quality has helped land Vertigo in Sports Illustrated, a Victoria's Secret ad and a Frankies Bikini billboard in SoHo. In a shoot in May for Mirror Palais, a women's wear company, Emily Ratajkowski wore one of the pendants, featuring a large lapis doughnut-shaped stone tied as a choker. The campaign garnered millions of views on Mirror Palais's Instagram account, which helped put Vertigo on the map, Ms. Sade said. Vertigo has also caught the eye of several celebrity stylists, who have requested accessories for their clients like the model Gigi Hadid and the TikTok influencer Alix Earle.
Ms. Sade keeps her operations relatively modest, though she no longer relies on her mother for help. Instead she negotiates with Arizona-based lapidaries via email and over the phone, accumulating one box at a time in her studio apartment (which is all she has space for, she noted). Recently, she started sourcing more ornate options like fossilized coral, opal eye and green jade from Indonesia.
While hesitant to expand the company, Ms. Sade said she hired an intern in April to help her string beads. "My problem is, I don't trust anybody else to execute my vision," she said.
Ms. Sade oversees the entire process of creating a Vertigo accessory and attributes the brand's success to her attention to detail, down to the very last moment the product ships from her home to the next.
"I have people directly messaging me, 'This is the most beautiful package I've ever received,"' she said. "And it literally sounds like a joke, but it's because I spent five minutes wrapping your suede cord into a bow!"

Trudeau Splits From His Wife After 18 Years: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Canadian prime minister and his wife have been married for 18 years and share three children.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada announced on Wednesday that he and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, had separated after 18 years of marriage.
The Trudeaus, who have three children, have "signed a legal separation agreement," according to a statement released by the prime minister's office.
"As always, we remain a close family with deep love and respect for each other and for everything we have built and will continue to build. For the well-being of our children, we ask that you respect our privacy and their privacy," Mr. Trudeau said in a post on Instagram.
He added that they had decided to separate "after many meaningful and difficult conversations."
Mr. Trudeau's wife and children have played a prominent role in his political career, often accompanying him on trips overseas after he was elected prime minister in 2015. Their children are Xavier, 15, Ella-Grace, 14, and Hadrien, 9.
His young children have helped craft an image of Mr. Trudeau, now 51, as a youthful, vigorous leader. His wife, 48, is a former television presenter and helped burnish his image further with a touch of glamour.
The prime minister's office said that the couple "are focused on raising their kids in a safe, loving and collaborative environment." It added that they "will be a constant presence in their children's lives" and that the family planned to vacation together next week.
"Canadians can expect to often see the family together," the office said.
The couple met in Montreal in 2002 and were married three years later, after Mr. Trudeau, who had spent years teaching in Vancouver, returned to Montreal.
Nelson Wiseman, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, said that while Ms. Grégoire Trudeau prominently accompanied her husband at public events after he became prime minister, her appearances had more recently decreased notably.
Even though the role of family man was an integral part of Mr. Trudeau's carefully crafted image, Mr. Wiseman said he foresaw no political fallout from the separation.
"Canadian voters don't care about that," he said. "Once upon a time, they did. But the culture and times have changed."
Mr. Wiseman pointed out that even Mr. Trudeau's father, Pierre, did not suffer politically after he separated in 1977 from his wife, Margaret, the current prime minister's mother. Pierre Trudeau served as prime minister nearly continuously from 1968 to 1984.
The announcement came as Mr. Trudeau overhauled his cabinet last week, shuffling ministers in key portfolios to inject what he called "fresh energy" into the team. Political analysts say it's an attempt to get his party in fighting form for the next scheduled election in 2025, with recent polls showing that Mr. Trudeau's Liberal Party is lagging behind the Conservatives.

Full text: An Italian restaurant with a little elbow room? No problem.
Hi friends, I hope you all made it through this weekend's heat wave in good shape. (I ran straight to the beach.) I'm back with another edition of reader questions and, boy, do we have an interesting mix this month. There's a visitor from the South searching for "decent Thai" -- and we can do much better than decent. Another reader wants to know where to enjoy cozy Italian dining, minus the physical closeness to other diners. And finally, someone seeking bistro lunchtime options near the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a gossip session.
As always, please send along your own reader questions (or responses) to wheretoeat@nytimes.com, and you may see it featured here. Thanks!
A Thai food tour
Our South Carolina friends and I will be in N.Y.C. in early October and will be visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Not having a decent Thai restaurant anywhere in S.C., we are longing to dine at one when there. Would you recommend one for us to enjoy and truly savor? -- Michael B.
Because you'll be on the Upper East Side, I'll recommend Up Thai, near 72nd Street and Second Avenue. They have a really fun cocktail menu and better-than-decent Thai. But consider branching out: For world-class Isan (or Northern Thai), you should go to Elmhurst, Queens, or Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and visit Zaab Zaab. Goong pow, or sausage-size prawns, anyone? If you want Thai food that will make you cry because it's so good (and so spicy), head to Ugly Baby, in Carroll Gardens -- get whatever panang curry is available at the moment. And for excellent Thai in Manhattan, I highly recommend Somtum Der on Avenue A. If I knew tomorrow would be my last day on Earth, I'd have their pad se eiw nue as one of my last meals.
Give me some room
I love eating in the city, but I become uncomfortable sitting too close to strangers. The coziest-hole-in-the-wall restaurants are a favorite, and as a vegetarian, I tend toward Italian for those easy-to-predict pasta dishes. I am inevitably sat so close to the next group that my bum almost sweeps their meal off their table when I rise to use the restroom. Asking for spacious but cozy is a hard ask. Is it possible to get romantic and cozy without bumping elbows with couples on both sides? -- Dave and Valerie
Love a niche question. I'll start with this: If you want space, dine out early or late. I've had entire restaurants to myself at 5:30 or 6 in the evening. Now my recommendations: Jupiter, which has the square footage benefit of being in Rockefeller Center, has relatively private velvet booths that are a feast for the eyes. Consume as many zucchini fries as possible before getting the tortellini with butter and Parm. Alternatively, try Altro Paradiso on the SoHo-Hudson Square border, one of the more airy Italian restaurants in the city. As I said two weeks back, the tomato crop is glorious this year, so go for the spaghetti pomodoro.
Lunchtime debrief near the Met
Can you recommend a good bistro or restaurant in walking distance from the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Going to the Lagerfeld fashion exhibit with three friends and we'll have plenty to discuss over a tasty lunch. Thank you! -- Joanne M.
Plenty to discuss? OK, tea! In another life, I would have recommended the nearby Café Sabarsky, but it's closed through the end of August. So, I'll recommend a restaurant that is near and dear to my sister, a longtime resident of the Upper East Side: Café D'Alsace. We've gone there a few times for brunch and ordered the burger d'alsace with caramelized onions (and Alsatian Munster, if you so please), as well as the schnitzel.
In Other News ...
An update: Last week, I shared that the East Village restaurant Claud would temporarily become a daytime bakery because of issues with its liquor license. Those issues have since been resolved and, as of Sunday, Claud is operating as a full-service restaurant.
This week, Pete Wells reviews Artesano, where the chef Rodrigo Fernandini serves "intelligently assembled" takes on ceviches, tiraditos and other Peruvian dishes.
Openings: Akram Nassir, a pilot and an owner of Yemen Café on Atlantic Avenue, has opened a third location on Staten Island; Regina's Grocery, a Lower East Side staple, has a new branch on South Third Street and Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and starting Aug. 14, dine on a 105-foot schooner in the New York Harbor with Marea at Sea.
Ella Quittner took a survey of the latest dining aesthetic: restaurants lit entirely in the color red, like a darkroom.
Marnie Hanel writes about the rebranding of Diamond Crystal kosher salt, a longtime favorite of professional chefs, as a more approachable ingredient for "the aspiring home chef."

Full text: The Center for Countering Digital Hate said it had received a letter from X, Twitter's parent company, accusing it of trying to hurt the social platform with its research.
Elon Musk has over the last year threatened legal action against tech competitors, employees and people who use Twitter, which he owns. Now he is also taking aim at an organization that studies hate speech and misinformation on social media.
X Corp., the parent company of the social media company, sent a letter on July 20 to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that conducts research on social media, accusing the organization of making "a series of troubling and baseless claims that appear calculated to harm Twitter generally, and its digital advertising business specifically," and threatening to sue.
The letter cited research published by the Center for Countering Digital Hate in June examining hate speech on Twitter, which Mr. Musk has renamed X.com. The research consisted of eight papers, including one that found that Twitter had taken no action against 99 percent of the 100 Twitter Blue accounts the center reported for "tweeting hate." The letter called the research "false, misleading or both" and said the organization had used improper methodology.
The letter added that the center was funded by Twitter's competitors or foreign governments "in support of an ulterior agenda."
Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said, "Elon Musk's actions represent a brazen attempt to silence honest criticism and independent research." He added that Mr. Musk wanted to "stem the tide of negative stories and rebuild his relationship with advertisers."
The center also said it did "not accept any funding from tech companies, governments, or their affiliates."
In a blog post Monday evening, X announced that it had filed a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate for "actively working to prevent free expression." The suit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California.
Twitter's advertising business has been struggling under the ownership of Mr. Musk, who bought the company last year. U.S. ad revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $ 88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier. Advertisers may have been spooked by Mr. Musk's changes to the social network, including the removal of rules of what can or can't be said on the service and more ads featuring online gambling and marijuana products.
In May, Mr. Musk hired Linda Yaccarino, a former top advertising executive for NBCUniversal, to become Twitter's chief executive.
The letter was at least the third legal threat or action by X Corp. in the last two months. In May, it sent a letter to Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, accusing the tech giant of improperly using its data. This month, it also sent a letter to Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, saying it had copied Twitter's trade secrets when creating Threads, a new social app.
X also sued Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a leading corporate law firm, this month over what it said were unjust payments related to Mr. Musk's $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter.

A Bourbon Lover Likes a Splash of Water: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Kate Rosante, who co-founded the bourbon company Boss Molly, makes themed cocktails for movie nights at her summer house in Amagansett.
Kate Rosante's passion for cocktails is thanks to her father, who built a bar in the living room of her childhood home. "I loved gathering around the guests and fetching drinks," said Ms. Rosante, 43, a co-founder of the bourbon brand Boss Molly (slang for a stubborn female mule). "As a kid growing up in the suburbs in Long Island, that felt special."
Ms. Rosante, who is also a vice president of marketing production operations at the cable network A&E, said the idea for Boss Molly was born during a poker game in 2017 with her friends and co-founders Brandi Bowles and Victoria Horn. "The bourbon world is hypermasculine and very niche," she said. "We have respect for the tradition, but we didn't feel it spoke to us. We wanted to open it up to more people."
Ms. Rosante lives in a one-bedroom apartment at 92nd Street and Lexington Avenue with her husband, Adam Rosante, 43, a fitness trainer and influencer who created Good Eats, a nonprofit that gives schoolchildren food on weekends. For the past seven years they have spent their summers in Amagansett, where they own a two-bedroom 1940s cottage.
MORNING MEDITATION I'm up at 7:30 or 8 a.m. Adam gets up before me and meditates in the other room. I do 10 minutes of meditation breath work in bed. It sets my day with an intention. I feed our two rescue cats, Sabrina and BB, then get the cold brew coffee I made the night before. We buy beans from Cashin Coffee Roasters, a local coffee roaster in Montauk. I add half-and-half. I grew up with full fat -- it's my Irish roots.
KITCHEN BALLET While Adam is at the kitchen table planning his workweek, I'll check the marine report, then get some physical activity by doing 60 to 90 minutes of ballet in the kitchen. The counter acts as the barre because I need to hold onto something that's above hip level. I have a portable rubberized floor so I'm not slipping around. Then I make a kale, peanut butter, whey protein and apple smoothie.
FRUIT FIRST If the weather is good, we drive our '66 Mustang convertible, which Adam bought off the side of the road over a Fourth of July weekend, and get berries at Amber Waves Farm. You can pick the raspberries off the bushes if they're ripe. If not, then it's already-picked blueberries, strawberry and rhubarb, which I'll use to bake a fruit crisp.
OUT ON THE WATER We pick up our boat, a 20-foot Grady-White bowrider, at Uihlein's Marina around 1 p.m. We bought it from them during Covid. We wanted something to do when we couldn't be around people. The boat is called "Seabird." Spending time out here made me appreciate birds. I became fascinated by the different gulls. Being on the water and exploring different areas -- and saving hours normally spent in car traffic by getting somewhere by boat -- became our go-to. It also connects us with the culture of Montauk, which is all fishing and boating.
FISH OF THE DAY We tool around and circle Lake Montauk, then we go through the inlet, drive into the bay and dock at Duryea's Montauk, which was an old lobster place, for lunch. It's since been bought and renovated, but they kept the spirit of the place. You get a paper menu, mark off what you want, bring it to a window and they bring the food to you. We usually order half a dozen littleneck clams and the grilled fish of the day. Their shoestring French fries are key. We eat that on the bay so you're looking out at the water.
JUMPING IN We usually shoot over to the Navy Beach pier, which is a dock jutting out into the water. We tie up the boat and then jump off the dock. It's a little scary, but it's so much fun. The water feels really good in the summer. If it's too windy for the boat, we drive to the White Sands beach in Amagansett. Most of the beaches don't have official names; they're usually named after visual markers or descriptors. This one is near the White Sands Hotel. Adam goes surfing in the ocean and I sit on the beach and read. I'm halfway through "Fairy Tale," by Stephen King. I'm also reading "Sag Harbor," by Colson Whitehead. It takes place in the summer on the east end of Long Island in the mid- to late '80s.
DOWNTIME We go back home and I'll nap or read in the hammock. I hang out until I feel I need to do an outdoor shower, which happens around 5 or 5:30.
BEACH DINNER We might pick up food at Dive Bar Pizza in Napeague, which is between Montauk and Amagansett. We have a portable grill, so if we don't do pizza, we get steak at Tony's Meat Market or Gosman's Market. We go to the beach and make a bonfire. Adam does the grilling, and we have dinner with friends we've made out here. Then we watch the sunset, which is magical. I don't really see sunsets in the city, and each one out here is different. It's a time to be together and appreciate the beauty of the place we're in. We normally don't talk through it.
COCKTAILS AND A FLICK We head home by 8:30 and watch TV. We finished "Succession" and "Jury Duty," which was very funny. Now we're on to movies. There's a roster of ones we've already seen, like "Jaws," "Point Break" and "Stepford Wives" (the original, not the Nicole Kidman), that are tied to the season we're in. I make my own syrups and bitters, and theme cocktails to the movies. For "Jaws" I make a New York whiskey sour with red wine. In "Stepford Wives," the women drink a lot of Scotch. I make a riff on a dry Manhattan and steep whisky in chamomile tea, then I add dry vermouth. I'll make these as Adam tees up the movie.
BEDTIME Adam and I get in bed; the cats follow. Neither one of us can sleep with the light on, so we both end up going to sleep at the same time.

Colombians Face a Brush With Death Half a World Away: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A deadly missile strike on a crowded restaurant wounded three Colombians who hope to build support for Ukraine in a continent that has avoided taking sides.
Héctor Abad Faciolince grew up in what had been one of the most violent cities on earth. Since Colombia won its independence more than 200 years ago, it has weathered political unrest, military crackdowns and violent drug cartels.
His own father, who had accused the military of sponsoring death squads, was assassinated in 1987 by paramilitary forces that had turned his hometown, Medellín, into a war zone.
But his brush with death came half a world away.
At the end of a trip last month that he and two fellow Colombians hoped could aid their quixotic quest to build support in South America for Ukraine's battle against Russia, a missile tore through a crowded restaurant where they'd just raised their glasses for a toast. At least 13 people were killed, including their guide, the Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina.
"I could only think: they killed us," Mr. Abad said. "That was the last thing I could think of."
Nearly a year and a half since Russia invaded Ukraine, much of South America has largely avoided picking sides in the war. Longstanding views that a multipolar, less-Western global order is in their best interests have prompted governments to oppose the fighting but reject attempts to isolate Russia diplomatically, impose economic sanctions or supply weapons to Ukraine.
And many average citizens, polls suggest, view the war as something too distant to care about, a proxy war between global powers doing what they've always done: impose their wills on smaller countries.
Opposition to such widespread apathy put Mr. Abad and two fellow Colombians -- Catalina Gómez Ángel, a journalist, and Sergio Jaramillo, a former defense minister who led the government's peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- unwittingly in the line of fire.
They had attended a literary conference in Kyiv, where they spoke about a campaign created by Mr. Jaramillo, "¡Aguanta Ucrania!" ("Hang On Ukraine!"), that has collected supportive videos from Latin American politicians, intellectuals and artists, including the Chilean writer Isabel Allende and the Uruguayan songwriter Jorge Drexler. So far, it has attracted a modest following: just over 4,000 followers on Twitter and Instagram combined.
But after the conference, Mr. Jaramillo said, the trio wanted to "take the campaign to the places where Ukrainians suffer most." Ms. Amelina volunteered to guide them through villages in the battle-scarred Donbas region to document stories of Ukrainian soldiers and families who had been victims of war crimes.
They hoped to tell those stories back home and promote solidarity with Ukraine, where Mr. Abad said the fight for sovereignty echoes the struggles of South American nations.
"When one defends certain freedoms of the West and Ukraine, one is also defending those of Colombia," Mr. Abad said.
They had finished their tour on a warm Tuesday last month in Kramatorsk, about 20 miles from the front line and the devastated city of Bakhmut. Ria Lounge, one of Ms. Amelina's favorite restaurants, was lively and crowded even though local officials had limited the sale of alcohol in the city, in hopes of keeping people off the streets. Instead, the companions toasted with nonalcoholic beer and apple juice.
"Victoria looked at my glass and joked: 'Looks like whisky,"' Mr. Abad said. "She smiled, and I smiled. At that moment, there were no sirens. There was no whistle, nothing. Just something like an explosion that I had never felt in my life."
Mr. Abad, Ms. Gómez and Mr. Jaramillo sustained minor injuries. But Ms. Amelina, one of Ukraine's best-known young writers, died in a hospital four days later. She was 37.
The attack prompted President Gustavo Petro of Colombia to publicly condemn Russia for the first time since the invasion, and he called on his country's foreign ministry to "deliver a diplomatic note of protest."
But three weeks later in Brussels, at a summit of European leaders and their Caribbean and Latin American counterparts, Mr. Petro chose to sit on the fence when it came to discussing the war.
He chastised the West with common refrain in South America. "No doubt there's an imperialist invasion of Ukraine. But what would you call what happened in Iraq? Or in Libya? Or in Syria?" he said. "Why does this one cause this reaction and previous ones in this century do not?"
President Gabriel Boric of Chile, one of the few South American leaders to condemn Moscow, urged his counterparts to be more assertive. "Today it is Ukraine, but tomorrow it could be any one of us," he said during the summit.
But the summit stalled as the countries couldn't agree on how to address the conflict. In their joint statement, they did not mention Russia at all, restricting their communiqué to expressing "deep concern on the ongoing war against Ukraine."
Many South American leaders have more pressing priorities, like economic stagnation and soaring inflation, and fear the potential economic fallout of taking sides. Brazil's vital agribusiness, for example, is highly dependent on Russian fertilizers.
Public interest has also waned. A recent Ipsos poll showed that attention paid to the war has receded significantly in major Latin American countries, including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, compared to many other parts of the world. A majority of people polled in the region believe that Ukraine's problems are none of their business and the survey found little support for any kind of intervention.
There is also continued distrust of the United States, which has a long history of backing regime changes in the region, including military dictatorships. It's a deeply embedded memory that should not be taken lightly, said Juan Gabriel Tokatlian, a professor of international relations and the provost of the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires.
Latin America's top concerns, he said, are inequality, poverty and pandemic recovery -- and avoiding a return to the days when the continent was caught between competing superpowers.
"Latin America lost development opportunities and experienced the dramatic costs of the Cold War," he said. "If a similar division happens now, historical memory will count. And, for Latin America, going back to a Cold War is unacceptable."
But that's exactly why supporters of Ukraine say it's crucial for Latin America to take an interest in Ukraine.
Sergio Guzmán, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, a political consultancy, said the war could reshape the global power map, and the region risks being left out by trying to take a middle path.
"If Latin America wants to have a seat at the table, it needs to get involved," he said.
While South American leaders were in Brussels, ¡Aguanta Ucrania! posters had gone up around the city. About two weeks after the missile strike on Kramatorsk, Mr. Abad, Ms. Gómez and Mr. Jaramillo visited the city to promote their initiative and attend a tribute to Ms. Amelina at the European Parliament.
Back home in Medellín, Mr. Abad said he'd begun reading the Spanish edition of Ms. Amelina's 2017 novel "Dom's Dream Kingdom."
"It's very entertaining, and you learn a lot of Ukrainian history," Mr. Abad said. "It's the story of a family in Lviv, and you learn how complex the Ukrainian identity is, as many spoke Russian and were part of the Soviet Union."
He said he hoped that Ms. Amelina's 10-year-old son would come of age in a free and independent Ukraine.
"That's what they are fighting for," he said. "I hope that they will not lose this war. Because if Ukraine loses, we all lose."

The Market Surge Comes to an End: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks fell Thursday, taking some air out of Wall Street's big recent rally, despite fatter-than-expected profit reports from big companies and the latest signals of a resilient economy.
The S&P 500 sank 0.6 percent after touching its highest level in nearly 16 months during the morning. The Dow Jones industrial average also flipped from an early gain to a loss and dropped 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5 percent.
Honeywell International was a heavy weight on the market despite reporting stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected. It dropped 5.7 percent after its revenue fell short of analysts' expectations, as did its forecast for earnings in the current quarter.
The dip for Wall Street put a halt to a torrid run where the Dow climbed for 13 straight days. It was up as many as 125 points Thursday morning and seemed to be on the verge of tying a win-streak record set in 1897, before it ran out of momentum.
Stocks have been roaring on hopes the Federal Reserve can pull off what earlier seemed like a long-shot bet: successfully pull down high inflation by raising interest rates without sending the economy into a painful recession.
But critics have been saying the market's sharp move upward has been too much, too fast and that the seemingly growing consensus about a "soft landing" for the economy is hardly a certainty.
"The move is very explainable, but I stop short of calling it justifiable because I think it's too early to go all in on the idea that the Fed can claim victory" over high inflation, said Bryant VanCronkhite, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.
"We still have to be humble about our ability to predict the long-term effects of what we're living through, including the rapid rise in interest rates and recovery from a pandemic that forced massive changes in the labor force and supply chains," he said.
Reports about the economy on Thursday were mostly encouraging, but Mr. VanCronkhite said they could also keep the pressure up on inflation.
Strong data on the job market in particular could mean U.S. households will keep spending, encouraging companies to keep raising prices.
That in turn could push the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher than expected, keeping alive the threat of a recession.
In the bond market, Treasury yields rallied after the wave of reports indicated the economy is in stronger shape than expected.
One estimate said growth for the overall economy accelerated in the spring. That easily topped forecasts from economists, who were expecting a slowdown from the first three months of the year.
That report also suggested a measure of inflation wasn't as high from April through June as expected.
Another report said fewer workers applied for jobless benefits last week. It's the latest indication the job market remains remarkably solid, while a third report said orders for long-lasting manufactured goods strengthened more than expected last month.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.01 percent from 3.85 percent late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.92 percent from 4.85 percent.
Thursday's drops for stocks came despite a stronger-than-expected profit report from Meta Platforms, one of Wall Street's most influential stocks.
The owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp attracted additional active members, and its stock rose 4.4 percent.
McDonald's rose 1.2 percent after it easily topped analysts' forecasts for profits during the spring and said its sales grew worldwide.

How Modelo Dethroned Bud Light: [Correction]

Author: Moreno, J Edward

Full text: A decade before Bud Light faced a conservative-led boycott over a transgender influencer, Modelo Especial was on track to take the No. 1 spot.
More beers in America are being paired with lime than ever before.
The story of how Modelo Especial, a Mexican lager, surpassed Bud Light as the top-selling beer in America predates the conservative backlash that Bud Light faced in April over a collaboration with a transgender influencer. The country's steadily growing Hispanic population is only part of the story, too.
Rather, the factors that, for the better part of a decade, put Modelo on its triumphant track include an increasing preference among American consumers for imported, more expensive beer; a decade-old antitrust deal; and effective marketing campaigns aimed at attracting young, non-Hispanic consumers to the Mexican beer.
"Most people in the beer industry have assumed Modelo was going to overtake Bud Light at some point," said Bart Watson, chief economist for the Brewers Association, a trade group representing over 6,000 American breweries. "It was a question of when, not if."
The switch occurred at the start of June, after Bud Light had held the No. 1 spot for about 20 years. In the four-week period that ended July 8, Modelo made up 8.7 percent of retail beer sales in the United States, compared with Bud Light's 6.8 percent, according to Nielsen IQ data analyzed by the consulting firm Bump Williams.
Bud Light's ouster followed a conservative-led boycott that was set off when Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer, posted a video on Instagram on April 1 promoting a Bud Light contest. The company has since dismissed two marketing executives and has reported plunging sales.
In an earnings call last month, Bill Newlands, the chief executive of Constellation Brands, which owns the rights to Modelo in the United States, told investors that the beer's rise to the top had happened "sooner than we anticipated." Constellation's beer business reported an 11 percent sales increase and a 7.5 percent increase in shipments for the quarter that ended May 31.
Constellation, which also owns the U.S. rights to the Mexican beers Corona and Pacifico, is perhaps the biggest winner in the American beer market, as consumer tastes in alcohol have shifted over the past decade.
Americans are drinking less beer than they used to, and the beer that they've grown to prefer is more expensive than Bud Light, Mr. Watson noted. Craft beers and imports, like Modelo, as well as hard seltzers and canned cocktails, have benefited from that shift at the expense of domestic brands, he added.
Younger drinkers tend to want something new or different, and usually more expensive, than the previous generation, said Nadine Sarwat, an alcoholic-beverage analyst at Bernstein Autonomous, a market research company. That trend has been going on for generations: When lighter beers like Bud Light began having their moment in the 1980s and 1990s, they, too, were more expensive than competitors.
"You don't like to drink what your parents drink," Ms. Sarwat said.
A demographic shift has also contributed to Modelo's success. Hispanic people made up 19 percent of the U.S. population in 2021, up from 13 percent in 2000, according to the Census Bureau.
Along with that, Mexican products have gained "cultural appeal" among non-Hispanic consumers, Ms. Sarwat said. And it's not just beer: The volume of tequila and mezcal -- Mexican liquors -- sold in the United States increased 273 percent from 2003 to 2022, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.
Mexico exports more beer to the United States than any other country by far. In 2022, it shipped in seven times the volume of the second-highest source of U.S. beer imports, the Netherlands.
From 2013 to 2022, the amount of Mexican beer imports doubled, according to data from the Beer Institute. Mexico carried the overall growth in U.S. beer imports during that time: Imports from everywhere else dropped more than 25 percent.
The biggest growth in Mexican beer sales over the past year has been in states closer to the Canadian border, which tend to have lower Hispanic populations, while growth in states closer to Mexico has lagged, according to one Nielsen IQ analysis of on-premise sales.
Modelo, however, has enjoyed greater success than other Mexican beers that sell in the United States, including Tecate and Dos Equis.
"That is proof that just having a Mexican beer brand isn't enough," Ms. Sarwat said.
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of Bud Light, began to see the writing on the wall a decade ago.
In 2012, the company sought to acquire Grupo Modelo, which brews Modelo and Corona. The Department of Justice under President Barack Obama sued to block that deal in early 2013, arguing that keeping Modelo beers independent from Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, the two major American beer companies, was critical to maintaining a fair market.
Bill Baer, who led the agency's antitrust division at the time, said Anheuser-Busch had sought the deal because it had been worried about Modelo's rise. The parties reached a settlement in 2013, allowing the acquisition to go through as long as another company, which turned out to be Constellation, controlled Grupo Modelo's U.S. operations.
"The result in the market was Constellation had every incentive as an independent owner to really promote the hell out of Corona and the other Modelo brands," said Mr. Baer, now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. "And that's exactly what has happened."
Asked for comment, an Anheuser-Busch spokesperson pointed to the fact that Bud Light sold more beer by volume in the United States than Modelo, which owes its sales lead in part to its higher price point.
In the decade since Constellation has owned the U.S. rights to Modelo, it has worked meticulously to refine the beer's identity.
Promoting Modelo has been a balancing act of maintaining its authenticity to its Hispanic base while inviting new consumers, said Jim Sabia, head of Constellation's beer division. In 2016, Modelo rolled out its first English-language advertising push, with a "fighting spirit" marketing campaign.
Since then, Constellation has sought to position Modelo as a game-day beer. In 2017, it became the sponsor of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a deal that it has renewed and that is in the "low eight figures" annually, according to Sports Business Journal. That identity is distinct from Modelo's sister brand, Corona, which Constellation has promoted as a beer to sip on the beach with friends.
"It takes a lot of time to truly find the essence of these brands," Mr. Sabia said, "and when we finally get it, we stick with it."

Bronny James Is in Stable Condition: What to Know About His Cardiac Arrest: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: James was hospitalized after a cardiac arrest during a practice at the University of Southern California. He was treated at a hospital and was in stable condition, his family said.
LeBron James Jr., the son of the Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James who is an incoming freshman at the University of Southern California, collapsed at practice on Monday after suffering a cardiac arrest. James Jr., who is known as Bronny, was hospitalized in the intensive care unit but later released from the I.C.U. and is in stable condition, according to a statement from a spokesman for LeBron James and his wife, Savannah.
Here's what to know:
What happened?
According to the statement from the family, Bronny James was practicing with the U.S.C. men's basketball team in Los Angeles when he suffered a cardiac arrest.
The Los Angeles Fire Department received a call for medical aid and responded at 9:26 a.m. to the university's Galen Center gymnasium. According to the James family's statement, medical staff treated Bronny James, and he was taken to the hospital.
"LeBron and Savannah wish to publicly send their deepest thanks and appreciation to the U.S.C. medical and athletic staff for their incredible work and dedication to the safety of their athletes," the statement read.
Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops and is different from a heart attack, in which blood flow to the heart is blocked. The survival rate for cardiac arrest when treated with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation is about 11 percent, but the rate rises to about 41 percent if victims receive immediate defibrillation. It's unclear what kind of treatment Bronny James received.
Another U.S.C. player, Vincent Iwuchukwu, similarly suffered a cardiac arrest during practice last summer, when he was also an incoming freshman. According to the Los Angeles Times, Iwuchukwu was revived using a defibrillator and was hospitalized. He returned to play 14 games for the team last season.
Who is Bronny James?
Bronny James, 18, is the oldest of LeBron James's three children. He was a four-star recruit out of Sierra Canyon, and announced his commitment to U.S.C. in an Instagram post in May. James is a 6-foot-3 guard, deemed one of the top point guards among recruits and ranked No. 19 as a prospect in high school.
James would be eligible to enter the N.B.A. draft after one year at U.S.C. LeBron James, 38, has stated his desire to play with Bronny in the N.B.A.
What happens next?
The U.S.C. men's basketball team was set to take a 10-day trip to Greece and Croatia starting Aug. 5 to play three games against professional teams, according to a statement from the school. It was unclear if those plans would change in the wake of James's hospitalization.
It is also unclear when James might be released from the hospital.
What has the reaction been?
James's collapse and hospitalization was reminiscent of the collapse of the Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin on the field during a game in January.
"Prayers to Bronny and the James family as well," Hamlin posted Tuesday. "Here for you guys just like you have been for me my entire process."
Magic Johnson, another Lakers great, said he was praying for Bronny James and "hoping he makes a full and speedy recovery."

Internet Censorship By Russia Has Soared 30-Fold During War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A report from Citizen Lab laid out how much online censorship has increased on one of Russia's biggest social media sites.
What's the difference between Russia's internet before and after the invasion of Ukraine? The answer: a thirtyfold increase in censorship.
That was the finding of a report published on Wednesday by Citizen Lab, a group from the University of Toronto that studies online censorship in authoritarian countries. The new report was one of the first attempts to quantify the extent of Russian internet censorship since the war began in February 2022.
To compile its findings, Citizen Lab analyzed more than 300 court orders from the Russian government against Vkontakte, one of the country's largest social media sites, demanding that it remove accounts, posts, videos and other content. Before the war, Russia's government issued internet takedown orders to Vkontakte, known as VK, once every 50 days on average. After the conflict began, that number jumped to nearly once a day, according to Citizen Lab.
Often the court orders focused on getting VK to remove news from independent media sites, as well as posts and accounts that expressed opposition to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin or the war. The government also used keyword blocking to censor lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer terms on the site, the report said.
"These findings suggest the extreme political sensitivity of the Ukraine war in Russia and in Russia's need to tightly control Russians' access to information regarding the invasion," said Jeffrey Knockel, one of the report's authors.
The limits on VK are a part of a wider effort by Russian authorities to use technology to shape public opinion and crack down on dissent. That campaign also includes a wider internet censorship system, a propaganda blitz and the deployment of digital surveillance tools to track people's mobile phones and online activities.
Since the war began, Russia has also blocked access to some international sites, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. To get around the bans, many in Russia have taken to using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which are tools that circumvent those controls.
Despite Mr. Putin's determination to limit what can be said online, Russia's bureaucracy has not had great success in responding to real-time events. When Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary Wagner Group, turned against the Kremlin last month, Russia's censors blocked some content related to the mutiny -- like Mr. Prigozhin's name and that of the Wagner Group -- but proved ineffective at stopping widespread discussion and even media articles about what had transpired.
Platforms like Telegram and YouTube remain available in Russia and are widely used sources of information.
In the report, Citizen Lab researchers also compared content on VK that was available in Canada, where the site is less restricted, against what was not viewable to internet users in Russia. Citizen Lab found evidence of personal accounts, videos and community groups blocked from Russian users, much of it related to the war.
Russia's online content purges are small compared with those in other authoritarian countries such as China and Iran. Yet the techniques the countries use are similar.
The primary way Russian censors cut content on VK was by blocking community and personal accounts on the site. But Russian authorities also employed other techniques that are common in China, including measures to prevent users from searching for specific words on the site.

Bronny James, the Superstar's 18-Year-Old Son, Is Stable After Cardiac Arrest: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bronny, a basketball recruit at the University of Southern California, was stricken during a practice on Monday. He is out of intensive care and in stable condition, his family said.
LeBron James Jr., the son of the N.B.A. star LeBron James, suffered a cardiac arrest while practicing at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles on Monday and was taken to the hospital for treatment in the intensive care unit, according to a statement from a spokesman for LeBron James and his wife, Savannah. The younger James, known as Bronny, is now in stable condition and no longer in the I.C.U., the statement said.
"LeBron and Savannah wish to publicly send their deepest thanks and appreciation to the U.S.C. medical and athletic staff for their incredible work and dedication to the safety of their athletes," the statement said.
The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call for medical aid at 9:26 a.m. in the 3400 block of Figueroa Street in Los Angeles, the address of the university's Galen Center athletic facility, a department spokeswoman said on Tuesday. The department would not disclose who needed medical aid, citing federal policy.
Bronny James, 18, will be a freshman at U.S.C. this fall. He is the eldest of the Lakers star LeBron James's three children. Bronny James was a four-star recruit and chose U.S.C. over Oregon and Ohio State.
The U.S.C. men's basketball program was scheduled to take a 10-day exhibition trip to Greece and Croatia beginning Aug. 5, according to a statement it released in May. It was not clear whether the team would still make the trip or whether James would go.
Cardiac arrest, when the heart stops, is different from a heart attack, which happens when blood flow in an artery feeding the heart is blocked. More than 300,000 people a year experience cardiac arrest outside of hospitals.
The survival rate for those who suffer cardiac arrest and receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation is just 11.2 percent. For those who receive immediate defibrillation, survival rises to 41 percent. It was not known what treatment James received.
Brain damage is likely if a person in cardiac arrest goes four to six minutes without CPR, and brain death occurs after 10 minutes. Only 8 percent of cardiac arrest survivors emerge with a good neurological outcome. Most "have some degree of brain injury," Monica Sales, a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, said in an interview in January.
U.S.C. has experience handling cardiac emergencies. During a workout at the Galen Center last summer, the incoming freshman Vincent Iwuchukwu suffered a cardiac arrest and was hospitalized. Iwuchukwu returned to play in 14 games for the Trojans last season.
Keyontae Johnson, a budding star at Florida, went into cardiac arrest during a game in 2020. He eventually recovered and resumed his career at Kansas State, where he starred last season on a team that reached the round of 8 in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Johnson was selected by Oklahoma City in the second round of the N.B.A. draft in June.
Few cardiac events have played out more publicly than Damar Hamlin's collapse from cardiac arrest during a nationally televised football game last season. Hamlin, who is now attempting to resume his career with the Buffalo Bills, posted a message of support for James on Twitter: "Prayers to Bronny & The James family as well. here for you guys just like you have been for me my entire process."
Montrice Wright, the mother of Kijani Wright, a freshman forward with the Trojans, said that she had not spoken with her son since James's collapse, but that she hoped that he and the other members of the team were coping in the wake of the second such incident in just over a year.
"The concern doesn't go away when you witness something like that," she said. "These kids put themselves through so much; they don't rest enough, and it's been hot."
Researchers at the University of Washington have conducted an exhaustive analysis of cardiac deaths in N.C.A.A. sports. Dr. Kimberly Harmon, the lead author who is affiliated with Washington's Center for Sports Cardiology, said that Black male college basketball players have a higher risk of sudden cardiac death than other groups of players.
The annual risk of sudden cardiac death in Black Division I basketball players is one in 5,000. In white players, it is one in 16,000. Dr. Harmon said she and her colleagues had not found an explanation for the discrepancy.
"We see it again and again, not only in N.C.A.A. players, but also in high school athletes," she said.
James is not the only son of an N.B.A. star who has experienced heart issues. Shareef O'Neal, one of Shaquille O'Neal's sons and a friend of James, had open-heart surgery in 2018 when he was 18 after being diagnosed with a congenital heart defect that affected the coronary artery.
Since then, O'Neal has documented his recovery on social media as he has worked to return to playing basketball. O'Neal had to learn how to walk again, and he spent several months in rehabilitation, according to the American Heart Association.
In an interview on the "Now For Later" podcast this week, O'Neal said that "in 20 years, I just want to be known as that kid who fought back from something that was life-changing and made his dreams come true.
"I honestly thought I wasn't going to play basketball ever again," O'Neal said.
Basketball is often an afterthought on the U.S.C. campus, where football reigns supreme. But that was expected to change this season, in part because of the presence of the younger James, who has 7.5 million followers on Instagram, and who would be playing home games within walking distance of the arena where his father stars for the Lakers.
Crowds were expected to follow James, just as they had since the summer before he entered high school, when fans were turned away at the door of a gym at a premier high school recruiting showcase to watch him play against others in his age group.
As he grew and his game developed, James came to be viewed by college coaches as a complementary player with a high basketball I.Q. -- a guard who was viewed as a contributor but not a star on a team with Final Four ambitions.
His recruitment, though, largely played out as "don't call us, we'll call you" -- and he eventually took visits, though not to basketball powers like Duke and Kentucky. Instead, he toured schools where he might play more readily: Oregon, whose benefactor is Phil Knight, a founder of Nike, the shoe company that has a strong relationship with the elder James; Ohio State, the school LeBron said he would have attended if he had been required to go to college before going to the N.B.A.; and his close-to-home school, U.S.C.
The Trojans will also have D.J. Rodman, a transfer from Washington State, whose basketball-playing father, Dennis, was a pop culture sensation in the 1990s. But it is more than a team of scions of basketball stars.
U.S.C. should be quite good after adding one of the top freshmen in the country, Isaiah Collier, a point guard from Marietta, Ga. He will team with Boogie Ellis, the Pac-12's second-leading returning scorer; center Joshua Morgan, who led the conference in blocks last season; and forward Kobe Johnson, who is the conference's leading returner in steals.
Iwuchukwu, a 7-foot-1 center, is also considered an N.B.A. prospect.
After this season, Bronny James would be eligible for the N.B.A. draft. LeBron James has often said he would like to play on an N.B.A. team with his son, and he has even hinted that he wants to play with his younger son, Bryce, 16, who attends Campbell Hall School in Los Angeles. LeBron and Savannah James's daughter, Zhuri, is 8.
LeBron James, 38, led the Lakers to the Western Conference finals last season, which was his 20th in the N.B.A. In February he became the N.B.A.'s all-time leading scorer, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had held the title for nearly 39 years.

Predictably, Summer's New Political Flashpoint Is Wrapped in Pink: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Political figures of all types grabbed for the legs of a doll-turned-movie-turned-cultural moment, with predictable results.
Last week, Representative Matt Gaetz and his wife, Ginger, arrived at a Washington reception for "Barbie" in matching pink, grinning in photos along the "pink carpet," mingling among guests sipping pink cocktails, admiring a life-size pink toy box.
They left with political ammunition.
"The Barbie I grew up with was a representation of limitless possibilities, embracing diverse careers and feminine empowerment," Mrs. Gaetz wrote on Twitter. "The 2023 Barbie movie, unfortunately, neglects to address any notion of faith or family, and tries to normalize the idea that men and women can't collaborate positively (yuck)."
When another account scolded Mr. Gaetz, the hard-right and perpetually stunt-seeking Florida congressman, for attending the event at all -- citing the casting of a trans actor as a doctor Barbie -- Mr. Gaetz replied with a culture-warring double feature.
"If you let the trans stop you from seeing Margo Robbie," he said, leaving the "T" off the first name of the film's star, "the terrorists win."
The non-terroristic winners were many after the film's estimated $ 155 million debut: Ms. Robbie and Greta Gerwig, the film's director, finding an eager audience for their pink-hued feminist opus; the Warner Bros. marketing team, whose ubiquitous campaigns plainly paid off; the film industry itself, riding "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" to its most culturally dominant weekend in years.
But few outcomes were as nominally inexplicable (and probably inevitable) as the film's instant utility to political actors and opportunists of all kinds. For a modern take on what was long a politically fraught emblem of toxic body image and reductive social norms, no choice was too small, no turn too ideology-affirming or apparently nefarious, for a bipartisan coalition of commentators and elected officials to see value in its dissection.
"I have, like, pages and pages of notes," Ben Shapiro, the popular conservative commentator, said in a lengthy video review, which began with him setting a doll aflame and did not grow more charitable. (He said his producers "dragged" him to the theater.)
"I took a tequila shot every time Barbie said patriarchy ... only just woke up," wrote Elon Musk. (Mr. Shapiro, diligently but less colorfully, said he had counted the word "more than 10 times.")
"Here are 4 ways Barbie embraces California values," the office of Gavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, wrote in a thread hailing Barbie as a champion of climate activism, "hitting the roads in her electric vehicle," and of destigmatizing mental health care.
If there was a time in the culture when a giant summer film event was something of an American unifier -- a moment to share over-buttered popcorn through big-budget shoot-'em-ups and sagas of insatiable sharks -- that time is not 2023.
And, as ever, the political class's performative investment in "Barbie" -- the outrage and the embrace -- can seem mostly like a winking bit.
What to make of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat of Michigan, posting a Barbie meant to resemble herself beside the Instagram caption, "Come on Barbie, let's go govern"?
What does it mean, exactly, when Senator Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia, says of himself, "This Ken is pushing to end maternal mortality"?
Certainly, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has summoned practiced gravity in accusing "Barbie" of working to appease the Chinese. (Some Republicans have fixated on a scene that features a crudely drawn map that supposedly depicts the so-called nine-dash line, which indicates Chinese ownership of oceanic territory that is disputed under international law. Vietnam has banned showings of the movie in the country over that image.)
"Obviously, the little girls that are going to see Barbie, none of them are going to have any idea what those dashes mean," Mr. Cruz told Fox News. "This is really designed for the eyes of the Chinese censors, and they're trying to kiss up to the Chinese Communist Party because they want to make money selling the movie."
The response on the right is not a one-off. For a generation of conservative personalities, weaned on Andrew Breitbart's much-cited observation that "politics is downstream of culture," Hollywood and other ostensibly liberal bastions are to be confronted head-on, lest their leanings ensnare young voters without a fight.
Recent years have provided ample evidence, some on the right say, for a "go woke, go broke" view that progressivism is bad business. Last year's apolitically patriotic "Top Gun: Maverick" was a smashing success, as was this year's kid-friendly "The Super Mario Bros. Movie." By contrast, critics on the right contended that Disney's remake of "The Little Mermaid," with its title character portrayed by the Black actress Halle Bailey, failed to match its producers' hopes. (Of course, there is no way to trace exactly what determines any movie's success or failure, and many observers adhere to the screenwriter William Goldman's axiom: "Nobody knows anything.")
"Barbie" cannot be said to have gone broke. But its purported politics, conservatives have argued, did damage it by making it less entertaining -- "a lecture," in the words of The Federalist's Rich Cromwell, "that self-identifies as a movie."
Kyle Smith, a reviewer at The Wall Street Journal, complained that the film "contains more swipes at 'the patriarchy' than a year's worth of Ms. magazine."
The film seems at times (gentle spoiler alert) to be engaging with "the patriarchy" ironically, infusing it with knowing Southern California vapidity, décor that seems inspired by hair metal and a heavy emphasis on weight lifting and "brewskis."
When it comes time (less gentle spoiler alert) to reclaim Barbie Land, the Barbies distract the Kens by indulging their tendency for exaggerated gestures of malehood like playing acoustic guitar and insisting on showing a date "The Godfather" while talking over it.
Mr. Shapiro has sounded unconvinced that the movie is broadly in on its own jokes.
"The actual argument the movie is making is that if women enjoy men, it's because they have been brainwashed by the patriarchy," he said in his review.
He called the film, with a straight face, two hours he will rue wasting as he sits on his deathbed.
"The things I do," he said, "for my audience."

Full text: The climate activist said that trials like hers brought attention to climate change and that she would continue to protest.
A court in Sweden fined the climate activist Greta Thunberg on Monday on charges of disobeying police orders while blocking traffic last month during a protest in the port of the city of Malmo.
"Why is it us -- who are taking action in line with the science to stop the fossil industry -- who face legal consequences, when the fossil industry continues to destroy the chance for people to live safe and worthy lives?" Ms. Thunberg, 20, who is perhaps the world's most prominent climate activist, said to reporters outside the court on Monday.
The decision came as much of Southern Europe is in the grip of scorching heat waves, which have become more frequent and intense because of climate change.
Emma Ohlsson, the public prosecutor on the case, said that last month, Ms. Thunberg sat with a group of climate protesters at the port blocking vehicles coming in and out. An officer initially allowed them to sit there to give them the opportunity to express their opinions, she said, but about a half-hour later the police asked them to move.
Some protesters moved, Ms. Ohlsson added, but others, including Ms. Thunberg, did not. The police had to physically remove Ms. Thunberg from the street.
Ms. Ohlsson added that Ms. Thunberg told the court that she heard and understood the order but that she chose not to obey it.
"We choose to not be bystanders, and instead physically stop the fossil fuel infrastructure," Ms. Thunberg wrote on Instagram at the time. "We are reclaiming the future."
In court, Ms. Thunberg was allowed to ask questions to a police officer involved in the episode, according to local media reports, and she asked how he thought an individual could best slow down the climate crisis.
The officer said that it was a good question, according to the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan, and that he did not have a good answer.
Ms. Thunberg's penalty amounted to 30 fines of 50 Swedish krona, for a total of about $ 150, plus about 1,000 krona, or about $ 100, that she must pay to a fund for crime victims. Ms. Ohlsson, the prosecutor, said that the fine was very low because Ms. Thunberg committed a minor violation. Ms. Thunberg also told the court that she did not have any income at the moment, the prosecutor noted.
The fine comes as climate protesters around the world have blocked highways, and also occupied galleries and targeted works of art, sometimes at a high cost for both the protesters and the institutions involved.
Ms. Thunberg told reporters outside the courtroom that the fine was expected, but that trials like hers can help the cause by bringing attention to it.
"We will continue as long as the situation is as it is," she said. "It's only getting worse," she added. "We will not back down."
True to her word, after the hearing, Ms. Thunberg participated in another climate protest in Malmo. Again, she refused to move when asked to do so, and she was carried away by the police.

Tech Firms Once Powered New York’s Economy. Now They’re Scaling Back.

NEW YORK — For much of the last two decades, including during the pandemic, technology companies were a bright spot in New York’s economy, adding thousands of high-paying jobs and expanding into millions of square feet of office space.
Their growth buoyed tax revenue, set up New York as a credible rival to the San Francisco Bay Area — and provided jobs that helped the city absorb layoffs in other sectors during the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis.
Now, the technology industry is pulling back hard, clouding the city’s economic future.
Facing many business challenges, large technology companies have laid off more than 386,000 workers worldwide since early 2022, according to the website layoffs.fyi, which tracks the tech industry. And they have pulled out of millions of square feet of office space because of those job cuts and the shift to working from home.
That retrenchment has hurt lots of tech hubs, and San Francisco has been hit the hardest with an office vacancy rate of 25.6%, according to Newmark Research.
New York is doing better than San Francisco — Manhattan has a vacancy rate of 13.5% — but it can no longer count on the technology industry for growth. More than one-third of the roughly 22 million square feet of office space available for sublet in Manhattan comes from technology, advertising and media companies, according to Newmark.
Consider Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. It is now unloading a big chunk of the more than 2.2 million square feet of office space it gobbled up in Manhattan in recent years after laying off around 1,700 employees this year, or one-quarter of its New York state workforce. The company has opted not to renew leases covering 250,000 square feet in Hudson Yards and for 200,000 square feet on Park Avenue South.
Spotify is trying to sublet five of the 16 floors it leased six years ago in 4 World Trade Center, and Roku is offering one-quarter of the 240,000 square feet it had taken in Times Square just last year. Twitter, Microsoft and other technology companies are also trying to sublease unwanted space.
“The tech companies were such a big part of the real estate landscape during the last five years,” said Ruth Colp-Haber, CEO of Wharton Property Advisors, a real estate brokerage. “And now that they seem to be cutting back, the question is: Who is going to replace them?”
Colp-Haber said it could take months for bigger spaces or entire floors of buildings to be sublet. The large amount of space available for sublet is also driving down the rents that landlords are able to get on new leases.
“They are going to undercut every landlord out there in terms of pricing, and they have really nice spaces that are already all built out,” she said, referring to the tech companies.
The tech sector has been a driver of New York’s economy since the late ’90s dot-com boom helped to establish “Silicon Alley” south of midtown Manhattan. Then, after the financial crisis, the expansion of companies like Google supported the economy when banks, insurers and other financial firms were in retreat.
Small and large tech companies added 43,430 jobs in New York in the five years through the end of 2021, a 33% gain, according to the state comptroller. And those jobs paid very well: The average tech salary in 2021 was $228,620, nearly double the average private-sector salary in the city, according to the comptroller.
The growth in jobs fueled demand for commercial space, and tech, advertising and media companies accounted for nearly one-quarter of the new office leases signed in Manhattan in recent years, according to Newmark.
Microsoft and Spotify declined to comment about their decision to sublet space. Twitter and Roku did not respond to requests for comment. Meta said in a statement that it was “committed to distributed work” and was “continuously refining” its approach.
A few Big Tech companies are still expanding in New York.
Google plans to open St. John’s Terminal, a large office near the Hudson River in lower Manhattan, early next year. Including the terminal, Google will own or lease around 7 million square feet of office space in New York, up from roughly 6 million today, according to a company representative. (Google leases more than 1 million square feet of that space to other tenants.) The company has more than 12,000 employees in the New York area, up from over 10,000 in 2019.
Amazon, which in 2019 canceled plans to build a large campus in Queens after local politicians objected to the incentives offered to the company, has nevertheless added 200,000 square feet of office space in New York and Jersey City and Newark in New Jersey since 2019. The company will have added roughly 550,000 square feet of office space later this summer, when it opens 424 Fifth Ave., the former Lord & Taylor department store, which it bought in 2020 for $1.15 billion.
“New York provides a fantastic, diverse talent pool, and we’re proud of the thousands of jobs we’ve created in the city and state over the past 10 years across both our corporate and operations functions,” Holly Sullivan, vice president of worldwide economic development at Amazon, said in a statement.
And though many tech companies continue to let employees work from home for much of the week, they are also trying to woo workers back to the office, which could help reduce the need to sublet space.
Salesforce, a software company that has offices in a tower next to Bryant Park, said it was not considering subletting its New York space.
“Currently I’m facing the opposite problem in the tower in New York,” said Relina Bulchandani, head of real estate for Salesforce. “There has been a concerted effort to continue to grow the right roles in New York because we have a very high customer base in New York.”
New York is and will remain a vibrant home for technology companies, industry representatives said.
“I have not heard of a single tech company leaving, and that matters,” said Julie Samuels, president of TECH:NYC, an industry association. “If anything, we are seeing less of a contraction in New York among tech leases than they are seeing in other large cities.”
Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, said tech executives now felt less of a need to be in Silicon Valley, a shift that he said had benefited New York. “We have more company CEOs and more company founders in New York today than we did before the pandemic,” Wilson said, referring to the companies his firm has invested in.
David Falk, president of the New York tri-state region for Newmark, said, “We are right now working on several transactions with smaller, young tech firms that are looking to take sublet space.”
Many firms are still pulling back, however.
In 2017 and 2019, Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, signed leases totaling more than 564,000 square feet of space at 4 World Trade Center, becoming one of the largest tenants there. It soon had a space with all the accouterments you would expect at a tech firm — brightly colored flexible work areas, eye-popping views and pingpong tables.
But in January, Spotify said it was laying off 600 people, or about 6% of its global workforce. The company, which allows employees to choose between working fully remotely or on a hybrid schedule, is also reducing its office space, putting five floors up for sublet.
“On days when I’m by myself, I end up sitting in a meeting room all day for focus time,” said Dayna Tran, a Spotify employee who regularly works at the downtown office, adding that the employees who come in motivate themselves and create community by collaborating on an office playlist.

As Drought Intensifies, Iran Bakes: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Water shortages from longtime mismanagement have left people with shrinking options, as temperatures spike and growing poverty makes air-conditioning unaffordable for many.
For a month and 10 days of unrelenting summer heat, Sepideh, a physician in southern Iran, and her dentist husband have left the house only for work (and only in the mornings) and for groceries (and only when the fridge is utterly bare). At one point last week, her car's dashboard thermometer read 57 degrees Celsius, about 135 degrees Fahrenheit.
She snapped a photo for Instagram. "Only 57 degrees!" she posted.
At least she had air-conditioning at home, a necessity not available to all. A combination of widening poverty and rising heat is crushing much of southern Iran, where sprawling desert, joined with the humidity of the nearby Persian Gulf, is especially prone to heat waves and droughts intensified by climate change.
Although the mercury was lower elsewhere in the country, the misery has still been great. Iranians have few ways to cope: The government's longstanding mishandling of water resources has made taps across the country run salty or dry, experts say, while Iran's stalled economy and double-digit inflation have deepened poverty that puts indoor jobs and air-conditioning out of reach for many.
Iran suffers from what Kaveh Madani, a United Nations water expert who formerly served as deputy head of Iran's environmental ministry, calls "water bankruptcy," in which, he said, misguided policies promoting agriculture and development have led water consumption to outstrip supply for so long that there is no way to reverse the depletion.
As groundwater and reservoirs dry up, droughts intensify and climate change pushes temperatures higher. Iranians in rural areas are increasingly unable to afford the trucked-in or store-bought water on which they must rely. Water shortages fueled protests in the historic city of Isfahan and in Khuzestan Province in 2021, and more discontent with the government is brewing over its failure to address the blistering heat.
"The government does nothing: no services, no advice, no special care," said Zahra, 32, an artist in the southern coastal city of Bandar-e Dayyer, where the taps have spouted salty, undrinkable water this summer. "We have to take care of ourselves," added Zahra, who, like other Iranians interviewed for this article, asked to be identified by only her first name to avoid trouble with the authorities.
Among those who lack running water are patients Sepideh has seen this summer in the villages around Masjed Soleyman, her home city in western Iran. Villagers have been forced to turn to wells that she said were choked with dead rats, lizards and cockroaches.
"All I see around me is misery and poverty," she said. "Wish I could say something hopeful. This is the reality, though."
Government officials have said that the poor, rural southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchistan -- where last month a member of Parliament said it was so hot that a streetlight in one city had melted -- will run out of municipal water entirely by September.
In Bandar Kangan, a southwestern city on the gulf coast, water used to be cut off on summer days from late afternoon until 5 or 6 a.m., said Azam, 39, a teacher who lives there. In the last few years, however, the taps have run for just a couple of hours each morning.
"We save water in our tanks and have learned how to use minimal water," he said. "Actually, there is no water at all to be wasted."
Adapting to the scorching heat and suffocating humidity is something that people across southern Iran learned to do long ago: going out only in the early morning or late at night, meeting friends next to rivers and canals.
They know that a couple of hours in such heat can mean headache, weakness, dizziness and a sunscreen-defying burn; that the humidity can make it feel as if they were inhaling steam with every breath; that even the water running from the taps during the day can scald; that plastic slippers left outside will deform in the sun; that sunglasses left in the car all day can melt.
Last Sunday, humidity and high temperatures merged for a heat index of 152 degrees Fahrenheit at Persian Gulf Airport on Iran's southern coast, a double-take-inducing heat that was past the limits of what humans can tolerate. In Bushehr, a coastal province that includes Bandar Kangan, schools and offices closed for a day this month in response to a forecast of 122 degrees and have limited their hours on other days.
But many workers have no choice but to endure the sun.
One video published on a Telegram channel called the Free Union of Iranian Workers showed a man in Asaluyeh, another city in Bushehr Province, who said that he had to work outdoors from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day.
"This is a worker's situation," he said. "We die a hundred times a day."
For those who can, the simplest adaptation is to hide out in the air-conditioning and hope to dodge the power cuts that plague southern Iran every summer.
The ancient Persians who lived on the land that is now Iran are believed to have pioneered the use of windcatchers, tall towers that trap cool breezes and funnel them down to cool buildings, thousands of years before electricity. Although windcatchers are now gaining currency among climate-conscious architects in other countries, air-conditioning won out long ago in Iran.
"We barely leave our houses," said Zahra, the artist. "So I cannot compare the heat with previous summers. All I can say is that it is boiling."

Lawsuits Ask If Big Tech Is to Blame For Massacre: [National Desk]

Full text: Two new lawsuits filed by the victims' families are the most recent attempt to hold social media companies responsible when men steeped in violent ideologies on those platforms open fire.
Ask the families of the victims of last year's racist massacre in Buffalo what they want and one goal comes up again and again.
"To hold anybody and everybody, in anything and everything, that had a part in what happened to my mother and the other nine, what was done in Buffalo, to hold them accountable," said Garnell W. Whitfield Jr., whose mother, Ruth, was one of 10 people -- all of them Black -- who were killed.
That longing for accountability has resulted in two new civil lawsuits filed by the Buffalo families, the most recent attempt to hold social media companies responsible when men steeped in violent ideologies on those platforms open fire. But even as such massacres continue, seemingly unabated, lawsuit after lawsuit against tech giants has thus far failed to award victims and their families in court.
Indeed, the Buffalo suits will face significant challenges, experts in digital law say, with some blunt predictions as to their likelihood for success.
"It's not going to work," said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University's law school and a co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.
In recent years, a handful of cases involving social media and tragic incidents have advanced past preliminary stages, including two lawsuits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks in Istanbul and Paris that reached the Supreme Court. But the nation's highest court rebuffed both efforts to hold companies, including Google and Twitter, liable for Islamic State videos appearing on their sites.
The primary legal obstacle, Mr. Goldman and others say, remains Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides protection to online companies from liability from third-party content published on their sites. Drafted in the incipient days of the internet, the statute was meant to protect internet companies from lawsuits over speech published in chat rooms or other forums.
But as the decades have passed, critics say, its scope has broadened, even as calls to narrow it have grown.
"The vast majority of courts have really indulged this very excessive, unqualified immunity approach to the reading of Section 230," said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who has advocated reforms to Section 230. "There hasn't been a case, I think, exactly like this one. But if you look at some of the other attempts to hold social media companies accountable for acts of terrorism, et cetera, they've mostly lost."
All of which galls people like Barbara Massey-Mapps, whose sister, Katherine, was also murdered in the Buffalo attack, during which the gunman used an assault rifle to shoot 13 customers and employees of a Tops supermarket. Three people survived.
The gunman, Payton Gendron, an avowed white supremacist, livestreamed his attack. He had written voluminous online diaries filled with racist content and references to so-called "replacement theory," which posits a nefarious conspiracy to replace white people with people of color.
And Ms. Massey-Mapps, 66, believes that social media is to blame for introducing him and others to such ideas, and for using algorithms that are capable of feeding a steady stream of videos to people seeking racist or other hateful content.
"This wouldn't spread as fast if you didn't have Facebook or YouTube or what have you," she said. "There's so much negativity, so much ugliness. And I'm like, Why?"
Ms. Massey-Mapps was among three victims' families and an employee of Tops who filed suit in May against social media companies, including Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and Google (which owns YouTube). A second suit was filed this month by a legal team led by Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney who said he intended to use the gunman's own admission that he was influenced by social media to prove the case and set a new precedent.
"The laws, the technical justifications, always exist until they don't exist anymore," Mr. Crump said, "Until people say, We can't condone this."
For opponents of Section 230, there have been glimmers of hope: In 2021, a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco -- Lemmon v. Snap -- limited the immunity provided by the law, in a case involving a so-called "speed filter" on Snapchat, which encouraged speeding in cars and had led to the deaths of three teenagers using the filter.
A recent case in Oregon -- against the anonymous chat site Omegle, which has been used by some sexual predators -- has also overcome Section 230 challenges. It is in the discovery phase and is headed to trial, the plaintiffs' attorneys said.
Like those cases, the suits filed in Buffalo argue that the social media platforms in question are essentially dangerous products, an effort to sidestep the content protections provided by Section 230. The two suits -- filed in state court in Erie County -- use nearly identical language, referring to the apps as "defective" and suggesting they were designed to be addictive to users and to encourage violence.
The Supreme Court, however, dealt blows to opponents of Section 230 in May, when it ruled against plaintiffs in the two suits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks seeking damages from Google and Twitter.
Jess Miers, legal advocacy counsel for Chamber of Progress, a lobbying group that represents tech firms such as Google and Meta, said that those Supreme Court decisions reinforced the protections provided by Section 230, while allowing websites leeway to crack down on hateful posts.
While "these tools and algorithms inadvertently amplify objectionable content," she added, the Section 230 protections are "crucial to ensure that social media companies can continue using algorithms" to monitor and minimize "harmful content."
José Castañeda, a spokesman for Google, said the company had "the deepest sympathies" for victims and families of the Tops shooting, and said that "YouTube has invested in technology, teams and policies to identify and remove extremist content."
Google also works with law enforcement and other platforms "to share intelligence and best practices," he added.
Jeff Kosseff, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval Academy's Cyber Science Department, said that the Buffalo suits could face additional challenges over free speech, as hate speech was constitutionally protected, with the exception of "true threat or imminent incitement of violence."
In recent years, there has been increased attention on the effects of social media on young people -- including a warning from the surgeon general in May. And Mr. Kosseff says such anti-tech sentiments could begin to suffuse legal arguments.
"We've had a lot of judges, particularly in cases against big tech companies, who are not very big fans of big tech companies," Mr. Kosseff said. "So that's why I would never say it's absolutely doomed."
Mr. Gendron, now 20, has already faced criminal charges: In February, he pleaded guilty in state court and was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. He also faces federal charges, including hate crimes, some of which could carry the death penalty.
At a news conference to announce the second lawsuit, family member after family member stepped up to the podium, some in tears, others stoic, to describe their pain.
"It doesn't turn off for me," said Kimberly Salter, whose husband, Aaron, a retired Buffalo police officer, was killed while working as a security guard at Tops and hailed as a hero afterward. "I'm sure it doesn't turn off for the other families either."

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Ask the families of the victims of last year’s racist massacre in Buffalo what they want and one goal comes up again and again.
“To hold anybody and everybody, in anything and everything, that had a part in what happened to my mother and the other nine, what was done in Buffalo, to hold them accountable,” said Garnell W. Whitfield Jr., whose mother, Ruth, was one of 10 people — all of them Black — who were killed.
That longing for accountability has resulted in two new lawsuits filed by the Buffalo families, the most recent attempt to hold social media companies responsible when men steeped in violent ideologies on those platforms open fire. But even as such massacres continue, seemingly unabated, lawsuit after lawsuit against tech giants has thus far failed to award victims and their families in court.
Indeed, the Buffalo suits will face significant challenges, experts in digital law say, with some blunt predictions as to their likelihood for success.
“It’s not going to work,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University’s law school and a co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.
In recent years, a handful of cases involving social media and tragic incidents have advanced past preliminary stages, including two lawsuits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks in Istanbul and Paris that reached the Supreme Court. But the nation’s highest court rebuffed both efforts to hold companies, including Google and Twitter, liable for Islamic State group videos appearing on their sites.
The primary legal obstacle, Goldman and others say, remains Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides protection to online companies from liability from third-party content published on their sites. Drafted in the incipient days of the internet, the statute was meant to protect internet companies from lawsuits over speech published in chat rooms or other forums.
But as the decades have passed, critics say, its scope has broadened, even as calls to narrow it have grown.
“The vast majority of courts have really indulged this very excessive, unqualified immunity approach to the reading of Section 230,” said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who has advocated reforms to Section 230. “There hasn’t been a case, I think, exactly like this one. But if you look at some of the other attempts to hold social media companies accountable for acts of terrorism, etc., they’ve mostly lost.”
All of which galls people such as Barbara Massey-Mapps, whose sister, Katherine, was murdered in the Buffalo attack, during which the assailant used an assault rifle to shoot 13 customers and employees of a Tops supermarket. Three people survived.
The shooter, Payton Gendron, an avowed white supremacist, livestreamed his attack. He had written voluminous online diaries filled with racist content and references to so-called “replacement theory,” which posits a nefarious conspiracy to replace white people with people of color.
And Massey-Mapps, 66, believes that social media is to blame for introducing him and others to such ideas, and for using algorithms that are capable of feeding a steady stream of videos to people seeking racist or other hateful content.
“This wouldn’t spread as fast if you didn’t have Facebook or YouTube or what have you,” she said. “There’s so much negativity, so much ugliness. And I’m like, why?”
Massey-Mapps was among three victims’ families and an employee of Tops who filed suit in May against social media companies, including Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and Google (which owns YouTube). A second suit was filed this month by a legal team led by Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney who said he intended to use the assailant’s own admission that he was influenced by social media to prove the case and set a precedent.
“The laws, the technical justifications, always exist until they don’t exist anymore,” Crump said, “until people say, ‘We can’t condone this.’ ”
For opponents of Section 230, there have been glimmers of hope: In 2021, a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco — Lemmon v. Snap — limited the immunity provided by the law, in a case involving a so-called “speed filter” on Snapchat, which encouraged speeding in cars and had led to the deaths of three teenagers using the filter.
A recent case in Oregon — against the anonymous chat site Omegle, which has been used by some sexual predators — has also overcome Section 230 challenges. It is in the discovery phase and is headed to trial, the plaintiffs’ attorneys said.
Like those cases, the suits filed in Buffalo argue that the social media platforms in question are essentially dangerous products, an effort to sidestep content protections provided by Section 230. The two suits — filed in state court in Erie County — use nearly identical language, referring to the apps as “defective” and suggesting they were designed to be addictive to users and to encourage violence.
The Supreme Court, however, dealt blows to opponents of Section 230 in May, when it ruled against plaintiffs in the two suits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks seeking damages from Google and Twitter.
Jess Miers, legal advocacy counsel for Chamber of Progress, a lobbying group that represents tech firms such as Google and Meta, said those Supreme Court decisions reinforced the protections provided by Section 230, while allowing websites leeway to crack down on hateful posts.
While “these tools and algorithms inadvertently amplify objectionable content,” she added, the Section 230 protections are “crucial to ensure that social media companies can continue using algorithms” to monitor and minimize “harmful content.”
José Castañeda, a spokesperson for Google, said the company had “the deepest sympathies” for victims and families of the Tops shooting, and said that “YouTube has invested in technology, teams and policies to identify and remove extremist content.”
Google also works with law enforcement and other platforms “to share intelligence and best practices,” he added.
Jeff Kosseff, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval Academy’s Cyber Science Department, said the Buffalo suits could face additional challenges over free speech, as hate speech was constitutionally protected, with the exception of “true threat or imminent incitement of violence .”
In recent years, there has been increased attention on the effects of social media on young people — including a warning from the surgeon general in May. And Kosseff says such anti-tech sentiments could begin to suffuse legal arguments.
“We’ve had a lot of judges, particularly in cases against Big Tech companies, who are not very big fans of Big Tech companies,” Kosseff said. “So that’s why I would never say it’s absolutely doomed.”
Gendron, now 20, has faced criminal charges: In February, he pleaded guilty in state court and was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. He also faces federal charges, including hate crimes, some of which could carry the death penalty.
At a news conference to announce the second lawsuit, family member after family member stepped up to the podium, some in tears, others stoic, to describe their pain.
“It doesn’t turn off for me,” said Kimberly Salter, whose husband, Aaron, a retired Buffalo police officer, was killed while working as a security guard at Tops and hailed as a hero afterward. “I’m sure it doesn’t turn off for the other families either.”

The Many Faces of John Mayer: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For some fans of Dead & Company, which just finished its Final Tour, the faces made by John Mayer while performing are almost as memorable as the music.
During the final show of Dead & Company's so-called Final Tour on Sunday night, the crowd at Oracle Park in San Francisco swayed and bobbed like the current of a turning river.
People in flower crowns grooved through the shimmying mass on the stadium's field. A man in cowboy regalia cupped his hands around his ears and two-stepped to the beat. A woman in face glitter who gave her name as Honey Bee regaled strangers with the tale of how she came with a man she had met two days before, who happened to have an extra ticket. Other fans, who were not as lucky, danced on the sidewalk outside of the park.
And onstage, the band's lead guitarist, John Mayer, leaned back, sucked his lips inside his mouth and scrunched his eyes closed as he wailed on a guitar while playing the song "Althea." Shortly after his impassioned solo, footage of it started spreading on Twitter.
Mr. Mayer has been a member of Dead & Company, an offshoot of the Grateful Dead, since it formed in 2015. Though he is not the band's face, the faces he has made while performing -- which can cover the full spectrum of human emotion, from despair to sweet relief to sublime pleasure -- have for some been almost as unforgettable as the music itself.
Fans have made YouTube compilations, photo collages, a meme with a giant slug and niche Instagram accounts dedicated to Mr. Mayer's expressive "guitar face," which is not exactly an anomaly in the world of rock 'n' roll. "I feel a little bit uncomfortable with people thinking that I made up the guitar face," he told Rolling Stone in 2017. "God, wouldn't it be great to go to the jungles of Borneo and give a tribe Fender Stratocasters and have them listen to Jimi Hendrix -- but not show them Jimi Hendrix -- and come back five years later and see if there's any guitar face? I have a feeling there would be."
Mr. Mayer, through a representative, declined to comment for this article. The faces he made during the last leg of the Final Tour appeared to reflect the mood of its tie-dye-wearing fans, which alternated between grief and ecstasy as the music that seemingly would never stop finally did. (Dead & Company members have said the tour would be its last, but have not ruled out the possibility of a future for the band.)
"The thing I love about him is he's fully enjoying it -- he's in the music," Tony Seigh, from Valparaiso, Ind., said of Mr. Mayer. "For those three, four hours, that guy is just in a different zone. And haters beware, he's going to be making some very strange faces."
Mr. Seigh, 33, runs Holy Moly Mischief, which sells Dead-themed T-shirts, fanny packs and a bumper sticker that reads: "KEEP HONKING! I'm on my way to see JOHN MAYER and what's left of the GRATEFUL DEAD." Mr. Seigh, who used to work for Tesla, said he had seen Dead & Company 86 times, and he described Mr. Mayer's faces using a word many others did: orgasmic.
"It's like a close-up of his face in an adult film," he said. "There are moments where it's like, Oh my gosh, something is happening to him. Like, is a ghost ... massaging him?"
Mr. Seigh, who was wearing a yellow "Always Grateful" hat that matched his yellow-painted toenails, added that Mr. Mayer's expressions were one of many visual elements of live performances by Dead & Company, whose members have included Bob Weir, Oteil Burbridge, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Jeff Chimenti and Jay Lane.
"Bob looks like a gray werewolf, and Oteil has, like, pro-wrestler face paint on, and Mickey looks like ET playing some drum thing," he said. "And then you look at John, and he looks like pictures of old Catholic saints when they're getting visited by an angel."
Clif Edwards, 60, a graphic designer from Sacramento whose hair was styled into a long gray ponytail, said that as a guitarist himself, he knew how playing could be a full-body experience. Of Mr. Mayer's facial expressions, he said, "I approve."
"But it's odd to watch," added Mr. Edwards, who said he had seen the original Grateful Dead play some 340 times.
A man in a tie-dye bucket hat who was standing near Mr. Edwards chimed in: "You know you're in the thick of the jam when he's got the face going."
Susan Marston, 58, a program manager from Boise, Idaho, said that unlike some longtime Dead fans who were skeptical when Mr. Mayer joined Dead & Company, she knew from the very beginning that he would bring something unique to the spinoff band.
"There's a lot of crusty people who said, 'Oh, I can't see John Mayer,"' Ms. Marston said. "But if you knew anything about John Mayer prior to joining Dead & Company, then you knew the guy could freaking rip the blues."
"Sometimes his eyes are rolling back in his head," added Ms. Marston, who was wearing a black top covered with photos of Mr. Mayer. "It elevates everybody because he's so into what we're into -- it's our synchronization with the band." As she spoke, a man with a fake scarlet begonia tucked into his hat interrupted her to show off a sticker that featured Mr. Mayer's face flashing a particularly euphoric expression and surrounded by a highly suggestive lyric from the song "The Weight."
A few Dead & Company fans said they had never noticed Mr. Mayer's expressions. Kim Holzem, 52, from Three Rivers, Calif., scoffed in disbelief when her husband, Tim, mentioned that he had never registered the guitarist's faces before.
"Sometimes he looks like he's in pain, other times he looks like he's blissed out," said Ms. Holzem, who saw Dead & Company three times last weekend in San Francisco with her husband and two teenage sons.
Mr. Mayer, she added, "makes some weird-ass faces, but he's still adorable."
Skyler McKinley, 31, a bar owner from Denver who was standing not far from the stage at the last show of the tour, said Mr. Mayer's face was "inescapable" at live performances, in part because it is often "blown up, to skyscraper size" on massive screens. He added that Mr. Mayer had the "sex energy of a rock star" while performing, and compared his facial expressions to the dance moves of Mick Jagger.
"At first I thought it was absurd, these lewd faces," Mr. McKinley said. "But this is his aspect of communing with Grateful Dead music, the same way we all do, in a religious sense."
"I have no idea what my face looks like when I'm at one of these shows," he added, "but I bet I look pretty ridiculous, too."
Photograph While preforming with Dead & Company on the band's Final Tour, John Mayer's various "guitar faces" have been described by fans as pained, ecstatic and even orgasmic.

Full text: A fan finds herself in a backstage hug, decades after she kissed her poster of the onetime teen idol.
I was approaching the George Washington Bridge when my friend Lynn fired a text into the Shaun Squad group chat: "GET READY, PARTY PEOPLE!"
My heart sank as the message piped through the car speakers in a robotic female voice.
I dictated back: "OMG, Lynn, you better not be about to text something that's going make me regret that I didn't get my brows waxed for tonight."
"I am," she replied.
A flood of adrenaline sent my pulse racing.
An hour later, I would be face to face with my original schoolgirl crush, Shaun Cassidy. Unruly eyebrows and all.
In the late '70s, thanks to the one-two punch of his starring role in ABC's teen detective series "The Hardy Boys" and a run of hit singles, he was regularly on the cover of Tiger Beat and other teen magazines. His look -- feathered hair, satin baseball jackets and skintight pants -- launched a tsunami of adolescent hormones.
Long before "nepo baby" was a thing, he rose to fame as the firstborn son of the musical star turned "Partridge Family" matriarch Shirley Jones and the Broadway legend Jack Cassidy. His half brother, David Cassidy, had preceded him in teen dream stature.
Shaun's most popular single was his cover of the Crystals' "Da Do Ron Ron," but my favorite was "That's Rock 'n' Roll," a solid bop written by Eric Carmen. Centered on a narrator who's 16 and sick of school, the lyrics preach the gospel of rock rebellion, and even in my grade school years, the song stuck.
Each of his albums came with a poster -- the record label knew its market -- and my friend Kristin and I pretended to kiss him until we dissolved into giggles.
As I marched into teendom, I moved from roller skates to combat boots, and my crushes took a more androgynous turn. MTV introduced a slew of British sad boys with teased hair and makeup, the most famous on American shores being Depeche Mode and the Cure. Their subtly subversive masculinity so besotted me that my real-life male contemporaries were a letdown. A memoir of my romantic coming-of-age could be titled "I Was Told There Would Be Eyeliner."
Then I saw Catherine Deneuve as the nightclubbing vampiress Miriam Blaylock in "The Hunger." Kissing Shaun's poster gave way to kissing a shy Goth girl under the poster for the film on her bedroom wall. But you never forget your first, and Shaun, with his faunlike visage, was the perfect gateway crush.
I fell for him the second time because of the rats.
Two years ago, one of his tweets appeared in my timeline. It showed a screen grab of a text from his wife asking him to talk with her about their "rat problem." Shaun gave it a caption: "She is such a romantic."
Former teen idol turned Wife Guy? Sure, I'd follow that. Four of my friends also started following him on Twitter, and the Shaun Squad was born.
So when the New York engagement of his "Magic of a Midnight Sky" solo show was announced, one Squad member, Joy, bought tickets the minute they went on sale, and Lynn contacted his tour manager, vowing to arrange a meet-and-greet.
Not likely, I thought. But the girl in me held fast to the fantasy.
As the club filled on the night of the show, our hopes for a meeting began to fade. Monica had a fresh keratin treatment, her hair a glossy curtain. Marjorie had found some old iron-on transfer paper and whipped up her own Shaun tank top. She even made us Swiftie-style "Shaun Squad" friendship bracelets. We were sighing dejectedly into our $ 18 cocktails when the tour manager appeared.
"OK, let's go," she said. "But we've got to be quick."
We moved past the audience of women clutching vintage Shaun memorabilia. I noticed that one of them had brought her "Hardy Boys" lunch box.
Up an elevator and down a narrow hall to the dressing room. And there he was -- tall, his hair a mix of blond and gray, the shiny disco-era outfit traded for a black button-down and jeans.
Shaun Freakin' Cassidy, OK?
I'm enough of an extrovert that I will go into a convenience store to buy chips and, five minutes later, end up saying, "What's your Instagram?" to the clerk. But not now.
Not now at all.
I let my fellow Shaun Squad members go first, watching them angle in for photos and autographs while he chatted with them, the basso profundo of his speaking voice a pleasing rumble.
Then there was nothing to do but move forward. I was like: "Why is he opening his arms? What is happening? Are we hugging? We are hugging!"
It wasn't a crazy hug -- a quick companionable embrace, followed by that 1-2-3 closure pat -- but it produced enough dopamine to make me unable to feel my face for the rest of the night.
The show, even without a fan's forgiving grading curve, was excellent, a mix of song and story. Given the heedlessness of 1970s celebrity culture, it's a wonder that Shaun was able to survive the reverse panopticon of teen stardom.
Tactful but candid, he talked about female fans tearing out chunks of his hair and his dad joking about putting his childhood bedroom up for rent when it seemed his son's fame might eclipse his own. He also included a touching tribute to David, who died of liver failure at age 67 in 2017.
Shaun made it clear that he wasn't coasting on the fumes of his former glory, having segued from teen idol to television writer and producer. Yet he seemed comfortable enough with his cultural footprint that, in his side hustle as a vintner, his wine is branded My First Crush.
Writing about a fangirl crush can make you feel like a goober, because it elicits contempt that is explicitly gendered. Female fandom -- especially Top 40 fandom -- carries a processed-cheese sheen. But a guy going on for an hour about a Bruce Springsteen chord progression or a Wilco set list? That's depth, man. (And queer fandom? Big heteroblivious shrug.)
But fandom cuts across all demographics, and everyone's deserves respect. One of my favorite viral videos of recent years shows a subway car full of New Yorkers singing the Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way" in unselfconscious joy. We should not be pressured to be so mature in our tastes that we miss all the fun.
In the Fugazi song "Bad Mouth," the punk stalwart Ian MacKaye sang: "You can't be what you were. So you better start being just what you are." As a younger woman, I adopted those lines as a cri de coeur, taken by the hard stance against nostalgia and sentimentality. But I have since reconsidered.
I drove home from the show listening to "That's Rock 'n' Roll" on repeat, knowing that a number of my friends were seeing the Cure that same night, my Gen X gloomster cohort having their own flashback moment. And I salute them.
Nostalgia can be a blinkering agent, but it can also be a benevolent time lord, allowing who you were and who you are to join hands. Through the alchemical magic of fandom, you can occupy both phases of your life at once -- sensible adult and keening fangirl. Steady sun and hormonal supernova, all of it just a song's play away.
That's the crush spirit. That's nostalgia. That's rock 'n' roll.

Full text: A prolific pianist, composer and arranger who began recording in the 1950s, he was a pioneer of bossa nova but didn't confine himself to any genre.
João Donato, a Brazilian composer, musician and producer who was a pioneer of bossa nova and who went on to cross-pollinate music across the Americas, died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. He was 88.
His death, in a hospital, was announced on his Instagram page. Brazilian news media reported that the cause was pneumonia.
Mr. Donato was in the coterie of Rio de Janeiro musicians -- among them Antonio Carlos Jobim, João Gilberto and the guitarist Luiz Bonfá -- who developed the subtle swing and harmonic sophistication of bossa nova in the mid-1950s.
But Mr. Donato didn't confine himself to any genre. In a recording career that extended from the 1950s into the current decade, he released some three dozen albums as a leader and collaborated with a wide range of artists on many more. Although he was best known as a keyboardist, he was also a singer, accordionist and trombonist.
As a pianist, Mr. Donato was known for his blend of a frisky, restlessly syncopated, harmonically intricate left hand with relaxed, sure-footed right-hand melodies. As a composer, producer and arranger, he constantly -- and playfully -- fused and stretched idioms and production styles. He once said he had a "sweet tooth for funky ideas."
Mr. Donato played MPB (as Brazilian popular music is widely known; the letters stand for "música popular brasileira"), jazz, funk, salsa, American pop and pan-American hybrids that were entirely his own. He worked with generations of Brazilian musicians, including the singer and movie star Carmen Miranda; the singers Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Milton Nascimento and Marisa Monte; and the rapper Marcelo D2.
He also recorded with Eddie Palmieri, Michael Franks, Mongo Santamaría and Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest. Throughout his life, he sought new grooves.
The president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said on Twitter: "João Donato saw music in everything. He innovated, he passed through samba, bossa nova, jazz, forró, and in the mixture of rhythm built something unique. He kept creating and innovating until the end."
João Donato de Oliveira Neto was born on Aug. 17, 1934, in Rio Branco, the capital of the state of Acre. He began playing accordion and writing songs as a child. In 1945, he moved with his family to Rio de Janeiro, where he began performing professionally in his teens.
Mr. Donato began leading his own groups in the early 1950s while also working as a sideman. He played accordion on Luiz Bonfá's first album, released in 1955, as part of a studio band that also included Antonio Carlos Jobim. Mr. Jobim produced Mr. Donato's debut album, "Chá Dançante" (1956), and Mr. Donato wrote songs with João Gilberto, including "Minha Saudade," which became a Brazilian standard.
But by the end of the 1950s, Mr. Donato's preferred style had grown so complex that audiences complained that they couldn't dance to it, and he had difficulty finding work in Brazil. He accepted a job backing Carmen Miranda at a Lake Tahoe resort, and relocated to the United States.

As the 1960s began, he was welcomed by Latin and jazz musicians. He recorded with Cal Tjader, Astrud Gilberto (who died in June), Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaría and Eddie Palmieri. (He played trombone in Mr. Palmieri's La Perfecta, a brassy salsa band Mr. Palmieri called a "trombanga.")
The vibraphonist Dave Pike recorded an entire album of Mr. Donato's compositions, "Bossa Nova Carnival," in 1962, and the saxophonist Bud Shank put Mr. Donato in charge of his 1965 album, "Bud Shank & His Brazilian Friends." "This is João Donato's baby," Mr. Shank wrote in the liner notes. "I've turned all the problems over to him and I just relax and play."
On his own albums for U.S. labels, Mr. Donato drew on jazz and Caribbean influences as well as Brazilian ones. His pivotal 1970 album, "A Bad Donato," was a radical turn toward funk, merging Brazilian-rooted melodies and rhythms with electric keyboards and wah-wah guitars. The keyboardist and arranger Eumir Deodato, who worked with Mr. Donato on that album, went on to have a worldwide Brazilian funk hit with his version of "Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)."
Mr. Donato returned to Brazil in 1973. There, a friend persuaded him to record songs with lyrics rather than solely instrumentals, including his own modest but earnest vocals. His tuneful, easygoing 1973 album, "Quem É Quem," was not an immediate hit, but it has been widely praised over the years; in 2007, Brazilian Rolling Stone placed it among the 100 greatest Brazilian albums.
Mr. Donato's new lyricists included two of the leading figures in the determinedly eclectic Brazilian cultural movement known as tropicália: Caetano Veloso, who put Portuguese lyrics to "O Sapo" ("The Frog") to turn it into "A Rã," and Gilberto Gil, who supplied lyrics for many of the songs on Mr. Donato's 1975 album, "Lugar Comum." Mr. Donato also wrote songs with lyrics by his younger brother, Lysias Ênio Oliveira.
For the next two decades, Mr. Donato recorded almost entirely as a sideman. The singer Gal Costa recorded "A Rã" for her 1974 album, "Cantar," and hired Mr. Donato as an arranger and bandleader for that album and her subsequent tour.
Mr. Donato also recorded extensively with important Brazilian musicians like Jorge Ben, João Bosco, Chico Buarque and Martinho da Vila. He continued to perform his own music and released a live album, "Leilíadas," in 1986. But he didn't return to making his own studio albums until "Coisas Tao Simples" ("Such Simple Things"), released in 1994, even as he continued to do session work with songwriters including Bebel Gilberto and Marisa Monte.
The albums Mr. Donato made after resuming his solo career were unpredictable and diverse. Some returned to his bossa nova-jazz fusions; some featured singers, including Wanda Sá, Paula Morelenbaum, Maria Tita and Joyce. Others had titles reflecting Mr. Donato's fondness for musical hybrids, like "Bluchanga" (2017) and "Sambolero" (2010), which won a Latin Grammy Award for best Latin jazz album. He also received a Latin Grammy for lifetime achievement in 2010.
In 2017, Mr. Donato made an album of synthesizer-centered funk, "Sintetizamor," with his son, João Donato, known professionally as Donatinho, who survives him. Other survivors include his wife, Ivone Belém, and his daughters, Jodel and Joana Donato. He lived in Rio de Janeiro.
In 2021, Mr. Donato collaborated with Jazz Is Dead, the Los Angeles-based project of Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Adrian Younge, on the album "Jazz Is Dead 7." In 2022 he released "Serotonina," an easygoing pop-jazz album featuring his electric piano and clavinet.
On Twitter, Mr. Veloso summed up Mr. Donato's music admiringly. It was, he wrote, "the highest achievement of extreme complexity in extreme simplicity."

Scoping Out People Is Part of His Plan: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Marc Rebillet, who became known during pandemic lockdowns for livestreaming improvised songs featuring electronic loops, takes his grooves to the streets.
In the spring of 2020, Marc Rebillet's improvised, solo funk shows, livestreamed on YouTube and Facebook from his apartment, became a lockdown sensation. Wearing a bathrobe and boxers, Mr. Rebillet posted a phone number and asked callers to suggest a word or theme that he'd use to write anthemic songs on the fly, belting them out in a power baritone. The tunes were danceable, subversive and hilariously raunchy.
Mr. Rebillet, 34, whose nickname, "Loop Daddy," refers to the electronic live-looping technique he uses in his compositions, now has more than 2 million subscribers on YouTube and has parlayed his online popularity into a more established career. He embarked on a sold-out national tour, hosts a show on Amazon Music's Twitch channel (Jack Black was a recent guest) and is the subject of a new documentary.
Since April, he's been performing pop-up concerts on city sidewalks for "We Outside," his newest livestream series. Mr. Rebillet welcomes the bits of chaos that passers-by bring. He has sampled a youth marching band and the howl of a dog named Cheeto. He was recently delighted when a man rolled into the crowd in a wheelchair, then leaped up to dance.
Mr. Rebillet is now planning a thoroughly un-chaotic studio album, one "that's layered and well thought-out, produced, composed, intentionally done," he said. He lives alone in Manhattan's Seaport neighborhood.
BODY WEIGHT These days, I'll get up probably around 6 or 7 a.m. I will usually do a workout in my apartment. I do this body-weight exercise program that I've been doing for like 10 years. It's called "You Are Your Own Gym." It's based originally on a book written by this guy Mark Lauren. He turned it into an app ages ago that I must have found while I was living in Paris. I was very scrawny at the time. Over the course of a few years, this program has become a very regular, every-other-day part of my life.
UNICYCLE MAN I'll get on my electric unicycle. (It's a pretty dorky name -- I tend to just call it a "wheel" because it's not nearly as silly.) I've got a few of them. You put the pedals down and you stand on it facing forward. They go like 45 miles an hour. It's like a little car. I go and get my little fruit bowl. There's a place up near Fulton Street called Healthy Green Juice Bar, and they will fix me a bowl of fresh fruit with a scoop of peanut butter. It's a perfect little breakfast: a little bit of protein, a bunch of fruit.
PEOPLE-WATCHING I might go to City Hall Park and eat my little fruit bowl, watch people start to move around and get the day started. And then I'll come back and start making preparations to get my car to my apartment and load it up with all of my equipment so that I can drive to some random place in the city, unpack it all, set up and play a show for strangers for a couple of hours.
POWER BUSKING What I usually try and do is find a location, like a street corner or a triangle or some plaza, the day before or a couple of days before. And this past Saturday, I really had nothing. And so I just decided to get in my car a little earlier than I normally would and drive and just land on the first place that my instinct led me and where a parking space became available -- that's kind of an important factor -- and then just do it there.
So, amazingly, I was driving around Union Square, and someone pulled out right as I was coming up behind them. I parked and got set up. And it was a really, really awesome show. A marching band showed up. It was the Brooklyn United, they're an all-Black marching band, kids who are basically raising money for the organization.
We were just playing the show, and it was pretty crowded at that point. And we hear in the distance, "ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta." Some people in the back clued me in that it was a marching band. I was like, "Get over here!" And people made way and they came right in. You can see it online. They came right on in and just killed it. I sampled them and made a beat with the drum sounds. That's the kind of stuff you just can't plan. I mean, I guess I could have planned it, but it wouldn't have been nearly as fun if I had.
AFTER PARTY About 5 p.m., I'll go and get a drink with my friends who hang around and help me pack my stuff back into my car. We'll go get a drink in the area, smoke a joint, sort of just bask in the afterglow and talk about fun moments and chew the fat. Then after that, I just can't go on anymore, so I get in my car and leave.
HOME/ANTI-PERSON At that point I'm just done, and I really just disappear. I stop answering texts and everything and I basically just sit around and watch YouTube. It's sad. It's like I become this anti-person that just sits. And I want an absence of stimuli -- nothing, just nothing. I'm not even looking at what I'm watching, really, I'm just existing. Of course, I'll call my mom. I always call my mom after the show. And she really wants to know how it went.
VAPE AND ICE CREAM Generally, I'll order something really, really greasy. I tend to have this feeling after these shows that, "OK, I've worked really hard and now I can do things that are not good for me." So, I'll usually get a bunch of ice cream and then I'll also get a nicotine vape. I'll just suck it down until basically I'm like a Roman emperor. I'm like: My belly's full, I've got grapes, I'm passed out on the couch just "uhhhhh." And then, I wake up in the morning and do my little workout like nothing ever happened.
NEAT FREAK Probably midnight, 1 a.m., I draw the blinds, I'll brush my teeth, put my stuff away, because I like to wake up in the morning to a clean kitchen. Everything put away, everything nice, in its place, so I can go to sleep like a little angel and not have to worry about anything the next morning. And also to not look upon the horrifying condition, the state of me the night before, you know.

New Zealand Wins Home Opener; Without Kerr, Australia Does, Too: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Shaken by a mass shooting and set against record crowds, the Women's World Cup opened on Thursday with matches featuring the co-hosts New Zealand and Australia that showcased the growth and promise of women's soccer but also some of the sport's persistent challenges.
New Zealand went first, beating Norway, 1-0, on a bitter cold night at Eden Park, the home of the country's famed All Blacks men's rugby team, and in front of the biggest crowd ever to see a women's soccer game in the country. Australia followed with a 1-0 victory over Ireland despite the untimely absence of its biggest star, Sam Kerr.
The New Zealand fans roared with delight when Hannah Wilkinson scored the tournament's opening goal by turning in a cross minutes into the second half. Her goal delivered New Zealand's first-ever World Cup victory in its sixth visit to women's soccer's showcase event.
"We put so much pressure on ourselves because it wasn't just about winning a game, it was about inspiring our entire country," the New Zealand captain Ali Riley said, adding, "I think we did it."
Across the Tasman Sea, Australia then beat Ireland in front of more than 75,000 fans in Sydney. But it did so without Kerr, its star striker, who sustained a calf injury the night before the game. Kerr will miss at least two games, Australia's team announced, becoming the latest elite player ruled out of a tournament already marred by knee injuries that have sidelined almost a dozen other top players.
Without Kerr, whose face adorns tournament posters across the continent-sized country, Australia created few openings against a stubborn Irish team and required a penalty from defender Steph Catley, its stand-in captain in place of Kerr, to ensure that like New Zealand it would open the tournament with a victory.
Two years in the planning, the World Cup opened only three miles and 12 hours removed from the site of a mass shooting in an office building under construction near the city's waterfront and down the block from Norway's team hotel. Three people died, including the gunman, and five were injured. The opening game began with a moment of silence to honor the victims.
The tournament also began with testy pretournament talk about rainbow armbands, unequal prize money and lagging ticket sales, and a first glimpse of the talent spread across its expanded 32-team field.
That expansion, fueled by investments in dozens of countries and efforts by FIFA, world soccer's governing body, to grow the women's game, has helped create perhaps the most wide-open tournament in its 32-year history. But it has also the prospect of competitive imbalance: Australia's opponent, Ireland, was one of eight newcomers in the field, each of them soon to face a daunting challenge against an established power like the United States, the two-time reigning champion, and European teams like Sweden and Spain, France and Germany.
Contradictions like that were already among the World Cup's story lines. Organizers have sold almost 1.4 million tickets, for example, but last week offered more than 20,000 others for free to fans in New Zealand, where sales have been disappointing. The teams were playing for a record pool of prize money -- $ 110 million, more than triple the amount of four years ago -- but dozens of players have complained that their federations have refused to offer them a fair share of the payouts.
Those disputes surely will continue as the tournament rolls out toward its final on Aug. 20 in Sydney. But on Thursday, at least, the focus was on the field, on the opportunities for new teams, on the rich rewards available to the players, and on a famous first for New Zealand, the star, for one night, of the biggest party in women's soccer.
Organizers will surely hope that Kerr can get healthy enough to join the party, too. The forward is the one undisputed superstar in the Australian ranks, with a celebrity in her home country that in many ways eclipses the sport itself.
It was her name that was by far the one most commonly emblazoned on the backs of fans sporting the golden Australian jersey as they made their way to what was by far the highest attended women's soccer game ever staged in Australia.
Kerr cut a forlorn figure in the moments before the game, walking out among the substitutes. Australian officials said Kerr would undergo an evaluation before the third and final group game. Kerr told her 1.2 million followers on Instagram that she wanted to share the news to avoid any distraction for her team. "I would have loved to have been out there tonight but I can't wait to be a part of this amazing journey which starts now," she wrote.
Without Kerr, and despite the narrow victory, that journey will almost certainly be a lot bumpier for the co-hosts.

July 21-22 at 7:30 p.m. at Union Hall, 702 Union Street, Brooklyn; unionhallny.com.
One of several refreshingly original performers emerging from a Los Angeles clown collective nurtured by Philip Burgers (a.k.a. Dr. Brown), Courtney Pauroso has made some ripples on the small screen, appearing in 2019 on Dr. Brown's "Two Pink Doors," part of the anthology series "Cake" on FXX/Hulu; and more recently on ABC's new series "The Prank Panel."
But onstage is where Pauroso is really shaking things up: When she brought her show "Gutterplum" to Union Hall in 2019, Jason Zinoman wrote in The New York Times that she had "a certain raucous aesthetic that proves that modern clowning can be not only scary and funny, but also disarmingly sexual." With her latest one-hander, "Vanessa 5000," which is at Union Hall this weekend, Pauroso takes that sensuality to an even more irreverent yet relevant level, playing a sex robot whose artificial intelligence makes her question her own existence.
Tickets are $ 15 and available through Eventbrite. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Drake and 21 Savage
July 20-21 at 8 p.m. at Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn; ticketmaster.com.
The fans flocking to see Drake this weekend may already have their Instagram captions selected -- after all, the Canadian megastar has spent a career channeling the millennial mood into highly memeable one-liners. Over the years, his influence has reached beyond the social media zeitgeist into the sound of pop music in general. Its increasing genre fluidity and evaporating distinctions between rapping and singing reflect Drake's own melodicism and tendency to zigzag between regional styles.
Since he last toured in 2019, Drake has released a handful of albums and mixtapes, including last year's breezy, club-inspired "Honestly, Nevermind" and "Her Loss," a prickly collaboration with the Atlanta rapper 21 Savage. The two artists have teamed up on a tour that is at Barclays on Thursday and Friday, and then at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m.
Prices vary for resale tickets, which are available from Ticketmaster. OLIVIA HORN
Benefit Concert for Creative Music Studio
July 22 at 8 p.m. at Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn; roulette.org.
Billed as an "evening of improvisation," this benefit concert for the Creative Music Studio offers more than a dozen of the most storied make-it-up-as-they-go artists from the jazz, avant-garde and creative music scenes, coming together in impromptu performances. John Zorn, that locus of independent artistry and collaboration, organized the show with the drummer Billy Martin and the violinist Gabby Fluke-Mogul, members of the C.M.S., an organization founded in 1971 by the musicians Karl Berger, Ingrid Sertso and Ornette Coleman.
The vibes player Patricia Brennan, one of the many ringers on the benefit's lineup, called the C.M.S. "indispensable for the development of improvisers and artists."Brennan will be joined by the likes of the guitarists Wendy Eisenberg and Mary Halvorson, and Kenny Wollesen, Cyro Baptista and Ches Smith on percussion, under the "curation" of Zorn. Expect unexpected configurations of musicians -- and also beauty, cacophony and marvels of spontaneous collective composition.
Tickets are $ 30 in advance at Roulette's website, $ 35 at the door, and $ 25 for students and seniors. ALAN SCHERSTUHL

Moth Night
July 22, 8:30-10 p.m., at the Staten Island Museum, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Building A; statenislandmuseum.org.
Poor moths. Even though they belong to the same biological order as butterflies -- lepidoptera -- they tend to be regarded less as pretty pollinators than as wardrobe-destroying pests.
But not at the Staten Island Museum's annual Moth Night, an ecological celebration at which young visitors can design their own wings and antennas and join the staff of the Staten Island Children's Museum for face painting and moth making. Families can also learn about conserving monarch butterflies from Cooper Keane, a 17-year-old citizen scientist who operates a mobile monarch museum.
The Freshkills Park Alliance will present activities like Bat & Moth, in which children will portray these animals, learning how bats use echolocation to detect prey. Little guests can play other wildlife roles in games that show how forest species rely on their senses of hearing and smell.
The Staten Island Museum will display its moth specimens, but it also invites aspiring naturalists to bring flashlights for a live viewing: The evening's highlight is a walk to observe creatures like owlet moths, June beetles and fireflies.
Tickets start at $ 5; registration is recommended. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
When the Lights Go Down: The Sex Scene
July 21-Aug. 3 at IFC Center, 323 Sixth Avenue, Manhattan; ifccenter.com.
With a title that nods to Pauline Kael, this two-week program consists of movies notable for their depictions of sex. It's a tie-in with the Aug. 4 release of "Passages," an acclaimed love-triangle drama from the director Ira Sachs -- not that IFC Center needed an excuse.
The sex isn't necessarily explicit (much of "Brokeback Mountain," showing on Friday, Sunday and July 28 and 29, involves passion deferred). It can motivate the action (a tryst reinforces the trust between Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly's characters in the Wachowskis' "Bound," on Friday, Saturday, Tuesday and Aug. 3) or be central to it. Focusing on an enclave of people who find themselves unfathomably, erotically drawn to vehicular accidents, David Cronenberg's unsettling "Crash" (on Friday, Saturday and July 30 and 31) considers the attraction of spectacle, the impulse to lose control and the relationship between humanity and technology.
The theater is offering a "ménage à trois" ticket special, which gives moviegoers a discount to see three films in the series or take two companions to one. BEN KENIGSBERG

PinkyDoll's Voices Charm the Internet: [Style Desk]

Full text: Her TikTok catchphrase has become a meme.
If you watch a livestream video hosted by the TikTok creator PinkyDoll, it won't be long before you hear her say, "Ice cream so good."
She will say those words again and again, her tongue hanging out as she noisily pretends to lick a cone.
Every time she utters the catchphrase, she is getting paid. This is her job.
PinkyDoll, whose real name is Fedha Sinon, became a social media celebrity this month thanks to the eccentric livestreams in which she mimics video game characters.
In a typical performance, Ms. Sinon, who is 27 and lives in Montreal, stares into the camera lens while delivering a set of canned phrases. As she streams, viewers send her digital gifts in the form of cartoon items like roses, dinosaurs and ice cream cones. Each item translates to a cash payment for Ms. Sinon. The gifts float onto the screen and Ms. Sinon reacts to each one with the same cartoonish mannerisms.
Her reaction to the ice cream cones has become a meme, with many people posting images of President Biden with his favorite snack along with the words "Ice cream so good."
Ms. Sinon speaks in a singsong voice that might be described as "sexy baby." Sometimes she pops corn kernels one at a time using a hot-hair flat iron. The effect is mesmerizing, nestled deep within the uncanny valley.
Ms. Sinon is what is known online as an NPC streamer. NPC stands for "non-player character," a video game character that comes preprogrammed and typically cannot be manipulated by the person at the controls. As such, an NPC's phrases and movements are often formulaic and repetitive. Ms. Sinon brings these rather mechanical characters to life.
She found herself playing the internet's main character when screen recordings of her streams went viral on Twitter last week. The producer and rapper Timbaland appears to be a fan, recently reposting a video to his personal TikTok account of Ms. Sinon breaking character during a livestream after noticing he was watching. Popcrave, a pop culture news account on Twitter, reported that Timbaland was ranked the top viewer of the PinkyDoll stream, based on gifts sent and time spent viewing. (A representative for Timbaland did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)
What Ms. Sinon is doing is considered by some to be fetish content. For certain viewers, there's something sexual about being able to control her every word and gesture by sending her this or that gift. For other viewers, she is just plain fascinating to watch.
Think of NPC streaming as an extension of cosplay -- a hobby in which fans dress as their favorite characters from books, television shows and movies -- said Carly Kocurek, a professor of game design and experimental media at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
"Often people will consume media and then think about different ways to either dress up or act as or mimic affordances of that character," Ms. Kocurek, 41, said. "I don't think this is unprecedented or unrelated to ways that people have been engaging with media, especially games," she added.
Ms. Sinon, who previously worked as a stripper and owned a cleaning business, said she started livestreaming on TikTok at the beginning of the year as a way to make money.
"I was just being cute," she said in a phone interview. "I remember someone saying, 'Oh my God, you look like an NPC. And then they start sending me, like, crazy money."
While watching others play the video game "Grand Theft Auto," she said she focused on some of the characters to get ideas for her TikTok work.
"I was like, 'I'm going to try to do it like them,"' she said. Still, she added, she is "not really sure" what an NPC is.
Her TikTok account has since grown to more than 400,000 followers. Tens of thousands of people regularly tune in to her livestreams.
It's fun, she said, coming up with reactions for each gift. "I could sit here all day, but I can't because I have a son and I got to eat," she said.
Ms. Sinon said she made between $ 2,000 and $ 3,000 per stream. Across all her social media accounts, which include Instagram and OnlyFans, she puts that number at $ 7,000 per day.
Other creators cashing in on this digital genre include Cherry Crush, who lives in Ohio and has more than a million subscribers on YouTube, and Satoyu727, an NPC creator in Japan with over two million TikTok followers.
"It's very stimulating, because it's fast and very repetitive, so people sit and watch it to see the next reaction or if I will break character or mess up somehow from too many gifts," Cherry Crush said in a direct-message interview for this article. (She would not give her real name, which she does not reveal online.)
Cherry Crush said she did not consider her livestreams to be fetish content. "I don't make my show sexually suggestive at all," she said. "I always thought it was just funny & entertaining."
Ms. Kocurek, the media scholar, said that viewers may see online content in ways that the creators might not have considered.
"There's something here about how people consume media and how things get decontextualized and sexualized, whether or not that's what the creator intended," she said. "It doesn't mean nobody's going to consume it in a sexualized way, but it may mean that that's not what the creator was trying to do."
Ms. Sinon, however, said she was unbothered by the variety of reactions.
"I don't really care what people say about me," she said. "If they want to think I am this or that, it's fine with me."
"At the end of the day," she added, "I'm winning."

Here to Help; How to Avoid Hunching at Your Desk: [Science Desk]

Full text: It's time to get up (and fidget).
My fragrance of choice for the past year is eau de menthol pain patch. I've had chronic back pain, but the cause is not a mystery: I hunch over my computer for hours at a time. Call it "online spine," "computer-generated back pain," or, in my case, "Mac back."
Unlike "tech neck," a common term for repetitive strain caused by looking down at phones and tablets, back pain caused by hunching over a computer can afflict the neck, shoulders and entire back, said Dr. Nnaemeka Echebiri, a physiatrist who specializes in spine and musculoskeletal medicine at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.
Backaches happen for a host of reasons and are best evaluated by your doctor, Dr. Echebiri said. But computer-related pain isn't uncommon: A 2021 study of 2,000 people who worked on computers found that 48 percent had back and neck pain. And a 2021 meta-analysis suggested that prolonged sitting was a "significant risk factor" for lower back pain.
I asked Dr. Echebiri and other experts how to prevent pain and keep your back strong.
Assess your work space.
Make sure your workstation, whether it's at home or elsewhere, is as ergonomically correct as possible, she said. Your arms should be positioned at right angles and your screen should be eye level, said Edward Wei, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. "I tell patients the cheapest option would be to get a stand for your laptop, or even a stack of books, and then a wireless keyboard," Dr. Wei said.
And be mindful of when you're jutting your head forward or compressing your neck to look at the screen more closely -- a common habit that was referred to as "neck scrunching" in a 2018 study in the journal Biofeedback. (Pain set in, researchers found, after just 30 seconds of scrunching.)
Take breaks -- and embrace fidgeting.
If you really want to reduce chances of dealing with "online spine," set a timer to get up and move every half-hour, if only for a few minutes, said Cara Prideaux, assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the Mayo Clinic. "Any activity is better than none," Dr. Prideaux said.
And, for the more sedentary among us, "micro-movement strategies," like fidgeting, might help stave off certain kinds of back pain. In a small 2019 study, researchers found that people who were observed to have more "fidget frequency" had lower incidences of sitting-induced back pain. (Though they added that more research is needed to explore this connection.)
Stretch when pains strikes.
If your back and shoulders are beginning to throb, try these simple stretches from Jessamyn Stanley, author of "Every Body Yoga." While seated, "take your right foot and cross it over your left knee," Stanley said. "Fold forward over your leg, if it feels comfortable, and then switch sides." Repeat a few times to open up the hips and relieve lower back pain, she said.
For upper back pain, try a shoulder-opening stretch: Grip your opposite elbows with both hands to make a picture-frame shape, Stanley said. Then move your "picture frame" above your head, open your chest and hold for a few breaths, she said.
Make core-strengthening exercises a habit.
A 2019 meta-analysis found that regular exercise was the most effective way to prevent recurring back pain. "Motion is the lotion," Dr. Wei said. "You've got to move."
Instead of treating your pain after the fact, consider a preventive approach, Dr. Wei said. Building movement and flexibility into your day, he added, is more effective for the long-term health of your back.
All of the experts advised focusing on your core -- which includes back muscles, hip flexors, glutes, quads and hamstrings. To strengthen them, Dr. Echebiri recommended yoga, the elliptical machine, walking and swimming. Dr. Prideaux suggested tai chi and Pilates.
Rethink your binge-watching position.
I confessed to Dr. Echebiri that I watch shows in bed while balancing a laptop on my chest, and he told me that this was a "position to avoid."
Instead, he suggested sitting upright in bed, putting a pillow vertically behind my back, and placing the laptop on a breakfast tray or a stand. "I know it's not as relaxing as reclining and watching TV," he said, "but it's definitely going to be better for your back and neck."
Similarly, I admitted to Dr. Wei that I often wear a heating pad like a cape. Don't normalize chronic back pain, he told me. If your pain lasts for more than three months, he said, see a doctor or a physical therapist.
How much sleep do you actually need?
Your sleep needs change as you age, and each phase of life brings unique challenges to getting quality rest. Dani Blum asked some sleep specialists about how many hours of sleep we all need and sought targeted advice for getting them.

The link between hormone therapy and dementia
A new study found a link between hormone therapy, often used to manage menopause symptoms, and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. But experts warn that the study results shouldn't alarm women so much that they abandon the treatment. Alisha Haridasani Gupta explores the study's findings and limitations.

Culinary Highlights of Greenpoint's Little Tokyo: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The number of Japanese businesses in North Brooklyn has grown in recent years. The food is worth your time.
Exploring the restaurants of Greenpoint's Little Tokyo
This is me resisting the urge to use the "a [BLANK] grows in Brooklyn" cliché. I'll say, instead, that there's something afoot in Greenpoint, Brooklyn: a spate of Japanese restaurants and businesses that opened in the past few years in an industrial section of the neighborhood.
I'm not the first to spot this. In February, Devorah Lev-Tov, a freelance reporter for The Times, wrote a deep dive on the rise of this "Little Tokyo." As she points out, many of the newer businesses are Japanese-owned and attract people looking for a North Brooklyn alternative to Japan Village in Sunset Park. But what of the food?
For bento boxes, mushroom skewers and yuzu ricotta ...
To start, Rule of Thirds, which opened just weeks before the pandemic, managed to make it to the other side with a creative menu of Japanese-inspired dishes. This isn't your sobo's restaurant, but the founding team did cut its teeth at the beloved two-in-one restaurant Okonomi + Yuji Ramen, in Williamsburg.
Unlike that intimate, 12-seat restaurant, Rule of Thirds is downright huge. It has a brunch and dinner menu that runs from small plates to skewers to entrees, so it's a great place for large groups. Here's my ideal dinner order: a heavy yes to the crispy maitake mushroom skewers with herby gremolata, and to the mazemen (brothless ramen noodles) with yuzu ricotta to start.
I'm still dreaming about the summer tomatoes dressed in kimizu sauce (egg yolk and rice vinegar) and scattered with puffed rice and smoked trout roe. That was my first taste of this year's tomato bounty, and I have to say, we're in for a treat. I decided against the pork tonkatsu, because I always seem to go for pork. But next time I'll make that my entree order and close it all out again with the delectable grilled mochi cake.
Then there's Acre, a Japanese-owned lunch counter that's nothing short of delightful. This restaurant serves exactly the kind of balanced, food-pyramid-friendly meals I crave after a week of over-the-top dining: bento boxes, garden salads, miso soup and Japanese egg salad sandwiches. This is where I got my tonkatsu fix, and it also makes a mean iced latte and has a little gift shop up front.
For a splurge (like nori-wrapped Wagyu beef tartare) ...
If you're looking for something more upscale, consider House Brooklyn or Restaurant Yuu. Both are French-inspired, omakase-style restaurants, though House Brooklyn is the more intimate of the two, serving just 16 diners over two seatings for $ 180 per person. It's hidden at the back of 50 Norman Avenue, which is also home to Cibone, a design store, and Dashi Okume, where you can get ready-made dashi broth or have a custom blend made. (We really do have it all here.)
House is closed for the month of July and already sold out for August, but the eight-week-old Restaurant Yuu is a very worthy alterative. I usually find fine dining to be a bit cold and overly formal, but this 18-seat restaurant is the opposite. The service is professional but warm, and I got a real kick out of watching each of the 18 well-executed courses come together before my eyes -- like nori-wrapped Wagyu beef tartare topped with sea urchin from Hokkaido and an exceptional eel and foie gras dish. (Note: I was informed that the entire menu was about to change after my dinner, but all the more reason to go back.) I also signed up for the $ 100 nonalcoholic pairing, all tea-based, and especially loved the restaurant's take on an espresso martini with milky oolong. At $ 250 per person without drinks, it's a splurge, but I can say with my whole chest that it's worth it.
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviews Mischa, Alex Stupak's new Midtown restaurant. Much of the hype surrounding the restaurant hinges on its $ 29 hot dog, which Pete finds both "obnoxious" and "glorious."
Openings: Alligator Pear, on West 30th Street, has tempura alligator bites and blue crab beignets on the menu; Lala's Brooklyn Apizza will bring New Haven-style pizza to Grimm Artisanal Ales, in East Williamsburg, this Saturday; and a new location of MáLà Project will open in Greenpoint on Friday.
Soo Youn reports on the chefs and catering companies that feed hundreds of band members, backup dancers and crew members for touring musical acts like Beyoncé, Paul McCartney and Lizzo.
Martinis au poivre, chicken soup martinis, caprese martinis: These are just a few of the creative (and some might say, deranged) cocktails appearing at bars around New York City, Becky Hughes reports.

What’s Gotten Into Martinis Lately?

Consider the paradoxical thought experiment known as the Ship of Theseus: If Athenians removed and replaced every plank of Theseus’ ship so that none of the original wood remained, would it still be Theseus’ ship? Or would it be a different ship entirely?
Alternatively, take a dirty martini: gin, vermouth, olive brine and a garnish. But swap the traditional dry gin for one washed with mirepoix. Use Manzanilla sherry instead of vermouth and a solution of chicken bouillon and MSG instead of brine, and garnish with olive oil. Is it still a dirty martini?
Jazzton Rodriguez, the creator of what he calls the chicken soup martini, believes it is. “People are starting to explore what the dirty martini can be, as a template,” said Rodriguez, a co-writer of the blog Very Good Drinks. His invention has drawn more than 600,000 views across Instagram and TikTok.
The cocktail has plenty of detractors. (“It’s not too late to delete this,” one wrote.) Then again, Rodriguez said, “there were people who were like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve never wanted to drink a drink more than this.’”
In New York City, drinkers can find a basil-infused, balsamic-dotted Caprese martini at Jac’s on Bond, an oyster mignonette martini at Mar’s, a radish-water martini at Naro and a squid ink martini at American Express’ new Centurion Lounge.
At Este in Austin, Texas, you can order a martini made with muscadet wine and kombu seaweed, and Dear Madison in Chicago serves a version with habanero mezcal and lime juice. One of the seven martini options at Dante Beverly Hills in Los Angeles includes tequila and crème de cacao.
“Martinis are so hot right now,” said Bryan Schneider, the creative director at the Manhattan restaurant Bad Roman. To capitalize on the current fascination with briny, savory cocktails, he developed one with an Italian American edge: the pepperoncini martini. When diners come to the restaurant, he said, “It’s one of the top things that people post about.”
Ryan Dolliver, the beverage director at Palmetto in Brooklyn, serves his take on the martini with pickled fennel and yuzu. “It’s essentially a savory, cold gin or vodka cocktail, but for the purpose of shorthand, we call it a dirty martini,” Dolliver said.
Although the term is of recent coinage, the essence of the dirty martini — adding olive brine to the classic cocktail — dates back to the start of the 20th century. Only a few decades later, drinkers started swapping out gin for vodka — a practice still considered a faux pas by martini purists.
In the 1980s and ’90s, bars began slapping the “martini” label on any drink served straight-up (shaken or stirred with ice, but served without it) in a V-shaped glass: The espresso martini, one famous example, was created in London in the early ’80s.
“We adapt our positions on what these things are to what customers believe they are,” Dolliver added.
Trevor Easton Langer, the bar manager who created the Caprese martini at Jac’s on Bond, agreed. “The word martini isn’t as much of a hard-and-fast rule as it is a descriptor of how you’re going to receive the drink. It’s much less about the contents and more about the glass.”
Not to mention the mystique. “There’s the suggestion of elegance, there’s the ceremony of ordering one,” said Alan Sytsma, the food editor of New York magazine. “People want things that are understood to be classic.”
When creating something new, he said, “you can either play with the ingredients, or you can play with the form. But when you start to really veer into these wild flavor combinations, and whatever form you’re making doesn’t immediately make sense to people, you’ve lost the thread.”
Sheryl Heefner, the general manager of Superiority Burger in New York, whose cocktail menu she described as “staunchly classic,” suspects that the manic accessorizing of the martini is born of competition.
In a city with more than 20,000 restaurants, “it’s becoming increasingly difficult to not only stay relevant, but to stay alive,” Heefner said. Building edgy takes on classics, she believes, is “driven by pushing to be creative and come up with the next best thing to go on TikTok, or whatever it is.”
As a result, we’re left with martinis au poivre (at Le Rock, in Rockefeller Center), washed with sushi rice (Albert’s Bar, in midtown) or garnished with a ball of mozzarella (Little Ned, in NoMad).
And just as there’s no right answer to the riddle of Theseus’ Ship, perhaps there’s none to the question of what qualifies as a martini.
But there is one thing most bartenders agree on: “Juice is maybe a little too far,” Rodriguez said. “If there’s juice in it, I’d be inclined to call it something else.”

After a Brief Pause, Iran Resumes Policing Women Who Defy the Conservative Dress Code: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The country's morality police disappeared from the streets late last year as the authorities tried to calm anti-government protests. Now, patrols are once again watching for violators.
Iran is once again deploying police officers on the streets to enforce its conservative dress code for women, which many have flouted since the protest movement that rattled the country began last fall, according to state news media and social media posts.
Months into the protests, Iran quietly withdrew the morality police from the streets in an apparent concession to try to calm the nationwide upheaval against the government. The protests began last September after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in custody after the morality police accused her of violating the dress code and arrested her on a Tehran street.
A spokesman for Iran's police force, Gen. Saeed Montazer al-Mahdi, said on Sunday that effective immediately, police officers would begin patrolling to "deal with those who, unfortunately, regardless of the consequences of dressing outside the norm, still insist on breaking the norm." He added that the patrols would "expand public security and strengthen the foundation of the family."
He said the police would first warn people caught breaking the hijab law governing dress, which requires women to cover their hair and wear long, loose clothing that hides the shape of their bodies. Those who still refuse to comply, he said, will be prosecuted.
It was unclear whether the authorities were again deploying the morality police -- a force that an official said in December had been dismantled -- or were requiring the regular police to do what the morality police had once done.
The mass antigovernment demonstrations focused at first on the mandatory hijab law, then expanded to encompass a variety of grievances, including other social restrictions, corruption, soaring inflation, a perpetually limping economy and political repression. The movement morphed into the biggest challenge in decades to Iran's entire system of authoritarian clerical rule.
Women tore off their head scarves and burned them, dancing in front of the flames. Many refused to put them back on even after the protests dissipated amid a violent government crackdown, in which thousands of protesters were arrested, hundreds killed and at least seven executed. University students chanted, "To hell with morality police!"
For months, the government largely looked the other way as bare heads proliferated across Iranian cities, hemlines got shorter and more Western-style clothing appeared in the streets.
But the hijab is too important a symbol of Iran's ultraconservative Islamic system of government for its clerical leadership to let go entirely, and while some conservatives called for compromise, others urged the government to do more.
Earlier this year, the authorities began shutting down businesses that they accused of serving customers who were not wearing the hijab, and announced they would use surveillance cameras to track women who were violating the dress code, among other enforcement measures.
In recent weeks, several celebrities have faced prosecution for breaking the law, including Azadeh Samadi, an actress who appeared unveiled at a funeral two months ago, according to local news reports. She was banned from social media and ordered to see a psychologist to secure written proof that she was not a sociopath.
Another woman caught driving without a hijab in Varamin was sentenced to a month of washing and preparing corpses for burial, the reports said.
After Sunday's announcement, it was not long before the promised patrols appeared to re-emerge. That evening, several photos of police officers and the white vans they use to transport detainees to law enforcement centers were published on Gershad, an application and Twitter account initially created by antigovernment activists that crowdsources user reports of police patrols so people can avoid those areas. Users had spotted the vans around Tehran, Iran's capital, as well as in the cities of Kermanshah and Shiraz.
Gershad said on Twitter that one user had sent in a photo on Sunday of two women police officers standing by a white van outside a mall in eastern Tehran. They warned passing women about wearing their hijabs improperly before entering the mall, it said.
State news media pushed back on such reports in an apparent attempt to downplay the new measure.
Tasnim, a semiofficial news agency, said that "under no circumstances" would the vans of the morality police return to the streets, though it acknowledged that police would once again enforce the hijab law.
If a video appeared on social media purporting to show police officers forcing people into vans, Tasnim said, "it is either fake or from an archive." The report went on to suggest that the purpose of such videos would be to undermine the government.
Yet, marked with the morality police's logo or not, the vans are widely viewed with fear and anger by many Iranians. One such video sparked outrage on social media when it went viral over the weekend. It showed a woman in a chador -- the long black cloak commonly worn by conservative Iranian women and female officers of the morality police -- pulling a woman who was not wearing her head scarf toward a van.
"Help, help," the woman who is being pulled shouts in the video.
But Javan, a newspaper affiliated with Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, declared the video "fake" on Monday, saying it and others like it "were distributed to create confrontation between women and the government."
For many Iranian women, the broader confrontation over the hijab is already resolved -- decisively in their favor. There is no going back to the days before the protests, they have said repeatedly in recent months.
Shiva, 44, a translator in Tehran who asked to be identified only by her first name to avoid legal repercussions, said she expected the new crackdown to play out differently in different neighborhoods, depending on how socially liberal they already were.
"How long will we endure this push and pull?" she said. "The taboo of the veil has been broken in our society. On the other hand, the regime is brutal."
In one indication of how inflamed the hijab issue has become, Iranian news media and social media alike were abuzz on Monday about the violent arrest of Mohammad Sadeghi, a theater actor who had been vehemently criticizing the new crackdown on an Instagram livestream at the moment of his arrest.
"If my friend, my sister and my mother want to wear clothes in a certain way, that has nothing to do with you," Mr. Sadeghi said, addressing the government and calling for resistance.
Soon after, the police raided his home, setting off a tussle during which he tried to escape out a window while screaming for help. It was no good: Mr. Sadeghi was soon taken into custody.

In Professional Debut, a Cuban Fighter Shows He Is Quickly Learning the Ropes: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Decorated as an amateur, Andy Cruz had an unusual entrance into the pros, fighting for more rounds than typical for a first-timer. Afterward, he had an eye on what could be next.
Andy Cruz toted his new title belt while he hugged friends and saluted his followers on Instagram Live. When he and his team gathered for a photo, Derek Ennis, the head trainer, draped his right arm over one of Cruz's shoulders. Everyone else stared at the camera; Cruz's attention was elsewhere.
He was focusing on the phone in Ennis's left hand. It was showing a livestream of a bout featuring the lightweight Frank Martin, a potential future opponent.
For Cruz, who won Olympic gold and three world titles as an amateur, it was another welcome-to-pro-boxing moment.
Fourteen months after splitting with his country's boxing federation, Cruz, widely regarded as the best Cuban amateur boxer of his generation, triumphed on Saturday night at the Masonic Temple in Detroit in an unusual, high-profile professional debut.
Where most first-timers fight four- or six-round bouts, Cruz went 10. While professional debuts are usually mismatches, Cruz faced Juan Carlos Burgos, a former world champion, for a minor title.
And in the lightweight division, which brims with big-fight possibilities, the focus quickly shifts from a boxer's latest win to his next challenge.
"I'm finally back doing what I love most -- boxing," Cruz said in Spanish. "I'm on the path. Great things are waiting for me in the future."
In amateur boxing, winning is strictly a measure of punches landed, and Cruz mastered the hit-and-don't-get-hit style that defines Cuba's program. Along with his Olympic and world titles, he twice won the Pan American Games.
But before Saturday's bout, Burgos had promised to give Cruz a bruising initiation into the professional ranks, where judges reward aggressiveness, punching power and technical skill.
"If Andy Cruz wants to show what they've been saying about him is true, he's got to come out and fight," Burgos said on Thursday. "The pressure is all on him."
The boxers spent the opening round taking the measure of each other, Burgos trying to use his size advantage and Cruz working to establish distance and rhythm.
Cruz quickly found both, popping Burgos with two jabs and a hard right in the third round. Just before the bell, Cruz leaned back to avoid a left hook, then whacked Burgos with a counter right. In the fourth round, Cruz started landing uppercuts, and by the fifth, Cruz, the slicker boxer, was stalking Burgos. A right hand to the jaw knocked a misty cloud of sweat from Burgos's head.
"A lot of times I thought I was close to knocking him out, but he always recovered," Cruz said. "I learned a lot, and I still have a lot to learn."
Ennis, the Philadelphia native who took over as Cruz's trainer in May, was impressed, but not surprised, at the quick transition. He has been schooling Cruz on the subtle, but important, differences between the two versions of the sport, drilling him on punching with power on offense and standing his ground on defense.
"He's only been with me two months, and he's picked up the defense and everything," Ennis said. "And he did it under the lights."
Cruz was originally scheduled to turn pro in May 2022 in Mexico, under a partnership between Cuba's boxing federation and a promoter based in Aguascalientes. But Cuban officials canceled his bout and left him behind while the rest of the team traveled to Mexico. At the time, officials blamed poor practice habits; Cruz suspects the decision was aimed at preventing him from defecting.
In June 2022, Cruz was arrested during a failed attempt to leave Cuba by boat and then barred from the country's boxing gyms. By November he had secured a passport, and then he left the country legally, relocating to the Dominican Republic, where he began the six-month process of obtaining a U.S. visa and a pro contract.
"He went through hell last year," said Jesse Rodriguez, one of Cruz's managers. "But nothing fazes him."
His three-year deal with Matchroom Boxing, with seven figures in guarantees, according to the promoter, was announced in May and has since taken him to two American cities rich with boxing history.
Cruz trains in Philadelphia, where boxing greats such as Joe Frazier and Bernard Hopkins made their name in the sport. The city now has contemporary stars like the welterweight Jaron Ennis, Cruz's stablemate and Derek Ennis's son, and the 122-pound champion Stephen Fulton, who will face the Japanese standout Naoya Inoue on July 25.
And Cruz's debut came in Detroit, home to Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson, and to the Kronk Gym, whose most famous world champion, Thomas Hearns, watched Saturday's bouts ringside.
Empty seats dotted the upper levels at the Masonic Temple, but the rest of the venue held spectators with deep boxing knowledge and a strong interest in local fighters.
Some turned out to support Jermaine Franklin, the heavyweight contender from Saginaw, Mich., about 100 miles north of Detroit. Others showed up for Ja'Rico O'Quinn, a 122-pound prospect from Detroit. And many came out for the headliner, Alycia Baumgardner, who is based in Detroit and who defeated Christina Linardatou to retain her undisputed championship at 130 pounds.
Cruz's contingent occupied a few seats in the front row of the lower bowl. The group included his fiancée, Melissa Broughton; the heavyweight contender Lenier Pero; and the rapper known as El Micha, who accompanied Cruz to the ring.
Midway through the bout, one Cruz supporter unfurled a Cuban flag and held it high.
Cruz appreciated the cheers, even if he could not hear them.
"I don't focus much on the crowd. I listen to my corner," he said.
Beyond Cruz, the lightweight division is both talented and in transition.
The undisputed champion, Devin Haney, is considering moving up to the 140-pound junior welterweight division. He is also facing a weapons possession charge in California. His father and trainer, Bill Haney, told ESPN he was "confident things are going to be worked out."
Gervonta Davis, the popular power puncher from Baltimore, recently completed jail time after a guilty plea in a hit-and-run case and is set to resume training.
Hypothetically, Cruz could eventually match up with either of them, as well as with Shakur Stevenson, the former 130-pound champion, or with prospects like Martin or Keyshawn Davis, whom Cruz defeated in the final at the Tokyo Olympics.
Before tackling those decisions, Cruz plans to spend a week savoring Saturday's victory.
As an amateur, big wins brought trophies and medals. Cruz's first professional win earned him a title belt made of red leather and gold plates.
"I've never held one in my hand," he said. "Now I can feel the difference."

The Red Berets Are Out: U.S. Tourists Stream Back to France: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prices are high, but Americans are opening their wallets for international flights and hotels. It's the latest evidence of consumer resilience.
Forget Emily. These days, a whole flood of Americans are in Paris.
People spent 2020 and 2021 either cooped up at home or traveling sparingly and mostly within the continental U.S. But after Covid travel restrictions were lifted for international trips last summer, Americans are again headed overseas.
While domestic leisure travel shows signs of calming -- people are still vacationing in big numbers, but prices for hotels and flights are moderating as demand proves strong but not insatiable -- foreign trips are snapping back with a vengeance. Americans are boarding planes and cruise ships to flock to Europe in particular, based on early data.
According to estimates from AAA, international travel bookings for 2023 were up 40 percent from 2022 through May. That is still down about 2 percent from 2019, but it's a hefty surge at a time when some travelers are being held back by long passport processing delays amid record-high applications. Tour and cruise bookings are expected to eclipse prepandemic highs, with especially strong demand for vacations to major European cities.
Paris, for example, experienced a huge jump in North American tourists last year compared with 2021, according to the city's tourism bureau. Planned air arrivals for July and August of this year climbed by another 14.4 percent -- to nearly 5 percent above the 2019 level.
"This year is just completely crazy," said Steeve Calvo, a Parisian tour guide and sommelier whose company -- The Americans in Paris -- has been churning out visits to Normandy and French wine regions. He attributes some of the jump to a rebound from the pandemic and some to television shows and social media.
"'Emily in Paris': I never saw so many people in Paris with red berets," he said, noting that the signature chapeau of the popular Netflix show's heroine started to pop up on tourists last year. Other newcomers are eager to take coveted photos for their Instagram pages.
"In Versailles, the Hall of Mirrors, I call it the Hall of Selfie," Mr. Calvo said, referring to a famous room in the palace.
Robust travel booking numbers and anecdotes from tour guides align with what companies say they are experiencing: From airlines to American Express, corporate executives are reporting a lasting demand for flights and vacations.
"The constructive industry backdrop is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen," Ed Bastian, the chief executive officer at Delta Air Lines, said during a June 27 investor day. "Travel is going gangbusters, but it's going to continue to go gangbusters because we still have an enormous amount of demand waiting."
Transportation Security Administration data shows that the daily average number of passengers who passed through U.S. airport checkpoints in June 2023 was 2.6 million, 0.5 percent above the June 2019 level, based on an analysis by Omair Sharif at Inflation Insights.
And in many foreign airports, the burst of American vacationers is palpable: Customs lines are packed with U.S. tourists, from Paris's Charles de Gaulle to London's Heathrow. The latter saw 8 percent more traffic from North America in June 2023 than in June 2019, based on airport data.
In a weird way, the rebound in foreign travel may be taking some pressure off U.S. inflation.
International flight prices, while surging for some routes, are not a big part of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, which is dominated by domestic flight prices. In fact, airfares in the inflation measure dropped sharply in June from the previous month and are down nearly 19 percent from a year ago.
That is partly because fuel is cheaper and partly because airlines are getting more planes into the sky. Many pilots and air traffic controllers had been laid off or had retired, so companies struggled to keep up when demand started to recover after the initial pandemic slump, pushing prices sharply higher in 2022.
"We just didn't have enough seats to go around last year," Mr. Sharif said, explaining that while personnel issues persist, so far this year the supply situation has been better. "Planes are still totally packed, but there are more planes."
And as people flock abroad, it is sapping some demand from hotels and tourist attractions in the United States. International tourists have yet to return to the United States in full force, so they are not entirely offsetting the wave of Americans headed overseas.
Domestic travel is hardly in a free fall -- July 4 weekend travel probably set new records, per AAA -- but tourists are no longer so insatiable that hotels can keep raising room rates indefinitely. Prices for lodging away from home in the U.S. climbed by 4.5 percent in the year through June, which is far slower than the 25 percent annual increases hotel rooms were posting last spring. There is even elbow room at Disney World.
Even if it isn't inflationary, the jump in foreign travel does highlight something about the U.S. economy: It's hard to keep U.S. consumers down, especially affluent ones.
The Fed has been raising interest rates to cool growth since early 2022. Officials have made it more expensive to borrow money in hopes of creating a ripple effect that would cut into demand and force companies to stop lifting prices so much.
Consumption has slowed amid that onslaught, but it hasn't tanked. Fed officials have taken note, remarking at their last meeting that consumption had been "stronger than expected," minutes showed.
The resilience comes as many households remain in solid financial shape. People who travel internationally skew wealthier, and many are benefiting from a rising stock market and still-high home prices that are beginning to prove surprisingly immune to interest rate moves.
Those who do not have big stock or real estate holdings are experiencing a strong job market, and some are still holding onto extra savings built up during the pandemic. And it is not just vacation destinations feeling the momentum: Consumers are still spending on a range of other services.
"There's this last blowoff of spending," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for the insurance company Nationwide Mutual.
It could be that consumer resilience will help the U.S. economy avoid a recession as the Fed fights inflation. As has been the case at American hotels, demand that stabilizes without plummeting could allow for a slow and steady moderation of price increases.
But if consumers remain so ravenous that companies find they can still charge more, it could prolong inflation. That's why the Fed is keeping a close eye on spending.
Ms. Bostjancic thinks consumers will pull back starting this fall. They are drawing down their savings, the labor market is cooling, and it may simply take time for the Fed's rate increases to have their full effect.
But when it comes to many types of travel, there is no end in sight yet.
"Despite economic headwinds, we're seeing very strong demand for summer leisure travel," said Mike Daher, who leads the U.S. Transportation, Hospitality & Services practice at the consulting firm Deloitte.
Mr. Daher attributes that to three driving forces. People missed trips. Social media is luring many to new places. And the advent of remote work is allowing professionals -- "what we call the laptop luggers," per Mr. Daher -- to stretch out vacations by working a few days from the beach or the mountains.
Mr. Calvo, the tour guide, is riding the wave, taking Americans on tours that showcase Paris's shared history with France and driving them in minivan tours to Champagne.
"I have no clue if it's going to last," he said.

At my boutique hotel high in the Swiss Alps, I returned from dinner, jet lagged and a tad tipsy, to discover that a television set inside a bathroom mirror had been turned on during turndown service. I pressed all of the buttons on the wall panel and then tried the switches on a control box next to the bed. Nothing.
Since I could not locate anything resembling a telephone in the room (remember, I was tipsy), I hoofed it to the lobby and returned with a receptionist to power down my "smart mirror." Twenty minutes later, already in my pajamas, I encountered a new challenge: No switch I turned, no knob I twisted would kill the bathroom lights. I closed the door, affixed a face mask over my eyes and made do.
These days, it's all about making do when I'm greeted by the glut of smart technology in hotel rooms. Voice-activated lights. Chatbot concierges. QR codes on television sets. Mobile browser or app check-ins. Texting the valet for my car. Don't even get me started with motorized drapes -- attempting to view the ocean in Miami was as difficult as tackling Faulkner. It's all infuriating. And overwhelming.
A recent study from the industry magazine Hospitality Technology and the University of Nevada's William F. Harrah College of Hospitality in Las Vegas, surveyed 100 hotel operators and noted that adoption across the industry of self-service features like check-in kiosks and mobile room keys is booming.
Proponents say the guest benefits behind these investments are numerous, from personalizing the hotel experience and anticipating guest needs to reducing their "friction" points and freeing up staff.
Neha Jaitpal, the global general manager for Honeywell's Building Technologies sector, oversees "intuitive" solutions for more than 2 million hotel rooms worldwide, working for companies like Accor and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts. "Imagine arriving at your hotel room after a long day of travel, and it's already adjusted to your preferred settings -- from the temperature, lighting and even the position of the drapes," she said. "Through automation, guest rooms can be personalized without the need for human interaction."
"Smart hotel rooms are about empowerment," said Robert Firpo-Cappiello, Hospitality Technology's editor in chief. "Contactless interactions were a survival pivot for hotels during the pandemic. People are used to them now. There is no going back."
Yes, some (young) travelers I've talked to love it.
"At the Wynn Hotel, I enjoyed having Alexa close the blinds, turn off the lights and play music," said Eddie Burns, 25, a drummer and touring musician. "I arrived super late and it was great to navigate everything from bed."
Power in the palm of your hand?
One "guest technology provider" is pushing guests to rely more heavily on their ubiquitous cellphones.
Sonifi Solutions, Inc., which works with global brands such as Hyatt and Marriott, generates unique QR codes for guests on their in-room television -- to activate, you scan with your phone camera, as you would a web-based restaurant menu, which takes you to an app or website. Then with their phones, guests control their TVs and lighting, connect with the concierge (by chat), order in-room dining or make a spa appointment. The "personalization" piece of the platform extends to the television, which based on guest behavior and information gleaned from a loyalty program, can be set to a yoga class for a fitness enthusiast or ESPN for a football fan.
"By streamlining mobile capabilities and letting phones be the place of fulfillment, it saves guests time," said Kara Heermans, a Sonifi senior vice president.
Juliana Colangelo, 33, a vice president at the wine and spirits marketing firm Colangelo & Partners, is a fan. (Note her age.)
"Smart TV QR codes get me what I need on my phone, from hotel gym classes to valet parking," she said, adding that she wishes that rooms had QR codes to leave staff tips. "I never carry cash anymore."
A system that wastes 'mental energy'
But please, can we go back? These "guest enhancements," touted as in-demand by hoteliers and the tech companies that make them, are not in demand by me. They have been, in fact, obstacles -- obstacles between me and sleep, me and the view that I had paid for, and me and firm pillows (in Miami, that request was not an option on the tablet, and no human answered the phone in housekeeping). What was once straightforward is now idiotically complicated.
"I used to walk into a hotel room and relax. Now it is a job to figure out how to use the lights and switch off the television, which, of course, is set to the hotel's promotional station," said Jill Weinberg, 67, a regional director with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and like me, a frustrated hotel guest. "Here is an entirely new system to waste mental energy upon every single time I travel."
Another quibble with "personalized" hotel rooms? They are impersonal. "Frictionless" functionality does not engender character or soul; people do. I like being welcomed by the front desk, to discuss restaurant ideas with the concierge and chitchat with the other staff, who more often than not have interesting local tips. I could care less if a room "knows" that I like Pilates and the thermostat set to a nippy 69 degrees. And I'm not downloading an app just to request towels. Can't I just ask housekeeping?
Other travelers want to, too.
Stephanie Fisher, an adviser with the luxury travel agency Local Foreigner, said many of her clients "request hotels with personalized service that prioritize guest relationships."
"The best memories come from connecting with people, not devices," she added.
Thankfully for me and many other guests, not all hotels are embracing technology as the magic bullet of the future. Some, like the Graduate Hotels, a chain of boutique hotels in college towns like Ann Arbor, Mich., and Nashville, are -- aside from Wi-Fi and some smart TVs -- intentionally analog.
"We are about nostalgia, the notion of transporting guests to a simpler time, so we never bought into remote anything," said Ben Weprin, founder of the Graduate Hotels. "We want guests to immerse themselves in the college community and then come back to their rooms to decompress. Our motto is: Out of the metaverse and into the universe."
In Europe, the only technology offered in the rooms of the Rocco Forte Hotels is high-speed internet. That's not to say technology is pooh-poohed: The doormen use an earpiece to communicate a guest's name to reception so they receive a personal greeting as they check in, and back-end systems track preferences so the wait staff might "remember" a guest's morning specialty coffee order. Cutting-edge, it is not. That is the point.
And that's fine by me. While the idea of human-centric lighting to match my circadian rhythm is a noble one, please, just give me a light switch. Perhaps a good, old-fashioned landline with a human at the other end, too. I'll be more than fine. I'll be a happier, more relaxed guest.

PARIS — Forget Emily. These days, a whole flood of Americans are in Paris.
People spent 2020 and 2021 either cooped up at home or traveling sparingly and mostly within the continental U.S. But after COVID-19 travel restrictions were lifted for international trips last summer, Americans are again headed overseas.
Although domestic leisure travel shows signs of calming — people are still vacationing in big numbers, but prices for hotels and flights are moderating as demand proves strong but not insatiable — foreign trips are snapping back with a vengeance. Americans are boarding planes and cruise ships to flock to Europe in particular, based on early data.
According to estimates from AAA, international travel bookings for 2023 were up 40% from 2022 through May. That is still down about 2% from 2019, but it’s a hefty surge at a time when some travelers are being held back by long passport-processing delays amid record-high applications. Tour and cruise bookings are expected to eclipse pre-pandemic highs, with especially strong demand for vacations to major European cities.
Paris, for example, experienced a huge jump in North American tourists last year compared with 2021, according to the city’s tourism bureau. Planned air arrivals for July and August of this year climbed by another 14.4% — to nearly 5% above the 2019 level.
“This year is just completely crazy,” said Steeve Calvo, a Parisian tour guide and sommelier whose company — The Americans in Paris — has been churning out visits to Normandy and French wine regions. He attributes some of the jump to a rebound from the pandemic and some to television shows and social media.
“‘Emily in Paris’: I never saw so many people in Paris with red berets,” he said, noting that the signature chapeau of the popular Netflix show’s heroine started to pop up on tourists last year. Other newcomers are eager to take coveted photos for their Instagram pages.
“In Versailles, the Hall of Mirrors, I call it the Hall of Selfie,” Calvo said, referring to a famous room in the palace.
Robust travel booking numbers and anecdotes from tour guides align with what companies say they are experiencing: From airlines to American Express, corporate executives are reporting a lasting demand for flights and vacations.
“The constructive industry backdrop is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen,” Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said during a June 27 investor day. “Travel is going gangbusters, but it’s going to continue to go gangbusters because we still have an enormous amount of demand waiting.”
Transportation Security Administration data shows that the daily average number of passengers who passed through U.S. airport checkpoints last month was 2.6 million, 0.5% above the June 2019 level, based on an analysis by Omair Sharif at Inflation Insights.
And in many foreign airports, the burst of American vacationers is palpable: Customs lines are packed with U.S. tourists, from Paris’ Charles de Gaulle to London’s Heathrow. The latter saw 8% more traffic from North America last month than in June 2019, based on airport data.
In a weird way, the rebound in foreign travel may be taking some pressure off U.S. inflation.
International flight prices, while surging for some routes, are not a big part of the U.S. consumer price index, which is dominated by domestic flight prices. In fact, airfares in the inflation measure dropped sharply in June from the previous month and are down nearly 19% from a year ago.
That is partly because fuel is cheaper and partly because airlines are getting more planes into the sky. Many pilots and air traffic controllers had been laid off or had retired, so companies struggled to keep up when demand started to recover after the initial pandemic slump, pushing prices sharply higher in 2022.
“We just didn’t have enough seats to go around last year,” Sharif said, explaining that although personnel issues persist, so far this year, the supply situation has been better. “Planes are still totally packed, but there are more planes.”
As people flock abroad, it is sapping some demand from hotels and tourist attractions in the United States. International tourists have yet to return to the United States in full force, so they are not entirely offsetting the wave of Americans headed overseas.
Domestic travel is hardly in a free fall — July 4 weekend travel probably set records, per AAA — but tourists are no longer so insatiable that hotels can keep raising room rates indefinitely. Prices for lodging away from home in the U.S. climbed by 4.5% in the year through June, which is far slower than the 25% annual increases hotel rooms were posting last spring. There is even elbow room at Disney World.
Even if it isn’t inflationary, the jump in foreign travel does highlight something about the U.S. economy: It’s hard to keep U.S. consumers down, especially affluent ones.
The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to cool growth since early 2022. Officials have made it more expensive to borrow money in hopes of creating a ripple effect that would cut into demand and force companies to stop lifting prices so much.
Consumption has slowed amid that onslaught, but it hasn’t tanked. Fed officials have taken note, remarking at their last meeting that consumption had been “stronger than expected,” minutes showed.
The resilience comes as many households remain in solid financial shape. People who travel internationally skew wealthier, and many are benefiting from a rising stock market and still-high home prices that are beginning to prove surprisingly immune to interest rate moves.
Those who do not have big stock or real estate holdings are experiencing a strong job market, and some are still holding onto extra savings built up during the pandemic. And it is not just vacation destinations feeling the momentum: Consumers are still spending on a range of other services.
“There’s this last blowoff of spending,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for insurance company Nationwide Mutual.
It could be that consumer resilience will help the U.S. economy avoid a recession as the Fed fights inflation. As has been the case at American hotels, demand that stabilizes without plummeting could allow for a slow and steady moderation of price increases.
But if consumers remain so ravenous that companies find they can still charge more, it could prolong inflation. That’s why the Fed is keeping a close eye on spending.
Bostjancic thinks consumers will pull back starting this fall. They are drawing down their savings, the labor market is cooling and it may simply take time for the Fed’s rate increases to have their full effect.
When it comes to many types of travel, there is no end in sight yet.
“Despite economic headwinds, we’re seeing very strong demand for summer leisure travel,” said Mike Daher, who leads the U.S. Transportation, Hospitality & Services practice at the consulting firm Deloitte.
Daher attributes that to three driving forces: People missed trips; social media is luring many to new places; and the advent of remote work is allowing professionals — “what we call the laptop luggers,” per Daher — to stretch out vacations by working a few days from the beach or the mountains.
Calvo is riding the wave, taking Americans on tours that showcase Paris’ shared history with France and driving them in minivan tours to Champagne.
“I have no clue if it’s going to last,” he said.

Pom Klementieff Likes to Fall From the Sky: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The "Guardians of the Galaxy" actress, who plays a villain in the new "Mission: Impossible" movie, considers "Gone Girl" feel-good viewing.
Pom Klementieff had just checked into her hotel room in London, and she was still relishing the butter chicken she had consumed an hour ago.
"It's summertime, but it feels like winter -- because London is always like that," she said in a call last month. "So I'm like, 'OK, I need Indian food."'
The 37-year-old actress, known for her fan-favorite turn as the empathetic alien Mantis in Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy" and "Avengers" films, was on the second city of the world promotional tour for her next superventure, "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," in which she plays an assassin hunting Tom Cruise's character.
"I love playing a villain," Klementieff, chipper and candid, said of her character, Paris, who was based on a male character from the original TV series that inspired the "Mission: Impossible" films. "There's something cathartic and a little bit insane about it that's really enjoyable."
The seventh "Mission: Impossible" film allowed her to exercise her stuntwork chops, like her boxing and taekwondo training, that had lain a bit dormant during her turn in the Marvel films.
"Mantis isn't the most physical fighter," she said. "So this was fun to get to play a rebel who loves killing, fighting, chasing."
Klementieff discussed how Tom Cruise got her hooked on skydiving, why "Gone Girl" is her comfort watch and why she's been obsessed with Jessica Chastain's performance in "A Doll's House" on Broadway. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
'Gone Girl'
I love watching it on Valentine's Day when I'm single, or on Christmas when I'm a little low because of family stuff. It's my feel-good movie.
Motorcycles
I taught myself to ride in the streets and the countryside in France. But now I'm actually doing proper training and I love it. I'm learning how to do a little skid, doing stoppies -- I want to learn how to do a wheelie next!
Doing My Nails
I love when nail polish has a name that makes me laugh -- Natural Connection, Sexy Divide. Usually I do the same color on every nail, or sometimes I do lilac on one hand but with the ring finger green, and then the other hand I do green with a lilac ring finger.
Horseback Riding
I found a ranch in Colorado that I love to go to -- it's my happy place. I have a horse there I love called Mister T. He's amazing. He goes so fast, but he listens, too. There are dunes so it looks like Star Wars; it looks like you're almost on the moon. It's just stunning.
@tattooist_doy
There's this incredible artist in Korea I love -- his Instagram handle is @tattooist_doy. He makes such delicate, intricate, beautiful tattoos. Years ago when I was in Korea to promote "Avengers," he inked a sweet violet on my forearm. It's a little flower I used to pick with my uncle in the woods when I was little. I'm planning to get another one with him the next time I go to Asia.
Quentin Tarantino
I remember falling in love with "Kill Bill" when it came out in theaters in Paris. It's one of the movies that made me want to become an actress. It made me want to assert my confidence.
Not-Safe-for-Work Socks
One of my agents years ago had a pair of socks that said "[expletive] you, pay me," and I was like, "I need those socks." So I bought them, and when I wear them, they make me laugh.
Baking
I enjoy baking because the steps have to be right, and the sizes have to be on point. I love making lemon meringue pie, and I'll draw a heart on it with raspberries. I love to make chocolate fondant; it's really easy. I used to do that for my boyfriends, when I had boyfriends, a long time ago!
Skydiving
I've jumped 104 times since October 2021, when Tom Cruise gifted me skydiving lessons as a wrap gift. I love the rush, I love the precision, I love how sharp it makes me. When I jump off a hot-air balloon very early in the morning and the sun is rising and it smells like mist -- it's magical.
Jessica Chastain in 'A Doll's House'
There's something so magical and inspiring about watching live theater. When you're onstage, it's like you're skydiving. You're jumping into the void. There's no one like, "Oh, there's a second take or a third take" or "Oh, someone is going to edit it." It's right here, right now. I saw Jessica Chastain in "A Doll's House" recently, and she was so raw and vulnerable. I can't stop thinking about it.

As the Years Pass, Artistry Doesn't Ebb: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Koho Yamamoto studied her art in an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II and then opened a school. At 101, she still finds time to teach.
"People keep making me older every day," said Masako Yamamoto, who is 101. "I don't remember my age anymore, so I'm surprised when people say how old I am."
Ms. Yamamoto is an artist, poet, calligrapher and teacher who ran the Koho School of Sumi-E, on the corner of Macdougal and Houston Streets in Manhattan, from the mid-1970s until it closed in 2010. (Sumi-e is a Japanese style of black ink painting.)
Born in San Jose, Calif., and raised there and in Japan, Ms. Yamamoto was incarcerated in three internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II: the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Bruno, Calif.; the Topaz Relocation Center near Delta, Utah; and the Tule Lake Segregation Center in Newell, Calif.
In Topaz, she learned about art and calligraphy from the Japanese American painter Chiura Obata, who gave Ms. Yamamoto her artist name, Koho.
"We had so much time in the camps, the artists made good use of it," she said.
When the war was over, Ms. Yamamoto said, she was given a bus ticket to travel to any location she wanted. She chose New York.
Her work has been shown most recently at the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum and at the Leonovich Gallery. After living in Greenwich Village for about five decades, Ms. Yamamoto moved to a nursing home in Forest Hills, Queens, last winter.
GOOD SLEEPER I wake up on Sundays around 9:30 or 10 a.m. I sleep pretty well. There was a time when I used to think too much late at night, like my mind was working too much. Then, I decided to forget about it and let things go.
ORDINARY MORNING I wash my face, put on clothes -- you know, the ordinary things. I'm not too hungry in the morning, so I have toast and coffee. Sometimes I'll eat some eggs. I forget I have a roommate sometimes because she is often gone, visiting her boyfriend.
SEEKING NICE BOYFRIEND Then I hang out in the lobby because it's good to get out. There are always people there, greeting each other, talking. Everyone is cheerful. Maybe I'll find a rich old man in the lobby someday. I'm still looking for a nice boyfriend.
BIG READER I used to be book crazy; all I did was read, read, read. My father once ran a countertop restaurant, and he would always scold me because I had a book in my hand and I wouldn't help out. Once, he threw a book I was reading into the trash. My father was a poet and a calligrapher who sometimes had a temper.
ARTISTIC FREEDOM I was grateful to learn about art while in Topaz. We used to say how lucky we were because there was so much free time. We told ourselves it was a wonderful time to be an artist because, in the outside world, you would need to work. Sensei Obata didn't pamper or allow you to get too close, but I admired him.
A SERIOUS LIFE I was part of the Topaz Poppy Poetry Club, where I wrote tanka [short Japanese poems]. I once wrote: "Sometimes I wish I could jump into the turmoil of humanity and live life seriously."
THE PAINTER'S MIND On occasion, people come to visit. Some of my students like to take a class, so I get to teach again. Everyone starts by only painting bamboo. I tell them to make their minds into nothingness. Your brush strokes can be weak or strong. You learn to paint quickly and are allowed to make many mistakes.
FRESH AIR The courtyard is a good place to get fresh air. Sometimes I see a friend; sometimes I eat a snack outside. Occasionally, I take a short walk with a visitor. I'm still pretty strong, probably from all the stairs I used to climb while living in a fourth-floor walk-up.
FADING MEMORIES I'm starting to forget things. I have been told I spontaneously sing songs and put on a performance, but I don't remember. I hope I can retain some of my knowledge.
GAME TIME Sometimes I participate in an afternoon activity, like bingo. I forget how to play, but once I sit down, someone shows me how.
EARLY TO BED At night, I don't watch TV or read books anymore. Around 10 p.m., which used to be very early for me, I say, "That's enough," and go to bed. Sleep is good -- it restarts your clock.

Full text: More Than Likes is a series about social media personalities who are trying to do positive things for their communities.
To Shirley Raines, they are royalty: The woman with the paralyzed arm who uses a shoelace as a sling. The man whose hands shake as he opens his bag. The little girl who, when seeing Ms. Raines and her bright coif, shouts "pink hair!"
Ms. Raines, 55, provides food, hygienic services and unconditional support to people without a home through her nonprofit in Los Angeles, Beauty 2 the Streetz. They are all "kings" and "queens."
This is how she sees the people she serves: royals who have been dealt a bad hand.
'It's become a little internet family'
Ms. Raines wants to spread that outlook -- and has harnessed social media to do so. A camera hangs in the truck where she passes out food, capturing moments that are uploaded to her TikTok and Instagram accounts (5.3 million and 373,000 followers) that she hopes are changing the narrative on homelessness. It is also a fund-raising device for an operation that runs entirely on donations, Ms. Raines said.
"People have grown to love some of the people that we support and take care of," Ms. Raines said. "It's become a little internet family."
Beauty 2 the Streetz became a registered nonprofit in 2019. Sydney Granados, the organization's executive coordinator, estimates that it feeds about 1,000 people each week, mostly on Skid Row, an area of Downtown Los Angeles. Some days, Ms. Raines brings McDonald's burgers. Other days it's pizza from Costco. Sometimes a chef in a food truck cooks enchiladas, chicken tortilla soup or vegan cauliflower steaks. Ms. Raines and her volunteers also hand out toiletries -- toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, shampoo -- and they even color hair.
"Homelessness is one of those very visual problems," said Ben Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the University of Southern California. "We see it all over the place, but actually seeing people for who they are, the humanity part, we often miss. These kinds of efforts that allow people to connect at a very individual level and be seen, I think, are hugely important for self-esteem."
Wherever she goes, Ms. Raines lifts moods, with some banter and light teasing. In March, when a man she calls Big T showed up wearing a too-tight jacket, Ms. Raines joked that he was going to "squeeze out like a biscuit." She's often seen wearing fluffy yellow sandals and long rainbow socks, and has learned American Sign Language to communicate with the deaf "kings and queens."
"She's very magnetic," Ms. Granados said. "She's enjoyable, funny, bright -- people love to be around her."
In 2021, Ms. Raines was named CNN's Hero of the Year, earning a $ 100,000 grant for her organization. The Beauty 2 the Streetz Patreon page pulls in about $ 6,000 each month, and the group also solicits donations on Venmo and Cash App. In recent months, those donations have allowed her to expand to San Diego, Las Vegas and Long Beach, Calif.
'My journey started with pain'
Ms. Raines's path to creating Beauty 2 the Streetz started in 1990, when she herself was without a home. Her son Demetrius J. Stephens Jr. spent a lot of time at her grandmother's home, in Compton, Calif. When Demetrius was 2 years old, she said, he accidentally swallowed an antipsychotic pill meant for one of her uncles and eventually died as a result. Ms. Raines was 23.
Ms. Raines "became a terror to this world," she said. "My journey started with pain, death, feeling like, 'why am I alive?"'
She had more children, moved into an apartment in Inglewood, Calif., with the help of a housing voucher, and got her first job as an adult working as a 411 operator. She began bodybuilding and became a fitness instructor before transitioning into a career as a medical biller.
Still, Ms. Raines said, suicidal thoughts shadowed her. "I endured a lot of freaking pain that people don't see," she said. "That's what drives this caboose."
After a heart-to-heart conversation in 2017 with her twin sister, who implored her to find greater emotional stability, Ms. Raines accompanied a friend to volunteer for Pauly's Project, a nonprofit serving homeless people in Los Angeles. She developed a rapport with some of the women she met, who kept complimenting her hair and makeup. So one day, Ms. Raines returned to a Pauly's Project event with beauty products from Sephora and a bucket of hot water. Ms. Raines dyed the women's hair and handed out makeup kits.
She eventually attracted a following so large that she went out on her own. She set herself up on Skid Row with a small team of volunteers, administering what she calls "spiritual C.P.R."
"Everybody wants to feel clean," Ms. Raines said. "Everybody wants to feel good about themselves. I have a queen right now, we did her hair purple a couple weeks ago. I've never seen her smile so big. Her hair, all the purple has washed out, but her smile is still the same, because of the lasting effects of all the praise she got when her hair was colored. Those things don't wash off."
Part of the appeal of her social media videos is the recurring cast of characters her followers have come to know -- and Ms. Raines's relationship with them. One woman, who had been pregnant in a previous video, recently showed up to the truck with her newborn.
"She had the baby!" Ms. Raines screamed ecstatically, turning to the camera. "She had the baby!"
The effort, though, hasn't been easy and has taken a toll. Her growing celebrity has been particularly tough on her children, she said. "When they were growing up, I was a woman with a short temper, partying, never had money for them to do anything," she said. "The world is calling me an angel, and they don't see me as an angel."
Ms. Raines thinks often of the son she buried. She is particularly moved by the children she serves who come to her without parents.
"I think they help me as much as I help them."

Full text: Fran Drescher, who became a household name for her role on a 1990s sitcom, is now president of the union going on strike.
The stage was different, and so was the tone. But the voice was unmistakable.
Fran Drescher, the owner of a distinctly nasal, Queens-inflected accent, made her name in Hollywood for her starring role in the sitcom "The Nanny." On Thursday, she appeared before dozens of cameras as the president of the actors' union that voted unanimously earlier in the day to go on strike, delivering a fiery argument depicting the stakes of the decision.
"The eyes of the world and particularly the eyes of labor are upon us," Ms. Drescher said. "What happens to us is important. What's happening to us is happening across all fields of labor."
She shook her fists in indignation. "I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us!" she continued. "It is disgusting. Shame on them!"
Ms. Drescher is the latest in a long line of familiar faces -- Ronald Reagan, Patty Duke and Charlton Heston among them -- to run SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents tens of thousands of screen actors. But it amounts to a surprising plot twist in her long career.
As the Thursday news conference made clear, she is now a leading face of a resurgent labor movement nationally. How she handles it in the coming weeks, and possibly months, could help determine the fate of 160,000 actors.
The actors' strike, which will go into effect on Friday, is a crisis point for Hollywood, which had already been rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts with the rise of streaming and the steady decline of cable television and box office returns. Hollywood writers have been on strike for months, and with actors now joining them -- the first time since 1960 that both are on strike at the same time -- the industry will essentially grind to a halt.
Ms. Drescher, 65, has spent decades acting in Hollywood, both in television and film. Since her starring role on "The Nanny" in the 1990s, by far her most prominent role, she has appeared sporadically in television and feature films. She most recently starred in an NBC sitcom, "Indebted," which lasted 12 episodes before it was canceled in 2020.
She has long expressed concerns about corporate greed, captioning photos with slogans like "STOP CAPITALIST GREED NOW." It was enough for New York Magazine to put a headline on a 2017 blog post, "Your New Favorite Anti-Capitalist Icon Is Fran Drescher."
A few years later, in 2021, Ms. Drescher won election to the guild presidency in a deeply contested race versus the actor Matthew Modine. They represented different factions: Ms. Drescher for the establishment Unite for Strength Party, and Mr. Modine for an upstart group, Membership First.
The race become so bitter that Mr. Modine accused Ms. Drescher of spreading falsehoods about him and reportedly said: "I'm ashamed of Fran Drescher, I'm disappointed. But she'll be judged by the people in the world after she's gone, or by whatever God she worships."
Unlike the screenwriters, who have gone on strike many times over the decades and have historically been unified, actors have been known more for their intramural squabbling. Hollywood had been bracing for a writers' strike since the beginning of the year -- but few senior executives and producers were prepared for the actors to have the resolve to go through with one.
When Ms. Drescher came into power she vowed to bring the union together and to bring an end to the "dysfunctional division in this union."
When the actors agreed to a strike authorization, it was with 97.9 percent of the vote -- a stunning figure that even eclipsed the writers' significant strike authorization. Last month, Membership First, the opposition party, endorsed Ms. Drescher's re-election bid.
Still, some of her public statements and actions in recent weeks have confounded many actors.
In late June, days before the actors' contract was set to expire, Ms. Drescher and the union's lead negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, released a video that struck many viewers as surprisingly upbeat given the high stakes of the negotiations.
"I just want to assure you that we are having extremely productive negotiations that are laser-focused on all the crucial issues that you told us are most important to you," she said, wearing a military jacket. "We are standing strong, and we're going to achieve a seminal deal!"
Just days later, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence, signed a letter expressing concerns to union leadership that they were not taking into account their willingness to strike. "We hope that, on our behalf, you will meet that moment and not miss it," the letter said.
Ms. Drescher -- curiously, given her position -- added her signature to the letter.
On Monday, days before the actors' contract was set to expire, Ms. Drescher drew attention on another front: She was attending a couture Dolce & Gabbana fashion show in Puglia, Italy, where she posed for photos with Kim Kardashian. To her 362 million Instagram followers, Ms. Kardashian said of Ms. Drescher: "To my fashion icon! Always on my mood board! I seriously love this woman!"
The backlash was quick and swift. The "General Hospital" actress Nancy Lee Grahn questioned if the photo was a joke. "I'm hoping this is not true. It can't be. No one could be this stupid," she wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the actors' union said that Ms. Drescher was working as a "brand ambassador" for Dolce and Gabbana, and that the commitment was "fully known to the negotiating committee." Mr. Crabtree-Ireland called criticism of Ms. Drescher's appearance at the fashion show "outrageous" and "despicable."
Ms. Drescher addressed the issue at the news conference on Thursday. "It was absolute work," she said, adding that she continued to communicate with negotiators from abroad. "I was in hair and makeup three hours a day, walking in heels on cobblestones. Doing things like that, which is work. Not fun."
While Mr. Crabtree-Ireland spoke at the news conference from a teleprompter, Ms. Drescher spoke off the cuff.
"Wake up and smell the coffee," she said of the studios. "We demand respect! You cannot exist without us!"
"They stand on the wrong side of history at this very moment," she continued, pointing her finger forcefully toward the camera banks. "We stand in solidarity in unprecedented unity. Our union, our sister unions, and the unions around the world, are standing by us."

Japanese Zom-Com Gets a French Remake: [Review]

Author: Loayza, Beatrice

Publication info: Loayza, Beatrice. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/japanese-zom-com-gets-french-remake/docview/2836977324/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A remake of a Japanese zom-com, this French adaptation about the making of a B-level zombie flick does little to justify its existence.
If you're going to remake a film whose footprint is still fresh, you better make it your own if not significantly better. The French zom-com "Final Cut" does neither -- the veteran filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius ("The Artist") may have an Oscar, but his uninspired riff on the Japanese movie "One Cut of the Dead" (2019) has got nothing on the original's ultra-low-budget charms.
In "One Cut of the Dead," a crew shooting a B-level zombie flick is attacked by the undead in a shaky single-take sequence that works despite its inexplicable pauses and blatantly phony severed limbs. We step into the making of the film-within-the-film, tracking the shoot from a chaotic behind-the-scenes perspective. The first half is fun, but the second half is golden, mining absurd humor, breathless tension, and movie-magic triumphalism from an onslaught of minor crises.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Hazanavicius's adaptation is an almost beat-for-beat copy: there's an ax-wielding makeup artist played by an actress (Bérénice Bejo) who goes frighteningly Method; a blood-splatterd "final girl" (Matilda Lutz) who lobs off the head of her lover (Finnegan Oldfield); some all-too-realistic practical effects courtesy of a drunken, vomit-spewing castmate and another player seized by a bout of explosive diarrhea.
Some tweaks account for Hazanavicius's French translation, the most intriguing of which further deepen the plot's metacinematic layers. "One Cut" exists within this world, too, with a Japanese cohort representing that film's rights holders looming over the director Rémi (Romain Duris). There's a long, fascinating history of Japanese and French cultural cross-pollination -- and both countries are home to two of the oldest, most robust film industries in the world -- but Hazanavicius works in the globalization of moviemaking only superficially, primarily through lazy culture-clash mockery: a Pearl Harbor joke here, a jab at the stereotypically poor French work ethic there.
"Final Cut" puts its predecessor's ingredients through an unflattering Instagram filter. The shoot's intentional shoddiness -- authentically kitschy in the original -- rings false, with Hazanavicius spelling out the crew's missteps in such a way that flattens the humor and kills the momentum.
In France, to make a film about the making-of-a-film is practically a rite of passage (see François Truffaut's "Day for Night," Mia Hansen-Love's "Bergman Island," or "Olivier Assayas's "Irma Vep"). With its metafictional bounties and playful genre bent, "One Cut" offers a conceit ripe for the picking. But what Hazanavicius has done here is a lifeless mock-up, a rehash made purely for audiences who'd prefer not to read Japanese subtitles. At least that's some kind of justification for its existence.

Full text: Tung has experienced a lot of changes since joining Amazon's hit coming-of-age series at 18. It's just one way her life mirrors that of her character.
Lola Tung was taking classes as a first-year acting student at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, when she heard the news. She had just been selected to play the lead in a new Amazon series called "The Summer I Turned Pretty," based on the best-selling young adult novel by Jenny Han.
"I was just in shock because I didn't expect this," Tung, 20, a New York City native, said in a video interview last month. "I called my mom after and we were just crying together over the phone, which was lovely. But it was the best surprise ever."
Tung, who was 18 years old and had acted only in school plays, took a leave of absence from college in 2021 to go to Wilmington, N.C., to join the production of the show, which tells a story of romantic awakening set at a beach house.
As summer commences and the show's two central families head to the coast, Tung plays Isabel Conklin, known as Belly, an adolescent girl who becomes caught in a love triangle with two of her childhood best friends -- who also happen to be brothers: Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno). The romantic tension captivated teen and young-adult viewers when the series debuted in 2022 and helped turn the show into a social media sensation. The hashtag #TheSummerITurnedPretty has accumulated millions of views on TikTok as users post fawning videos in support of "Team Conrad" or "Team Jere."
"I knew it would be special, but I think nothing can ever prepare you," Tung said. "There's no way to know how it's going to be received and how your life will change after."
Tung continued her college leave to star in the show's second season, which premieres on Prime Video on Friday. If watching the first season felt like basking in a perfect summer day -- full of pool parties, passionate kisses and Kim Petras lyrics -- the second season feels darker, cloudier, shrouded by loss.
Both Tung and her character have weathered a series of changes between the two seasons: Tung now has red-carpet interviews, a partnership with American Eagle and millions of Instagram followers; Belly has lost a close family friend and must fight to save the beach house. Both are learning what it means to grow up.
Ahead of the Season 2 debut, Tung spoke about her role, her favorite Taylor Swift music and whether she's on Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How do you get in the mind-set of preparing to play the role of Belly?
Music plays such a big part in prepping for different scenes. We were jumping around a lot emotionally in Season 2, so I think music was a way to very quickly get into the head space of the character, whatever scene it was. I would journal a lot and write a lot, especially from Belly's perspective. The first season, I wrote letters to each of the characters in Belly's voice, which was really cool. I think when you journal and you write just sort of like stream of consciousness you learn a lot about the character.
What were some of the songs you listened to for this season?
I listened to a lot of Mitski. "Two Slow Dancers" is a great song to listen to; it's a very reflective sort of song. A lot of Taylor Swift. Phoebe Bridgers was on the playlist, Dodi was on the playlist, Lizzie McAlpine; I think I have some SZA on here as well. It was a lot of slightly more emotional songs -- songs that felt nostalgic because Belly was really in this season dealing with a lot of changes in her life and dealing with the fact that change is inevitable. It's a hard thing to realize growing up. You know, how do you move forward and still stay in touch with that magic of childhood and the familiarity and things that you know?
What do you think this season says about the themes of change and loss and growth as a young person?
The characters have experienced a lot of growth and a lot of change since we last saw them. That's a really hard thing for all of them to deal with, and they're sort of on their own at the beginning. Season 1 was so much about these characters growing together and having each other to lean on. Season 2 is a lot about individual growth and how to take initiative, especially for Belly.
She's really isolated from the boys and from her family, and feeling completely lost without Susannah (Rachel Blanchard) there. It was really cool to get to figure out what the next step was for her and how she moves forward from the weight of grief. It's about learning that change is OK and normal. Even though things are different, everything will be OK.
Are there aspects of Belly's character you relate to? And are there aspects you feel are very dissimilar?
I definitely think we're pretty similar, and I absolutely bring some of myself to her. It's only natural if you're playing a character, especially one so close in age. She's a very emotional person and leads with her heart and cares a lot about the people in her life, especially her family, even if it's hard to express that sometimes. I think she's bolder than I am, and she's more of a risk taker, and that was something I thought would be a challenge. But I really enjoyed getting to tap into that part of her, and I learned from her in that way. I stole some of her boldness.
I saw that Taylor Swift teased her "Back to December (Taylor's Version)" song during the latest trailer for the show. Do you have a favorite song of hers you really resonate with?
I am a big fan of hers. I used to listen to her earlier albums like "Fearless" and "Speak Now" and "Red." I had a little CD player and I would listen to them while I was falling asleep. I have a lot of favorite songs. I think an all-time favorite is "You Belong With Me" and then I also love "Everything Has Changed." Right now I'm listening to "Mirrorball" a lot.
What are the dynamics for you with the other actors both on set and off set?
I feel so lucky that we all get along so well and that I've made some really great friends. Especially in the first season, we played whiffle ball a bunch and we would just go grab dinner whenever we could. We would car-pool together. When we had downtime on set, we would hang out and talk and play cards or chess. The guys loved playing chess on set, which I started to get into as well. It's fun when you're just sitting around waiting for the next setup in a scene to just play a quick game. I wasn't that great, but I had fun.
I have to ask -- are you on Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah?
I always say I am the biggest supporter of Team Belly, forever and always, and I will always stick with that answer because I really do believe that she's the only one who can make that choice. And if we're doing our jobs right, I think you can see why she loves both of these boys. Ultimately it's just about her following her heart.

As summer commences and the show’s two central families head to the coast, Tung plays Isabel Conklin, known as Belly, an adolescent girl who becomes caught in a love triangle with two of her childhood best friends — who also happen to be brothers: Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno). The romantic tension captivated teen and young-adult viewers when the series debuted in 2022 and helped turn the show into a social media sensation. The hashtag #TheSummerITurnedPretty has accumulated millions of views on TikTok as users post fawning videos in support of “Team Conrad” or “Team Jere.”
“I knew it would be special, but I think nothing can ever prepare you,” Tung said. “There’s no way to know how it’s going to be received and how your life will change after.”
Tung continued her college leave to star in the show’s second season, which premieres on Prime Video on Friday. If watching the first season felt like basking in a perfect summer day — full of pool parties, passionate kisses and Kim Petras lyrics — the second season feels darker, cloudier, shrouded by loss.
Both Tung and her character have weathered a series of changes between the two seasons: Tung now has red-carpet interviews, a partnership with American Eagle and millions of Instagram followers; Belly has lost a close family friend and must fight to save the beach house. Both are learning what it means to grow up.
Ahead of the Season 2 debut, Tung spoke about her role, her favorite Taylor Swift music and whether she’s on Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: How do you get in the mindset of preparing to play the role of Belly?
A: Music plays such a big part in prepping for different scenes. We were jumping around a lot emotionally in Season 2, so I think music was a way to very quickly get into the head space of the character, whatever scene it was. I would journal a lot and write a lot, especially from Belly’s perspective. The first season, I wrote letters to each of the characters in Belly’s voice, which was really cool. I think when you journal and you write just sort of like stream of consciousness you learn a lot about the character.
Q: What were some of the songs you listened to for this season?
A: I listened to a lot of Mitski. “Two Slow Dancers” is a great song to listen to; it’s a very reflective sort of song. A lot of Taylor Swift. Phoebe Bridgers was on the playlist, Dodi was on the playlist, Lizzie McAlpine; I think I have some SZA on here as well. It was a lot of slightly more emotional songs — songs that felt nostalgic because Belly was really in this season dealing with a lot of changes in her life and dealing with the fact that change is inevitable. It’s a hard thing to realize growing up. You know, how do you move forward and still stay in touch with that magic of childhood and the familiarity and things that you know?
Q: What do you think this season says about the themes of change and loss and growth as a young person?
A: The characters have experienced a lot of growth and a lot of change since we last saw them. That’s a really hard thing for all of them to deal with, and they’re sort of on their own at the beginning. Season 1 was so much about these characters growing together and having each other to lean on. Season 2 is a lot about individual growth and how to take initiative, especially for Belly.
She’s really isolated from the boys and from her family, and feeling completely lost without Susannah (Rachel Blanchard) there. It was really cool to get to figure out what the next step was for her and how she moves forward from the weight of grief. It’s about learning that change is OK and normal. Even though things are different, everything will be OK.
Q: Are there aspects of Belly’s character you relate to? And are there aspects you feel are very dissimilar?
A: I definitely think we’re pretty similar, and I absolutely bring some of myself to her. It’s only natural if you’re playing a character, especially one so close in age. She’s a very emotional person and leads with her heart and cares a lot about the people in her life, especially her family, even if it’s hard to express that sometimes. I think she’s bolder than I am, and she’s more of a risk-taker, and that was something I thought would be a challenge. But I really enjoyed getting to tap into that part of her, and I learned from her in that way. I stole some of her boldness.
Q: I saw that Taylor Swift teased her “Back to December (Taylor’s Version)” song during the latest trailer for the show. Do you have a favorite song of hers you really resonate with?
A: I am a big fan of hers. I used to listen to her earlier albums like “Fearless” and “Speak Now” and “Red.” I had a little CD player and I would listen to them while I was falling asleep. I have a lot of favorite songs. I think an all-time favorite is “You Belong With Me” and then I also love “Everything Has Changed.” Right now I’m listening to “Mirrorball” a lot.
Q: What are the dynamics for you with the other actors both on set and off set?
A: I feel so lucky that we all get along so well and that I’ve made some really great friends. Especially in the first season, we played whiffle ball a bunch and we would just go grab dinner whenever we could. We would carpool together. When we had downtime on set, we would hang out and talk and play cards or chess. The guys loved playing chess on set, which I started to get into as well. It’s fun when you’re just sitting around waiting for the next setup in a scene to just play a quick game. I wasn’t that great, but I had fun.
Q: I have to ask — are you on Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah?
A: I always say I am the biggest supporter of Team Belly, forever and always, and I will always stick with that answer because I really do believe that she’s the only one who can make that choice. And if we’re doing our jobs right, I think you can see why she loves both of these boys. Ultimately it’s just about her following her heart.

With War as Backdrop, Russian Sports Drama Deepens in the U.S.: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fencing is usually among the least visible Olympic events, but a year out from the Paris Games it is providing political, sporting and familial drama related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Three Russian fencers who renounced the 2022 invasion in written declarations and now live in the United States were granted eligibility to compete as neutral athletes, representing no country, in the American summer national championships that conclude Sunday in Phoenix.
And that's just the beginning of the drama. A top Russian coach has been fired after a star épée couple left three weeks ago for the United States. And a high-profile fencing divorce has touched the upper reaches of the Russian Olympic Committee and even led to the entry of "raspberry frappé" into the lexicon as a sword-fighting put-down.
One of the Russian fencers now training and coaching in San Diego, Konstantin Lokhanov, 24, is a former son-in-law of the president of Russia's Olympic Committee and the ex-husband of a two-time Russian Olympic fencing gold medalist. He won the men's saber competition at the American summer championships after having competed for Russia at the 2021 Tokyo Games.
After winning in Phoenix, the 6-foot-6 Lokhanov posed with a Ukrainian fencer while the two held a Ukrainian flag in a defiant show of support. Lokhanov had "Liberty" tattooed on his right forearm shortly after he arrived in the United States in May 2022.
The invasion represented a jarring turn in the personal and professional life of Lokhanov, who had married into the first family of Russian fencing and seemed embedded in a life of athletic royalty.
In 2020, Lokhanov married Sofia Pozdnyakova, 26, who later won gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics in the women's individual and team saber events. She is the daughter of Stanislav Pozdnyakov, 49, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee and himself a four-time Olympic gold medalist in fencing.
But the marriage quickly dissolved, and the breakup became public last September. Lokhanov said the divorce had occurred for several reasons, the ultimate one being the war. "I just said that I will not go back to Russia," Lokhanov said in a Zoom interview from Phoenix, which he called his first in English. In follow-up written remarks, he added, "I decided I could no longer live in a country that kills innocent Ukrainians."
Both Lokhanov and Pozdnyakova have said that she declined his invitation to leave Russia with him. She has said that she filed for divorce and that she was grateful to Lokhanov for many things but that the couple had gone in "different directions."
Pozdnyakov, the Russian Olympic chief -- speaking to Match TV, a sports channel owned by Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled energy corporation -- confirmed the dissolution of his daughter's marriage. With an apparent swipe at Western frivolousness, he told Match TV last September that his daughter's upbringing and "love for the motherland" had allowed her to avoid "the sad fate of frightened lovers of raspberry frappé and yellow scooters."
Lokhanov said he thought the remark was funny and unsurprising, even if he was not quite sure why it had been made. "I never had a scooter," he said with a smile. "I'm a big coffee lover, but not frappé."
In an Instagram post last December, Lokhanov said that he had entered a "truly black period" after his mother died of Covid-19 at age 43 at the end of 2021. After finishing a disappointing 24th in the saber competition at the Tokyo Olympics, he also faced the second of two surgeries in Germany for a hip injury that threatened his fencing career.
He flew to Munich for the second surgery on Feb. 23, 2022. A day later, Russia invaded Ukraine. During weeks of recovery in Germany, Lokhanov contemplated whether he should return to Russia. Instead, he flew to Atlanta in May 2022 to stay with a friend and then received an invitation to join a fencing club in San Diego.
He said he did not consider himself brave, only to have made a natural decision he does not regret. To remain in Russia, he said, "You need to forget that killing other people is bad."
When the invasion began, "everything split into black and white" for him, Lokhanov said, adding: "When I hear that everything is not clear, what is not clear? It's as clear as possible. To kill other people is bad."
Another Russian fencer now in the United States, Sergey Bida, 30, won gold in the team épée event at the American championships, two years after winning a silver medal for Russia in the same event at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.
"American athletes go to Russia and end up in prison," Jack Wiener, a New York lawyer who represents Lokhanov and Bida, said, referring to the basketball star Brittney Griner. "Russian fencers come to the U.S. and wake up with gold medals."
A third Russian, Oleg Knysh, 25, also competed in the American championships.
Among fencing powers, Russia and the former Soviet Union trail only Italy, France and Hungary in winning Olympic medals. So embarrassing was the departure last month of épée stars like Bida and his wife, Violetta Kraphina Bida, also a Tokyo Olympian, that Russia has fired its national épée team coach, according to Tass, the state news agency. (Kraphina Bida did not compete in the United States championships.)
The highly regarded coach, Alexander Glazunov, was dismissed "due to the flight of his athletes to the United States without the consent" of the Russian Fencing Federation, Tass reported on July 1.
International federations for some sports, including fencing, have begun granting eligibility to athletes from Russia and Belarus -- a close Russian ally that provided a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine -- to compete as neutrals without national symbols, following a path created by the International Olympic Committee.
That path is expected to extend to the Paris Games. If so, athletes from the two countries could potentially compete if they have not publicly endorsed the Russian invasion and are not affiliated with the Russian military or state security agencies.
But Lokhanov and Sergey Bida have given up a great deal in leaving Russia, including perhaps their immediate Olympic dreams. They are not American citizens, so they are not eligible to compete for the United States at the world fencing championships, which begin July 22 in Milan. And without extraordinary government intervention, it is a long shot that they will gain American citizenship before the Paris Olympics.
There appears to be zero chance that Russia would welcome them back. Lokhanov said he had no desire to compete for Russia again. The best options for him and Bida, according to Wiener, their lawyer, appear to be finding a third country that will grant them citizenship for the Paris Games or seeking to compete for the Refugee Olympic Team.
Or, Lokhanov said, perhaps he can defer his dream and compete in the 2028 Olympics up Interstate 5 from San Diego in Los Angeles.
"I dream about to go for the Olympics, driving my own car," he said.

Full text: The traveling culinary studio We Are Ona laid down roots in its founder Luca Pronzato's home city and invited friends to celebrate.
For the past four years, the culinary studio We Are Ona has been converting unconventional spaces around the world -- the 31st floor of a New York City office building, a tennis court in Milan, the onetime atelier of a 19th-century French photographer -- into temporary restaurants. Some operate for just a night, others for up to six months, and the studio's founder, Luca Pronzato, 31, approaches each one as an elaborate, site-specific production, relying on an international crew of chefs, artisans, designers and florists to bring his vision to life. Though he's organized 30 ticketed public pop-ups and over 500 private culinary events, he's never done the same thing twice.
Still, despite the nomadic, ever-changing nature of his business, Pronzato decided last year that We Are Ona needed a permanent home base in his native city, Paris, where he lives with his wife, Clara Cornet, 35, who works on Instagram's fashion team, and their son, Leo, 3. After securing a former taxidermist's workshop in the 10th Arrondissement, he embarked on a gut renovation to transform the space into a professional kitchen, an archive of past projects, a communal office for We Are Ona's team of 15 full-time employees and -- most important -- an atmospheric venue for hosting clients and friends. The existing finishes were removed to reveal limestone walls, floors constructed from railroad ties and original, wavy glass windows. And to give the space a modern touch, Pronzato added an all-glass enclosure that now serves as a meeting room.
Born to a Catalan mother and an Italian father, Pronzato grew up in his parents' small grocery store near the Palais-Royal and has been in the food industry ever since, doing everything from waiting tables at Parisian bistros as a teen to working front of house at Noma in Copenhagen. But, while passionate about haute cuisine, he ultimately decided to pursue a career outside of the traditional restaurant system. "I wanted to use all my knowledge of wine and service, but I didn't want to make a hierarchical restaurant," Pronzato says. "I wanted to create something that could operate horizontally, where I could enable the talent I had met over the years to express themselves in new ways."
"Ona" means "wave" in Catalan and, fittingly, We Are Ona launched its first pop-up on the beach in Caparica, Portugal, in 2019. "Our core team cooked lunch and then every night for 12 weeks we hosted a rotation of guest chefs from 12 different countries to prepare dinner," says Pronzato, who also enlisted local furniture builders and ceramists to set the scene. "On the final night of service, our team fed all of the visiting chefs a meal inspired by their menus."
In the time since, Pronzato has created a fully functional restaurant in a horse stable turned bath house in Arles and another in the artist Peter Shire's ceramics studio in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. For a dinner celebrating Paris Design Week in 2022, We Are Ona set up amid an exhibition by the curator and collector Antoine Billore entitled "Stolen Objects From the Sea." Wavy orange tables undulated through an old metal factory surrounded by hundreds of kitschy, vintage sea creature decorations and -- in keeping with the aquatic theme -- the tasting menu featured briny tuna carpaccio served with a toasted chile oil-based salsa and raw black mullet marinated in lime.
Though far smaller in scale, the debut of We Are Ona's Paris studio, on a crisp evening in spring, felt just as significant. Pronzato arrived at the event, a dinner for 16 friends and collaborators, just hours before his guests, having come straight from Los Angeles where We Are Ona hosted a weeklong pop-up at the headquarters of Perron-Roettinger, a creative agency known for its stage design for Rihanna and Beyoncé and retail work with brands like Cartier. He was preceded by the evening's guest chefs, Sayaka Sawaguchi and Gil Nogueira, who brought with them from their restaurant in the countryside of Champagne, Le Garde Champêtre, crates of fresh scallops, produce from their garden and cartoonishly large loaves of sourdough bread. After swiftly tying on their chef's whites, they got to work searing pigeons stuffed with veal pâté, laying them in the hot pan underneath a blanket of fresh rosemary. Meanwhile, Louis-Géraud Castor, the floral artist behind the Parisian studio Castor Fleuriste, set vases of Italian poppies on the table, organizing them in a gradient from red to pale yellow.
As the sun set, friends began to trickle in, accepting glasses of celebratory champagne. The designers Sébastien Meyer, 34, and Arnaud Vaillant, 33, of Coperni, known for their fashion shows that double as performance art, were seated next to the chef Mory Sacko, 30, who recently opened a restaurant with Louis Vuitton in St.-Tropez. Kenny Duncan, 35, a sculptor, found common ground with the chef Zélikha Dinga, 34, whose old-world desserts are presented with an artist's eye. Celine Pham, 35, the chef at the restaurant Inari in Arles, was happy to occupy a seat at the table, having cooked at several We Are Ona events in the past. Behind her was an oil painting of a young woman in tears, a self-portrait by her dinner partner, the artist Inès Longevial, 32.
"It feels appropriate to share the first of many culinary experiences in our new home with so many past collaborators, surrounded by some of my favorite design creations," said Pronzato as he pointed out the custom dining table and chairs made by the German design firm E15, with whom he's worked on past events, and the cabinetry by the Dutch company Reform, another frequent collaborator. For Pronzato, one piece of furniture in the studio holds particularly symbolic significance: a resin-dipped cotton canvas chair that the Italian designer Gaetano Pesce made for Bottega Veneta's spring 2023 show. "Four hundred people sat on 400 one-of-a-kind chairs," Pronzato said. "Pesce meant it to be a statement about bringing together a multitude of voices -- it's a sentiment that's really at the heart of what we do." Here, he shares his tips for hosting a communal meal to remember.
Set the Table With Souvenirs
At We Are Ona events, accessories from past pop-ups always make an appearance, creating a sort of exquisite corpse on the table. For his event in Los Angeles the week before the Paris studio opening, Pronzato has sourced custom furniture and splatter-painted ceramics from Shire, best known for his colorful contributions to the '80s-era Memphis Group design movement. At the Paris dinner, guests drank from Shire's coffee mugs -- unpacked from Pronzato's luggage just hours before -- in lieu of water glasses. The pieces contrasted dramatically with minimalist ceramic plates and candleholders that had been custom made for a previous pop-up in Portugal.
Choose Vases That Are Practical and Pretty
Castor's single-variety floral arrangements sat in vessels made for him by the Brittany-based artist Mathilde Martin. Ceramic, he says, extends the life of cut blooms better than glass because its opacity protects the flowers' delicate stems from UV light.
Serve a Meal That Tells a Story
The chefs for the evening were far more than caterers for hire. Their relationship with We Are Ona began in 2019 when Sawaguchi, who is Japanese, and Nogueira, who is Portuguese, were guests at the studio's inaugural pop-up. Their menu celebrated both the regional terroir of Champagne, where they live and run their restaurant, and each chef's cultural background. The pigeon was finished with a miso-enriched sauce and the scallops were sprinkled with Japanese furikake. Dessert was a poached pear with a Portuguese cream mousse stained grassy green with matcha, served alongside jellied confections in the shape of crystals that were flavored with leftover champagne. "Food," says Pronzato, "should be a conversation starter."

Trans Woman Wins Crown To Represent Netherlands: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Rikkie Valerie Kollé, 22, will represent the Netherlands at the 72nd annual Miss Universe pageant in El Salvador later this year.
Rikkie Valerie Kollé, Miss Netherlands 2023, can still hardly believe she won her country's annual pageant.
She spent all day on Saturday preparing for and enjoying every moment of the ceremony that night, which was attended by the reigning Miss Universe, the American R'Bonney Gabriel.
The show, which started at 8 p.m., flew by, "and two and a half hours later I was Miss Netherlands," Ms. Kollé, 22, said in a phone interview on Tuesday, adding that her victory "had finally sunk in."
Ms. Kollé's win is historic: She is the first trans woman to win the pageant in the Netherlands, and she will be the second openly trans woman to compete in a Miss Universe competition when she represents her country in El Salvador later this year.
As the first trans woman to be named Miss Netherlands, Ms. Kollé said she hoped to be there for her community and help young queer people, as well as raise awareness of the long waiting times for transgender health care in the Netherlands.
"I'm going to be an open book," she said. In February, a post on her Instagram account outlined her experiences as a child and her treatments as a teenager as well as an update about her gender-transition surgery.
But being an open book on social media comes with a lot of hate, too, and avoiding online negativity can be difficult. Ms. Kollé said she had faced a lot of online abuse and insults since winning the pageant, as had some of her close family members, including her mother and sister.
Ms. Kollé is not the first Dutch trans woman to reach the Miss Netherlands finals. Solange Dekker, a finalist from last year's competition who took home the title of Miss Social Media, went on to become the first Dutch Miss International Queen 2023 last month, an annual pageant for trans women.
When she goes to El Salvador, Ms. Kollé will be the second trans woman to partake in a Miss Universe competition. Spain's Angela Ponce, also a trans woman, was a finalist in 2018.
"We're really looking for the most beautiful woman in the Netherlands," said Monica van Ee, a member of the jury who chose Ms. Kollé this weekend. She is also the national director of Miss Netherlands.
She said that while national and international media had been interested to talk about Ms. Kollé's victory, a lot of people had sent upsetting and threatening messages attacking Ms. Kollé.
Anne Jakrajutatip, the owner of the parent company of Miss Universe who is a trans woman herself, celebrated Ms. Kollé's win in a statement.
"My Miss Universe superfan conversion was sitting in the front row while Angela Ponce, the first trans Miss Universe Spain, walked the runway for the first time," Ms. Jakrajutatip said, adding that she was happy to make a statement that "trans women are women -- and we are here to celebrate women."
Ms. Kollé, who is from the southern Dutch city of Breda, has modeled since she was a teenager. She said she chose to apply to become Miss Netherlands because pageants offered her a chance to tell her story.
As a model, she said, "you're a bit of a clothes hanger. Otherwise you mostly have to be quiet." But in the world of pageantry, she said, "it's also important that you have something to say."
Ms. van Ee, Miss Netherlands's national director, said that over the last decade or so, the pageant had modernized. Now, mothers, divorced women and trans women can participate, she said. "I took over Miss Netherlands because I wanted to make women stronger," Ms. van Ee said. "I want to inspire young girls."
She said she had been shocked by the number of negative responses from men and women.
The ideal winner of a Miss Netherlands competition must have an impressive presence and make heads turn when she walks into a room. She also needs a message that can inspire others, Ms. van Ee said. "Beauty comes from the inside," she said.
She said that Ms. Kollé had been the strongest contender. "Throughout the whole process, she was the most beautiful woman," Ms. van Ee said.
"I was chosen for who I am and my story," Ms. Kollé said, "and not because I'm a trans woman."

Full text: Kish, who will bring considerable TV experience to the role, succeeds Padma Lakshmi, who hosted the show for 19 of its 20 seasons.
Kristen Kish, an acclaimed chef who won the 10th season of "Top Chef" more than a decade ago, will return as the next host of the long-running culinary competition, Bravo announced on Tuesday. She will succeed Padma Lakshmi, who said last month she would be departing the show, which she had hosted for 19 of its 20 seasons.
Kish, who has hosted several other food-related series, will take the reins for Season 21, which the network has said will take place in Wisconsin. She will join the food writer Gail Simmons and the chef Tom Colicchio at the judges table.
"'Top Chef' is where I started my journey -- first as a competing chef, then a guest judge and now as host, I have the honor of helping to continue to build this brand," Kish said in a statement. "It feels like coming home."
Kish, who was adopted from South Korea and grew up in Kentwood, Mich., attended Le Cordon Bleu in Chicago. She then spent a decade working at restaurants in Boston, rising through the ranks to become the chef de cuisine at Barbara Lynch's crown jewel restaurant, Menton.
As The New York Times reported in 2014, Lynch had encouraged Kish and another young chef from her restaurant group to compete on "Top Chef."
Kish won Season 10, and has become a familiar face on the show in recent years as a guest judge. She has also opened her first restaurant, released a cookbook and has hosted or starred in several shows including "36 Hours," a Travel Channel show that is a collaboration with The Times; "Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend," and "Restaurants at the End of the World."
Ryan Flynn, an NBCUniversal senior vice president, said in a statement that Kish was "the perfect host for the next chapter of 'Top Chef' as we take on a new region of the country we haven't explored."
Both Colicchio and Simmons published posts on Instagram Tuesday afternoon applauding the choice of Kish.
"She is an excellent chef, brings a world class perspective and most importantly, having been a past contestant and judge, she knows what it takes to win @bravotopchef," Colicchio wrote.
"Psyched beyond words to have her pull up that seat at Judges' Table," Simmons said.
In a statement to The Times on Tuesday, Kish added that she was already "overwhelmed by the amazing outpouring of support by the fans of 'Top Chef' embracing this new chapter."
"I am eager to get started!" she said.

These Hot Ice Cream Spots Will Keep You Cool: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: It's hot, sticky and sweltering. Time for ice cream.
Well, folks, it's miserable out there. The heat, the humidity, the bugs, the wildfire smoke, the impending threat of El Niño.
But at least we have ice cream.
Yes, it's finally that time of the year for my annual newsletter about the undisputed champion of summer (after mosquitoes). Here's my new list of frosty options for those days when nothing will cool you down except a frozen treat. Be sure, too, to check out last year's dispatch, as most of the recommendations still stand.
A combination ice cream and natural-wine shop
New York is the land of weird mash-ups. The hot dog shops that also sell papaya juice. A wonderful bakery tucked into an otherwise nondescript office building. And don't forget the ice cream shop/natural-wine bar.
That last label belongs to Caleta, on the border of the East Village and Alphabet City. Right across the street from Tompkins Square Park, this is an ideal place to drop by for an inspired scoop of Bad Habit ice cream. The flavors change constantly, but are always reliably interesting, whether it's coconut stracciatella, a not-too-sweet cafe con leche or burnt cheesecake.
You could stop right there, with a cone or a pint to go, of which there are plenty. But if you're feeling hungry, you can take a seat at the bar and try one or a few glasses of a sparkling red from the Czech Republic or an orange wine from Spain while noshing on warm sourdough bread with salted butter or a heaping plate of smoked prosciutto. In other words, exactly the type of low-lift meal that defines the season.
Go hard on soft serve
When the soft-serve wars begin, where will you stand? As a Mister Softee loyalist? With Ray Alvarez and his Candy Store? Upon mountains of boba milk tea soft serve from Xing Fu Tang? Or by the side of Morgenstern's Bananas and its dairy-free soft serve?
Unlike at the original Morgenstern's, the list of options at this offshoot is relatively short and (all) sweet. And if you hate bananas, you'll be happy to know that there are plenty of creative and classic alternatives, including coffee hazelnut, a chocolate option that's richer than any other chocolate soft serve I've ever had, and coconut Thai tea. There's also a fridge stocked with seltzer and water, a useful antidote for that thirsty feeling you always get after a scoop or three.
An oldie but very goodie
If all those newfangled flavors have you in a twist, I always reserve a space in my recommendations for a classic, no-fuss option. This year that honor goes to Eddie's Sweet Shop in Forest Hills, Queens. For some, this old-school soda fountain's existence may be old news (it is, after all, the city's oldest ice cream parlor), but in a city that is constantly in flux, it bears repeating just how amazing this place is.
Eddie's gets pretty busy on weekends, with families jockeying for a table or a seat at the counter, where they can enjoy vanilla ice cream and sundaes served in delicate sterling silver dishes. If you don't plan on staying, though, I recommend very, very politely pushing your way to the front of the line and letting the cashier know you're just here for a cone -- there's no real discernment between those who are dining in or dining out. But then again, you have to be a little pushy to make it here anyway.

A Frenetic Loop Loses Steam: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Ten years after "Sharknado" spun Twitter and TV together, the online water cooler is running dry.
On July 11, 2013, a superstorm made landfall on the internet. "Sharknado," the meteorologically and ichthyologically dubious disaster movie, premiered on Syfy, and Twitter lost its collective mind.
Like many an actual storm, this happening was the product of two fronts converging: The old pop-culture force of television and the newer one of social media. "Sharknado" did well enough on cable, but it was a smash on Twitter, where its ridiculous premise -- a maelstrom dumping rain and carnivorous sharks on Los Angeles, with only Ian Ziering standing between us and doomsday -- lent itself perfectly to instantaneous reactions and drive-by jokes.
The ensuing snarknado also seemed to goose the TV ratings. Hundreds of thousands of viewers switched on the movie after it began, suggesting that they'd gotten wind through Twitter of the bananas spectacle that was unfolding.
"Sharknado" may not be long remembered as cinema, but it is a historical emblem of the way millions of people shared the experience of live TV at a certain time. A decade later, that time is ending, because of the ways Twitter and TV have changed.
Like foil-tray frozen meals, which were used by airlines before Swanson branded them as "TV dinners," Twitter was not initially invented to be an adjunct to the tube. But it turned out to be a delicious accompaniment to have on your lap during a show. It, like a TV broadcast, was live and linear. It made the entire world into an improv "Mystery Science Theater."
There were, of course, many Twitters existing in parallel: Politics Twitter, Sports Twitter, Black Twitter, Weird Twitter. But Twitter and TV went together like extreme weather and marine predators. You might tweet after reading a book or going to a movie. Twitter especially fit the immediate, real-time experience of watching a TV show as it aired.
The platform, founded in 2006, also came along just as TV's cultural cachet was rising, with a growth in ambitious, talk-about-able appointment series. "Mad Men" and "Breaking Bad" premiered during its run; twist-heavy serials like "Scandal" and "Game of Thrones" delivered the kind of OMG moments that got them trending regularly. Twitter lent itself to appreciating great TV and to goggling at trash; it was equally a vehicle for "Isn't this amazing?" and "What the hell are we watching?"
From its beginning, TV has been both an isolating medium -- you in your living room with your stories -- and a social one. When the first sets were rolled out as curiosities in the 1940s, spectators gathered in bars to watch boxing matches. The Super Bowl, the biggest TV show of the year, became a secular holiday gathering that rivals Christmas. And before the work-from-home era, networks were conscious of the "water-cooler effect" in offices.
Twitter made the watch party global. It invited comments and conversation from fans and critics; series creators logged on to engage, and sometimes fight, with the audience. It created a feedback loop for shows to respond to or push against.
Twitter had grander ambitions and darker influences too -- the Arab Spring, the 2016 presidential campaign. But TV Twitter wasn't entirely about escapism. It promoted conversations, for instance, about how "Thrones" used and misused sexual violence. It lent itself to communal deconstruction of debates and election nights the same way it did to "American Idol."
That also meant that it was susceptible to the problems of Twitter at large: trolls, harassment, the general souring of the vibes.
Social media is only as virtuous as the people using it. With Donald J. Trump in office, using Twitter as a cattle prod to shock the country to attention multiple times a day -- often over cultural topics like N.F.L. protests or "Roseanne" -- there was a sense that every day on the site was a battle. That attitude was reflected in users who saw themselves as soldiers, eternally fighting to shift the front lines of the discourse an inch or two in the correct direction.
Then came Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive and Twitter power user who paid $ 44 billion in 2022 for the dubious honor of becoming poster-in-chief. He ran the site haphazardly; there were new charges and limits and outages, as well as the restoration of tweeters banned for abuse and disinformation.
But beyond that, Musk just gave off the sense that the most unpleasant aspects of the site were his favorite parts. "It is infinitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter," he recently posted, "than indulge in the false happiness of hide-the-pain Instagram." Good luck with that ad slogan!
Like all reflections on Twitter, mine is vulnerable to mistaking my experience as universal. I cut back on tweeting a couple years ago, and I've scarcely posted since last fall -- less out of business or political objections than from hating the way the site made me feel like an exposed nerve. When I lurk there now, my feed is notably slower than it used to be. Things are still happening, in the world and on TV, but they're not happening in my timeline.
I know that Twitter remains lively for other communities and users, from niche fan groups to the Muskophiles who bought blue verified checks when the owner began selling them like stars for Sneetches.
But in my corner of the app -- the fans and critics who gathered to riff on TV and the real-life events that filtered through it -- it feels like the end of an era. Even the finale of "Succession," a big deal among my affinity group of TV junkies and media obsessives, felt like a trickle next to the big tweetwatches of the 2010s.
That era's end is not all about Twitter. TV itself has changed since 2006. Streaming made it less live and simultaneous: Maybe you haven't finished watching Season 2 of "The Bear," or maybe you polished it off by breakfast time on the day it dropped. Outside live news and sports, the conversation around TV is functionally more like that around film and books.
The social-media universe is different too. The energy has shifted to platforms like TikTok that divide the user base between creators and commenters, makers and consumers, instead of promoting conversations. Even the ventures looking to replace Twitter may not reproduce it, and they may not want to.
Threads, the competitor from the company Meta, launched without a key feature that made Twitter Twitter: the ability to read tweets from people you follow in chronological order. That particular might change, but the live-feed approach that once made Twitter an incomparable second screen for TV is not necessarily the priority of the tech business of 2023.
And -- again to overgeneralize from my experience -- users may not want a second Twitter either. I was a heavy Twitter user for over a decade. I loved it until I didn't. I made connections, grew a following, floated ideas, had fun. But it also became a second, often angry, voice inside my head. Do I want to replace it with another one? (I have, God help me, joined Threads.)
People will always want to talk to people about the things that excite them. Maybe the next round of TV conversation will take place in smaller, more bespoke forms of community that I am not tech entrepreneur enough to imagine.
But just as the big three TV networks amassed a giant audience in the 20th century, then lost it to cable and the internet, the appeal of bringing the entire world into one big group chat might be over. This is the way a phenomenon ends -- not with a sharknado but a whimper.

How Dopamine Influences Behavior: [Science Desk]

Author: Smith, Dana G

Publication info: Smith, Dana G.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The neurochemical has become a boogeyman for people worried about addiction and indulgence. But the real story is a lot more complex.
The neurotransmitter dopamine is eliciting a lot of panic these days.
According to books, articles and social media posts, our urge for a quick dopamine hit is why we crave cookies and spend too much time on Instagram. If we keep giving in to these desires, the rationale goes, we'll never be able to stop ourselves.
"We've transformed the world from a place of scarcity to a place of overwhelming abundance," Dr. Anna Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist, wrote in her best-selling book "Dopamine Nation." Consequently, we're all at risk for "compulsive overconsumption."
A self-improvement trend often called "dopamine fasting" that emerged in 2019 revolves around abstaining from anything that causes the release of the chemical. The premise is that modern-day entertainments rewire the brain so that slower-paced pastimes are no longer pleasurable.
Videos tagged #dopamine, many claiming to teach viewers how to manipulate the brain chemical, have more than 700 million views on TikTok. One influencer offers a "free list of things that numb dopamine" so that you can "reclaim control over your life!"
Parents are even advised to prevent children from experiencing spikes in dopamine (meaning not to let them play video games or eat junk food) lest the insatiable need for the neurotransmitter increase bad behavior.
Scientists who study dopamine say these concerns have been blown out of proportion. They "are not necessarily based on actual science of what we know about dopamine," said Vijay Namboodiri, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco.
Before you swear off dopamine -- and the prospect of any joy in life -- it's important to understand the biggest misconceptions about the neurotransmitter and what the research shows.
Dopamine is not inherently good or bad.
The idea that dopamine produces feelings of pleasure came from early experiments in rodents, and later humans, that found the dopamine system was activated when animals encountered a reward. Food, sex, drugs and social interactions all set off releases of dopamine in the brain, suggesting the neurochemical is linked to any feel-good outcome.
But upon further study in the 1990s, scientists realized that dopamine is more closely related to the anticipation of a reward than to its receipt. Dopamine causes the wanting of something and the motivation to go and get it, not the enjoyment of it.
"What we think it maybe does is something like desire," said Talia N. Lerner, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Northwestern University. "It teaches your brain how to predict your needs and try to align your behaviors with those needs."
A neurochemical that controls desire can sound sinister, but pursuing rewards is not inherently a problem; it all depends on the context. Animals from honeybees to humans developed dopamine systems to motivate them to seek out food and sex in order to survive and procreate.
"It's an important part of why we're here today," said Kent C. Berridge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan. "We wouldn't have evolved and we wouldn't have survived, our ancestors, without dopamine."
Dopamine is also essential for learning. In this context, the key element that causes dopamine neurons to fire is surprise, regardless of whether the outcome is rewarding or disappointing.
"Dopamine tells you not when something is good or bad, per se, but when it's better or worse than you expected it to be," Dr. Lerner said. That surge of dopamine helps you update your expectations and potentially modify your behavior for the future.
A normal hit of dopamine isn't going to rewire your brain.
Because of dopamine's role in motivation and learning, the worry is that highly stimulating activities will hijack the neurotransmitter system, such that it no longer works for smaller, everyday rewards. For someone hooked on video games, the thinking goes, Monopoly might be less rewarding.
This concern is partly based in science. Prolonged use of drugs that cause huge surges in dopamine, like cocaine and amphetamine, can cause the brain to shut off some of the receptors that the neurochemical acts on. This so-called tolerance means that more of the drug is required to achieve the same high.
Because video games and pornography can be habit-forming, some researchers -- including Dr. Lembke -- have hypothesized that they might cause similar signs of tolerance in the brain. However, in an interview with The New York Times, she admitted that this theory is inferred from studies of stimulant drugs and that there isn't currently evidence to back it up.
As a result, Dr. Berridge and others have critiqued the idea. One reason is that the amount of dopamine released in response to video games, pornography, social media and junk food is substantially lower than that released in response to addictive drugs.
And while, for some people, video games cause a greater dopamine response than board games do, that doesn't mean the board game causes a smaller dopamine release than it used to, and it isn't because of an inherent change in the dopamine system, Dr. Namboodiri said. It also doesn't mean that video game lovers will never want to play board games again. The same goes for eating candy versus eating fruit or watching YouTube versus reading a book.
Taking a break from video games or social media can be a good idea if you want to spend more time on other pursuits. But that's not because you need to reset your dopamine system, Dr. Namboodiri said. (There is reason to believe that our digital lives have shortened our attention spans, but that's a different story.)
"If the advice that someone's giving you about what you should do holds regardless of whether dopamine is in play, it's probably useful advice," Dr. Namboodiri said. But he noted that "as a field we are still pretty far from having a complete understanding" of dopamine and how to manipulate it in daily life.
Addiction is about more than dopamine.
Some rewarding behaviors can cause problems in people's lives. Although activities like gambling, watching pornography and playing video games don't stimulate as much dopamine release as drugs do, they can lead to patterns of behavior similar to those seen in substance use disorder -- namely, continuing the activity despite severe negative consequences.
But that is the exception, not the rule. Most people are not losing their jobs or relationships or experiencing negative health impacts because of these activities. Roughly 2 to 3 percent of people who watch pornography report being addicted to the behavior. Similarly, 2 to 3 percent of people who play online games qualify as having internet gaming disorder.
"For some people, yes, this is a problem," Dr. Berridge said. "It's not a problem for most people. We can function in the world and enjoy this reward-rich world." As with most things related to health, the key is moderation. You don't have to deny yourself pleasure to be a good or healthy person.
And while dopamine is involved in addiction, compulsions to use drugs or masturbate are more complicated than a single neurotransmitter. "To say that it's only dopamine is an oversimplification," Dr. Lembke said.
In fact, experimental attempts to treat addiction by altering dopamine activity in the brain haven't worked. These types of compulsive behaviors are also often accompanied by other mental illnesses or extreme stress during childhood.
"Unless you're using a drug like cocaine, which is probably blanketly unhealthy, there's not necessarily a healthy or unhealthy way to use dopamine," Dr. Lerner said. "It's just about learning. And you can always learn something good, you can always learn something bad."
Or, as Dr. Berridge put it, "dopamine is our friend, not just our enemy."

Using A.I. to Make the Most of Family Time: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Plan meals, find gifts and create stories using generative A.I.
Hello! We're back with another bonus edition of On Tech: A.I. , a pop-up newsletter that teaches you about artificial intelligence, how it works and how to use it.
Last week, I walked you through how to turn artificial intelligence into a tutor and research assistant. In the final installment of our how-to editions, we'll take what we've learned and use it to make the most of family time.
We'll focus on a few tasks that can take up a lot of mental bandwidth at home. Weekly meal planning is a major chore, and gift giving can be daunting, with various birthdays and holidays throughout the year. And any adult who has read books for children knows that it can become repetitive, and the books aren't always relatable to a child's situation or growing pains.
Here's how A.I. can help.
Meal plans
Foodies and private chefs have been enthusiastically using A.I. to sketch out comprehensive meal plans that consider people's preferences and dietary restrictions. (Cooks are less gung ho about A.I.-generated recipes, which can be a disaster if a bot screws up.)
It turns out that brainstorming meals is a borderline superpower for a chatbot like ChatGPT or Bing. As always, the more detailed you are with your requests, the better. For example, a private chef posting on Reddit shared an example of a prompt asking for a three-day meal plan for a diabetic vegan with a nut allergy.
I asked ChatGPT for a meal plan formatted in a printer-friendly chart that can be stuck on the refrigerator. Here is my prompt:
Act as a private chef. I have a family of two, me and my wife. Plan meals for us for five days, including breakfast, snacks, lunch and dinner. We like Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Italian food. I like meat; my wife prefers chicken and seafood. We have no restrictions. We are trying to shed a few pounds after the pandemic.
The chatbot came up with this:
Generative A.I. often produces different results from the same prompt. If you want to shuffle the deck and get slightly different menu suggestions, you can always enter the prompt again. And by all means, tweak the instructions for different results.
What about the actual recipes to make these dishes? I followed up with this prompt: "Can you find recipes for all of those meal suggestions? Please include a link to the recipes online so I can check the source."
ChatGPT responded with a long list of recipes from sites including The Food Network, BBC, and a number of specialist food blogs.
(The subscriber-only version with GPT-4 produced the best results here; the free version with GPT-3 returned some broken links, presumably because its training data is older. Microsoft's Bing's chatbot is also good at this type of query, but Google's Bard bot declined to return specific links to recipes.)
One last trick: Ask your bot to compile a list of ingredients for all the recipes. It can even group them by grocery store aisle.
As always, to play it safe, double check the recipes to make sure your bot isn't hallucinating.
Gifts
Let's move on to gift giving -- a talent that some of us possess more than others. There are several A.I. tools that aim to make selecting a gift easier, including a website that comes up with gift ideas based on someone's Instagram profile.
I preferred DreamGift, which uses a chatbot to ask you a series of questions about your gift recipient's age, gender, interests and hobbies, along with how much you're willing to spend, and automatically provides ideas and links to order the items online. (My wife confessed that she liked some of the bot's gift suggestions, which included an indoor herb-growing kit, more than some of the gifts I'd given her over the years. Ouch.)
If you prefer to use a chatbot, that will work, too. Bing and Bard, which are connected to search engines, are powerful shopping assistants. The trick to getting bespoke recommendations is to share voluminous details about your budget and the people you're shopping for.
Storytelling
Let's end with something more creative. You can use A.I. to create a customized bedtime story or even your own hard-copy children's book.
Give a chatbot like ChatGPT or Bard a detailed prompt that includes your child's preferred storytelling style, any details you'd like to include and the situation that you want the story to address. Here's a prompt I wrote for a hypothetical child who is unhappy about moving to a new home. I asked it to involve some familiar characters:
Act as a children's book writer, mimicking "Frog and Toad." My kid is going through a rough time -- we are moving to a new home and changing schools. Write a story to help him process that. Incorporate our dogs, Max and Mochi the corgis, as characters.
The chatbot generated a heartfelt story about Max and Mochi, a pair of furry siblings. They enjoyed playing in the park and were sad to move to a new home. But they supported each other and eventually went to a new school, where they made new friends: Bella the sprightly Beagle and Charlie the cheeky Chihuahua. Everything worked out in the end.
If you're feeling extra ambitious, you can generate illustrations to accompany the text. (We covered image generators in an earlier newsletter.) I asked Midjourney to produce an illustration for a children's book of two corgis playing in a park together.
To produce a full book, I'd ask Midjourney to generate images to accompany each paragraph of the chatbot's story. Then I'd use a photo service that offers a book option, such as Google Photos or Shutterfly, to have the custom-made children's book printed and shipped to me.

Full text: You get a freckle tattoo, you get a freckle tattoo. Everybody gets a freckle tattoo!
On a recent June morning in Brooklyn, Chloe Sarre nearly drifted into sleep on a bed in a cozy room as a makeup artist used a needle dipped in a semipermanent liquid pigment to carefully prick about 20 microscopic dots across her cheeks.
Keila Cummings, the artist and a co-owner of Browstress, a cosmetic tattoo shop, was blotting off excess ink with a baby wipe as Ali Gatie's "Used to You" floated through her 10th-floor studio in the neighborhood of Dumbo.
"Oh, that doesn't hurt at all," said Ms. Sarre, a 35-year-old women's fitness trainer who lives in Brooklyn. "Honestly, the eyebrow waxing is worse."
Before her appointment, Ms. Sarre had drawn specks on herself with an eyebrow pencil to wear the latest beauty trend that thousands of people across the country are trying out: freckle tattoos. Available in the shape of hearts, stars or even astrological signs, the melanin-filled skin marks, once a cause for schoolyard torment, have become the latest TikTok obsession.
Freckle tattoos are created with the same pigment used for eyebrow microblading, another cosmetic treatment in which semipermanent pigment is etched into the surface of the skin. The effect of microblading is fuller and thicker brows.
The procedure for these artificial sun kisses takes around an hour and is less painful and permanent than a traditional tattoo. It lasts about eight months to two years, depending on skin type, sun exposure and how often the recipient exfoliates, and the cost starts at about $ 200 to $ 500, depending on tip, location and how many someone gets.
Freckle tattoos began coming into vogue around 2018, said Krystal Cummings, Keila's 36-year-old twin sister and a co-owner of Browstress. She said she learned how to do them after a client's request.
"She told me to call her when -- not if -- I started doing them," said Krystal, whose nose is sprinkled with freckles she tattooed herself.
Krystal, a former 911 operator, opened Browstress in 2018. She was inspired to learn about microblading when her aunt was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo chemotherapy, which made her eyebrow hairs fall out. She watched YouTube tutorials, practiced on herself and mastered the touch required to make the freckle tattoos look natural.
"You want them to be light and airy," she said, "and you want the edges to be really, really soft."
Throughout history, freckles have long been misunderstood and seen as imperfections. But there was a notable shift in the mid- to late 20th century, when a tan (and the accompanying freckles) became a status symbol of a life of leisure, said Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell, a fashion historian who specializes in the early modern period.
By the 1990s, freckles were associated with a more youthful appearance, thanks to the model Twiggy and the singer Jane Birkin, as well as the 1960s cultural movement "youthquake." In the early 2000s, they had become trendy on ad campaigns and runways. Then, in 2018, Meghan Markle's decision to go more natural for her wedding to Prince Harry led to a surge in imitation freckles.
In recent years, the rise of TikTok and the openness of influencers who are getting cosmetic work done have further bolstered procedures like freckle tattoos to a larger audience.
For Browstress, Krystal said, a majority of clients heard about the tattoos through word of mouth, web searches or social media.
Of course, not all press is positive. There are a number of posts of women sporting bright red, Pippi Longstocking-like dots right after the procedure, which some people can mistake for the final outcome. (Saki Lee, a Brooklyn-based artist who also offers the tattoos, said that was why she shared mainly images of the healed, finished results on her Instagram account.)
The worst of the inflammation typically subsides within 10 minutes, Ms. Lee said, though redness can last longer for people with fair skin. For many clients, their cheeks usually just look mildly sunburned immediately after the procedure.
At the end of the hour, Keila advised Ms. Sarre to stay out of the sun and not to exfoliate her face for five to seven days.
Oh, Krystal chimed in, one more thing: "Did Keila tell you that you can't work out for like three days?"
"You did not mention that," said Ms. Sarre, who, dressed in a sweat-wicking navy T-shirt, black leggings and Crocs, looked like she was on her way to do exactly that. "Why?"
"You'll sweat out the pigment," Krystal said.
After agreeing on a compromise -- she could work out, but not too hard, and the sauna was definitely off limits -- Ms. Sarre posed for some photos, admiring her new speckles.
The tattoos take about two weeks to heal and begin to lighten from a dark to a blondish brown after the first week, Keila said. Some may disappear completely.
"One to two will fall out," Keila said, "but we can add them back in."
The sisters often err on the side of going lighter before adding more freckles or darkening them as desired.
Has anyone ever asked to remove them?
"No," Krystal said. "In fact, people almost always want more."

Teaching Others the Art of Taxidermy: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: For Divya Anantharaman, who runs a taxidermy business in Brooklyn, regular manicures are part of the job.
Growing up in a cramped Miami apartment, Divya Anantharaman would spend hours perched by the kitchen window, gazing at the birds passing by.
Nature was mesmerizing, but zoo tickets were expensive, so Mx. Anantharaman, who uses the pronouns they and she, would frequent free museum days, gawking at the dioramas filled with creatures -- owls, elephants, tigers -- they'd never before seen in real life.
Mx. Anantharaman moved to New York City in 2001. A few years later, while working in fashion, they started taking taxidermy classes. The barrier to entry seemed high. "Taxidermy is a very homogeneous field. It's very, very white and very, very straight," they said. "I'm not either of those things."
They opened Gotham Taxidermy in 2015, determined to diversify the field. The business is based in a studio near Green-Wood Cemetery, where they offer workshops and create taxidermy pieces for private and corporate clients, including Tiffany-blue butterflies for a Tiffany & Company ad campaign and replica flamingos for the actors Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka.
Mx. Anantharaman sees the art form as a way to help people connect with nature, to experience "that moment of stillness, of vulnerability and enchantment" -- even in an urban environment.
Taxidermy "shows you that bodies are not fixed and finite -- they're very liminal," they said. "Bodies can really be whatever you want them to be." Mx. Anantharaman, 40, lives in Flatbush, Brooklyn, with their partner and four cats: Fugazi, Garfield, Mani and Junior.
MEOW I'm usually woken up by my cats before my alarm goes off. My tiniest cat, Mani, sleeps on the pillow next to my head. By 7:30 a.m., she starts stretching and wakes me up. It really sets the rhythm of the day.
SOMETHING SWEET I'm a fruit person, so I'll have a bowl of berries or mango or papaya, depending on the season. Sometimes I'll go for brunch in my neighborhood at Zanmi, a Haitian restaurant, or Purple Yam, which is Filipino fusion. I always get ukoy, this shrimp and vegetable fritter.
FOR THE VIEWS Green-Wood Cemetery is one of my all-time favorite places. I like going early because it's the best time for birding. You can walk up Battle Hill and see the tombstones opening up onto the city skyline. I love the simultaneous existence of all these things: the loud stuff and the quiet stuff, the green stuff and the gray stuff. It reminds me of why I love living in New York City.
TEACHING TAXIDERMY At least one weekend a month, I'll teach a taxidermy class in my studio in Greenwood. They're usually four people -- never too big. I want to give everyone attention. We'll make English sparrows or European starlings, butterflies or insect dioramas. Sometimes people are like, "It must suck that you work on the weekend." But it doesn't. Not when you're sharing something you love. It's really cool to give people that dose of nature in the city.
CITY CHICKS If I'm not doing taxidermy, Sunday is my go-to beach day. I volunteer with a group called NYC Plover Project on Fort Tilden and Breezy Point Tip beaches. We help protect the piping plover chicks because their first few weeks of life are so delicate. The best part is showing people the chicks through my binoculars, because a lot of people can't see them. They're the size of a cotton ball when they hatch. The average New Yorker probably has no idea that these endangered birds are nesting in the city.
ENDANGERED PLACES Afterward, I'll go to Riis Beach. It's only about a mile away from where the shorebirds nest, but it's so different. I remember the first time I went thinking it was so different from the beaches I had grown up with in Miami, where you had to look perfect and be wearing the right bathing suit. At Riis, I felt at home. The beach has been a beacon for the queer community for generations, but a lot of folks are worried about its future. An abandoned hospital is being demolished, and people are worried about what will replace it.
GLAM O'CLOCK Around 6 o'clock, I'll get my nails done. Sometimes I'll go to Noir, a small locally owned business in Flatbush. Or I'll go to The Pointed Nail, which is a really cool nail art studio in between Bed-Stuy and Williamsburg. People often think of anything that's "femme" as frivolous, but it's really not. It can be armor. My hands are such a big part of my livelihood, so getting that hand massage and pampering feels really important.
SUNDAY IS THE NEW SATURDAY Sunday is a fun night to go out because not a lot of people are out. There's a bar called Ginger's that's really cool -- it's one of the few queer women's spaces in New York City. There's also a place called Good Judy that has pretty fun drag shows. But I don't go out as much as I did when I was younger. In the colder months, I usually stay in, admiring my new nails. I'll eat an edible and order takeaway from Debe Kitchen, a roti place that specializes in Indo-Caribbean food.
BLUE NIGHTS I usually start winding down around 10:30 p.m. with a tea. I'm really into anything herbal. Chamomile is my go-to. Or butterfly pea flower -- it's blue and it makes me think of bedtime. The last thing I'll have is a CBD gummy. I'll give the cats a snack, get into bed and fall asleep.

Her Tailored Tours Make Paris a Perfect Fit: [Style Desk]

Full text: Anya Firestone leads what she calls "cou-tours" around Paris: Tours tailored to the clients' interests, be they dinosaurs, drag queens or booze.
On a recent morning at the Louvre, Anya Firestone handed out bottles of Evian. "Because 'the art of drinking' begins with hydration," she said.
Ms. Firestone, 34, a museum guide-conférencière (tour guide) and art integration strategist, wore rhinestone earrings in the shape of olive martinis, pink Manolo Blahniks, the Mini Bar clutch by Charlotte Olympia and a Marni dress printed with likenesses of Venus.
She escorted Matt Stanley, her client, and his Parisian date, Salomé Bes, 30, past the long lines at the museum's entrance and toward the Code of Hammurabi. The set of ancient Babylonian laws included "an eye for an eye," she explained, and it also dealt with issues of alcoholic beverages, like watered-down wine and the peoples' "right to beer," as she pithily put it.
"Pretty impressive!" said Mr. Stanley, the chief executive of a memory care community near Austin, Texas. Mr. Stanley, 43, had hired Ms. Firestone to design a two-day visit around alcohol.
"You're going to see that drinking and art had the same upbringing and moved in the same direction -- from a religious context with prayers and libations to decadence and debauchery," said Ms. Firestone, who calls her custom tours "cou-tours," a play on couture.
Last fall, Ms. Firestone starred in "The Real Girlfriends of Paris," a reality show broadcast on Bravo that followed six 20- and 30-something American women as they navigated work, life and l'amour. She said that the opportunity to put her business, called Maison Firestone, on public view was the main reason she had done the show.
But Ms. Firestone had also liked the idea of elevating the oft-scorned TV genre with art and culture. (Not to mention some pun- and Yiddish-inflected wit.) "By the way," she said, "I don't describe myself as American. I say I'm New-Yorkaise."
Ms. Firestone was raised in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood Manhattan; her parents were actors. She first moved to Paris in 2010 after college at George Washington University, for an artist residency, during which she wrote poetry and sculpted oversize macarons. (People thought they were colorful hamburgers," she said, explaining that the confection had not become popular yet.)
She worked briefly as an au pair, channeling Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp, she said. But Ms. Firestone likened her current plot to the TV shows "Emily in Paris" -- "Love her chutzpah, less her bucket hats," she said of the protagonist -- and "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
After a master's degree in French cultural studies from Columbia Global Center in Paris, she spent a few years traveling between New York and Paris, offering custom tours and writing about art and brand intersections for Highsnobiety. Maison Firestone -- which also designs themed events with luxury brands -- followed from that interest in "art as branding," she said.
At "Winged Victory of Samothrace," a white marble statue from Hellenistic Greece, better known as "Niké," for example, Ms. Firestone noted that the figure's wings had inspired the sportswear empire's Swoosh logo.
Ms. Firestone's clients used to find her only by word of mouth, but now about half of them, including Mr. Stanley, come to her via the Bravo show and Instagram. The majority are visiting France from the United States; the cost of a tour starts at $ 2,400 for one or two people for one day.
Her angle is to take "art off the wall to show its intersection with things that people already enjoy and consume," Ms. Firestone said, be it champagne or Schiaparelli or N.F.T.s. Recent and upcoming tours have been designed for drag queens, the crypto team at a venture capital firm, "Eloise-like" little girls with a fondness for dinosaurs, and a man who is blind.
Working her way through Dionysian art and decorative works, Louis XIV's stemware, and the occasional Bravo fan ("I just want to say that I loved the show!"), Ms. Firestone directed Mr. Stanley and Ms. Bes into the museum's largest room, where the Mona Lisa hangs on a wall across from "The Wedding Feast at Cana," an immense piece by the 16th-century artist Paolo Veronese that depicts Jesus Christ turning water into wine. "You can see wine tastings happening all over the painting," she said.
After lunch at the Ritz, which naturally featured cocktails and champagne, the itinerary called for the Musée d'Orsay. "The Louvre was a former palace, this is a former train station," Ms. Firestone said. She likes companion visits to the two museums, which, she said, help to show how art entered modernity by breaking from the monarchy, the church and the academy and spilling into the cafes of Paris.
"L'Absinthe" by Edgar Degas pictured what she called a "tapped out" woman with a glass of the infamous green spirit on a table before her. Nearby was a painting by Édouard Manet of the same woman (the actress Ellen Andrée), titled "Plum Brandy." Ms. Firestone prompted her clients to ponder the difference. "She's not nearly so sad or so schnockered here, right? She seems OK."
Paris, she said, had by then been transformed by Napoleon III's urban planner Georges-Eugène Haussmann, bringing with it grand department stores like Le Bon Marché and Samaritaine.
Ms. Firestone and Mr. Stanley met the next day at Samaritaine, where she had arranged for a cognac tasting and some shopping in the private apartments with a stylist. "Bonjour. How y'all doin'?" Mr. Stanley said, greeting the staff. "I'm not an aristocrat -- I'm just a cowboy!" He chose a pair of drawstring trousers by Maison Margiela.
Afterward, in a taxi, Ms. Firestone pointed at a Prada ad featuring Scarlett Johansson. "I think they're referencing that Man Ray photo of Kiki de Montparnasse," she said. "We like a good art-brand ref." She Googled the Man Ray photograph on her phone and held it up for Mr. Stanley to see, who said he felt like he had gotten a master class.
"Who doesn't love their hand held in Paris?" Ms. Firestone said.

Full text: These days, powerful men want to beat one another. Literally.
Call it the melee of the middle-aged men.
We already know the main event. That would be Elon Musk versus Mark Zuckerberg in Las Vegas, or maybe the Colosseum in Rome. The rival tech billionaires are inching toward a cage match, brokered by Dana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
And for an undercard, how about a sitting U.S. senator versus a union boss? Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, last week challenged Sean O'Brien, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, to a mixed martial arts fight after Mr. O'Brien called him a "clown" and a "fraud" on Twitter.
In case that's not enough testosterone, perhaps some feats of strength are in order. Robert Kennedy Jr. might be interested. The Democratic presidential candidate recently took his shirt off in Venice Beach to perform push-ups and incline bench presses -- revealing an uncommonly defined upper body for anyone, let alone a 69-year-old. (He has a full decade on Jeff Bezos, who is also musclebound.) So too might Jamaal Bowman. On Thursday, the Democratic representative of New York posted to Twitter a video of himself bench-pressing 405 pounds.
For some powerful men, this is a season for peacocking. No longer content to embody the masculine ideals of financial, professional and political achievement -- or simply to optimize their fitness, as tech chief executives have long done -- suddenly these honchos want us to see the achievements of their bodies. Grappling, squeezing, flexing, dominating (or being dominated): These are no longer tired metaphors for corporate or intellectual conquest. They are literal descriptions of America's big shots showing off as buff boys.
So, what's with all these conspicuous displays of machismo? To start, they're mostly just that -- displays.
"A lot of it is spectacle," said Andrew Reiner, a lecturer in men's studies at Towson University and the author of the book "Better Boys, Better Men: The New Masculinity That Creates Greater Courage and Emotional Resiliency." As Mr. Kennedy's viral lifting session proved, a bit of well-timed machismo is prime fodder for the social media machine.
But, according to Mr. Reiner, these look-at-me behaviors also draw on something deeper: tropes of masculine honor and personal strength that American pop culture has been broadly moving away from, but may be rediscovering.
"It's textbook, old-school, throwback masculinity," Mr. Reiner said, pointing to Will Smith's slap of Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars -- after Mr. Rock made a joke about Mr. Smith's wife, the actress Jada Pinkett Smith -- as a watershed moment.
One factor in the cage match moment is the increasing influence of mixed martial arts culture. Joe Rogan, a prominent fan of fights who holds a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu, reaches millions of people with his podcast, "The Joe Rogan Experience," on which Mr. Musk, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Zuckerberg have all appeared as guests. Mr. Mullin, the senator, had a short career as an M.M.A. fighter.
The Musk-Zuckerberg and Mullin-O'Brien back-and-forths recall the performative jawing of a boxing match weigh-in, and the athletic theater, or "kayfabe," of professional wrestling, where wrestlers play characters who never acknowledge there is a script.
This blend of reality and fantasy became a key feature of American public life during the Trump years, according to Abraham Josephine Riesman, the author of "Ringmaster: Vince McMahon and the Unmaking of America." The blurring of reality is key to understanding a world in which campy performances of heterosexual masculinity can seize our collective attention, Mx. Riesman said.
"There's something about committing to a totally outsized parody that just works for the human brain," she said.
Another common thread may be a measure of overcompensation. After being photographed shirtless last summer aboard a yacht (and subsequently ridiculed for his physique), Mr. Musk tweeted in October that he had been fasting and taking Wegovy, a prescription drug used to treat obesity. And although Mr. Zuckerberg, who is 5 feet 7 inches tall, is in fact a committed athlete, he has for years worn the title of nerd king, which he inherited from Bill Gates. (Recently, Mr. Zuckerberg has turned to training and competing in martial arts, and posting mirror selfies of his progress on Instagram.)
Meanwhile, for Mr. Kennedy, the shirtless romp draws a contrast with the Democratic front-runner, President Biden, who is 80 years old. "Getting in shape for my debates with President Biden!" Mr. Kennedy tweeted, alongside a video of himself doing push-ups.
The modern history of male politicians strutting and brawling dates back at least to Teddy Roosevelt in the early 1900s. Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president and himself a judo black belt, was photographed shirtless on horseback in 2009. And Paul Ryan, the former speaker of the House and onetime vice-presidential candidate, posed with 40-pound dumbbells for Time magazine ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
More recently, the muscular former Democratic congressman John Delaney spoke to the news media in 2019 about his fitness routine while running for president. (Mr. Mullin's bipartisan, CrossFit-inspired fitness routine was covered in The Times nearly a decade ago.)
Gary Meltz, a consultant who advises politicians and corporations on their image, said he thought Mr. Kennedy's attempt to seem younger and stronger than Mr. Biden misread the electorate.
"It's more akin to Putin sitting on top of a horse than something that will appeal to Democratic voters," Mr. Meltz said.
Of course, women in leadership positions face scrutiny over their appearance and affect in ways Mr. Musk and Mr. Kennedy never would. Imagine, for example, how a female C.E.O. who displayed Mr. Musk's apparent impulsiveness, aggression and vanity would be talked about.
"The margin with which women can display any kind of jealousy, resentment, ego, or desire to get ahead in any unfettered way is very narrow," said Samhita Mukhopadhyay, the co-editor of the anthology "Nasty Women: Feminism, Resistance, and Revolution in Trump's America" and the author of the forthcoming book "The Myth of Making It."
Then again, the times may be changing. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman and CrossFit aficionado who once shared a video of herself performing pull-ups and overhead presses, called her Republican colleague Lauren Boebert of Colorado a "little bitch" on the House floor last month. It was just the kind of barb one might expect before a cage match.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The barrier-breaking romance of a Pakistani woman and an Indian man has led to criminal charges and nationalist intrigue.
Their love affair across one of the world's most heavily guarded borders had begun on the virtual battlefields of a video game where players bond over having one another's back against bloody enemy ambushes to become the last survivors.
But when Seema Ghulam Haider, 27, a married Pakistani Muslim, sneaked into India with her four children to be with Sachin Meena, 22, a Hindu man, their time together was brief. About two months after they started secretly living in the same neighborhood in Rabupura, a town outside New Delhi, the couple ran into the Indian authorities.
This week, Ms. Haider and her children were arrested on charges of having illegally entered India; Mr. Meena and his father were also arrested, on charges that amount to little short of conspiring to shelter an enemy.
"I don't want to go back," Ms. Haider told reporters as she was taken away by the police, her befuddled children next to her. "I want to marry Sachin. I love him a lot. I left everything for him."
Mr. Meena also affirmed his love.
"We just want the government to let us marry and build a family," he said as he and his father were arrested.
Among the hurdles the lovers face, perhaps the biggest is the acrimony between their respective homelands.
India and neighboring Pakistan -- a country that was carved out of India in 1947 as the last act of British colonial rule -- have fought many wars. Tensions are so high that even suspicious pigeons crossing the border have ended up in detention on charges of spying. Getting a visa is a bit like winning a lottery.
And in both countries, interfaith relations have become a minefield.
In Pakistan, where Islamic extremism is entrenched, frequent reports emerge of girls from religious minorities, particularly Hindus, being married at a young age and forcibly converted to Islam, according to human rights groups.
In India, a powerful Hindu right-wing movement condemns any interfaith relationship between a Muslim and a Hindu, calling such unions an instance of "love jihad," or an attempt by Muslim men to pursue Hindu women with the intention of converting them to Islam. That accusation has become part of a larger and consistent demonization of the country's 200 million Muslims.
Ms. Haider and Mr. Meena met in 2019, in the virtual battlefields of the hugely popular game PUBG (pronounced pub-gee). They moved on to using Instagram and WhatsApp, among other media, in 2020.
"They both grew closer, so the desire to meet came up," the Indian police said in a statement chronicling their relationship.
Ms. Haider had been living in Karachi, where she had four children with her husband, Ghulam Haider, whom she married in 2014, according to the police and her father-in-law.
Ms. Haider's cross-border romance with Mr. Meena appears to have started after her husband, a laborer, moved to Saudi Arabia for a job.
"Sachin used to talk to someone late at night, as late as 2-3 a.m.," said Birbal Meena, his uncle, who lived with his nephew and extended family in a shared home in Rabupura, about 40 miles southeast of New Delhi.
Initially, the younger Mr. Meena deflected questions about his phone calls.
"Then he confessed that he was in love with a Pakistani woman and intended to marry her," his uncle said. "He also said that the woman had four children and her husband deserted her."
"We told him, how could he bring a woman from an enemy country?" the uncle said. "Sachin's grandfather begged him, 'Please don't do this."'
Nearly four years into their long-distance relationship, the couple met for the first time in March in Nepal. They stayed at a hotel for a week in Kathmandu; police officials said she had come without her children. She returned to Pakistan and he to India -- with the promise that they would reunite, using the porous border between India and Nepal.
How did they plan their route for Ms. Haider to finally make it to India, children in tow? By "searching on YouTube," both told reporters when they were arrested.
The second time Ms. Haider left for Nepal, in May, she brought her children -- and it was clear she had no intention of returning.
Unbeknown to her husband, who is still living in Saudi Arabia, Ms. Haider had sold her house to fund her trip, said Mir Jan Jhakrani, her father-in-law.
"Then I suddenly found the news on social media -- that the Indian government had arrested her," Mr. Jhakrani said.
The couple could face several years in prison, most likely followed by deportation for Ms. Haider and her children.
Police officials said their interrogation showed that Mr. Meena, who earned about $ 100 a month at a corner store, had not inflated his story or lured Ms. Haider with fake promises.
"She knew that he was not financially very strong," said Sudhir Kumar, the head of the Rabupura police station. "She was not impressed by his work, but by his PUBG skills."

A Cry for Help Finds a Beat and Becomes a Global Hit: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Nomcebo Zikode, the South African singer of the pandemic hit "Jerusalema" that inspired a global dance challenge, wrote the chorus while battling her own depression.
It starts with a clap, and then the feet tap along to the beat: four times on each side, followed by a quick jump. As the melody rises, dancers dip low and twirl.
It's a dance easy enough for anyone to learn, and people all around the world have done so, with everyone from an urban dance crew in Angola to Franciscan nuns in Europe showing off their moves on social media.
The "Jerusalema" dance, named for the South African hit song that inspired it, provided a moment of global joy during the lockdowns of the pandemic, a welcome distraction from the isolation and collective grief.
But it was the chorus, a lamentation over a heavy bass beat, that was balm to millions. Sung in a low alto in isiZulu, one of the official languages of South Africa, audiences didn't need to understand the song to be moved by it.
The singer Nomcebo Nkwanyana, who goes by Nomcebo Zikode professionally, drew on her own intense pain when she wrote it.
"Jerusalem is my home," she sang. "Guard me. Walk with me. Do not leave me here."
After more than decade as an overlooked backing vocalist, and with her faith in music faltering, Ms. Zikode, 37, was in a dark place in 2019 when she wrote those words.
Her manager, who is also her husband, insisted she write the lyrics to help her crowd out the voices in her head that were telling her to give up on music, and herself.
"As if there's a voice that says you must kill yourself," she said, describing her depression at the time. "I remember talking to myself saying, 'no, I can't kill myself. I've got my kids to raise. I can't, I can't do that."'
She didn't listen to the recording of the song until a day after it was made. As the bass began to reverberate through her car, everything went dark, she said, and she almost lost control of the vehicle. She pulled over, tears streaming down her face.
"Even if you don't believe it, this is my story," she said. "I heard the voice saying to me, 'Nomcebo, this is going to be a big song all over the world."'
And that prognostication soon proved true.
In February 2020, a group of dancers in Angola uploaded a video showing off their choreography to the song, and challenging others to outdo them. As lockdowns were enforced just weeks later, the song was shared around the world.
The global success of "Jerusalema" has taken Ms. Zikode on tour to Europe, the Caribbean and the United States. It also led to her being featured on the song "Bayethe," which would win the Grammy award for Best Global Music Performance earlier this year.
But while "Jerusalema" has brought her global renown, she has had to fight to earn any financial reward from it and to be recognized as part of its creative force.
She sued her record label, and a settlement in December called for her to receive a percentage of the song's royalties and to be allowed to audit the books of the label, Open Mic Productions, that owns the song.
At least as important, the agreement also states that Ms. Zikode must be cited as the song's "primary artist" alongside Kgaogelo Moagi, more commonly known as Master KG, the producer behind the instrumental track on "Jerusalema."
But even this victory in South Africa's male-dominated music industry comes with significant caveats: For one, Master KG is receiving a higher percentage of royalties. And Ms. Zikode said she has yet to see payment. "I'm still waiting for my money," she said.
Open Mic did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but in a statement put out after her Grammy win, the label said: "She is a very talented artist and we welcome this agreement as a progressive resolution."
Struggles with money are nothing new to her.
The youngest of four children born in a polygamous marriage, Ms. Zikode's father died when she was young and her mother, the third wife, was left destitute. Desperate, her mother let a church outside Hammarsdale, a small town in South Africa's eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, take her daughter in for four years.
There, she slept on bunk beds among rows of other children. She sewed her own clothes and helped to clean the dormitories. The church choir was a solace, but she sorely missed home until she was able to return in the 10th grade.
Her mother sold maize or bartered what vegetables she could grow for secondhand clothes. The neighbors who would ask the young Ms. Zikode to sing for them would feed her and take her in for a few nights as her mother struggled.
When she was old enough, Ms. Zikode learned to braid other people's hair to earn some money, but remembers self-consciously pressing her elbows to her side, for fear that her customers would smell that she could not afford deodorant.
But what she really wanted was to sing, and she got her break at an open-call audition. She spent years singing backup for gospel stars, sharing crowded apartments with other backing vocalists. When gigs dried up, she took computer classes as a career backup plan.
Ms Zikode's first major South African hit came in 2017 when she sang vocals on the song "Emazulwini" for a well-known house music producer and D.J., Frederick Ganyani Tshabalala. But what had seemed like a long-awaited break turned into a letdown when DJ Ganyani, as he is known, did all he could, she said, to prevent her from performing the song live on her own.
"They try by all means to suppress the singers," Ms. Zikode said of the D.J.s and producers who hold most of the power in South Africa's music industry.
DJ Ganyani did not respond to requests for comment.
Hoping a record label would better protect her rights, Ms. Zikode signed with Open Mic, but once the deal was inked, the label went quiet, she said, and she was left hustling to record her debut album.
Feeling abandoned by the record company, her husband and manager, Selwyn Fraser, sent messages to other artists, masquerading as his wife on Instagram and Twitter, trying to get bigger names to work with her.
This outreach campaign connected Ms. Zikode with Master KG and resulted in "Jerusalema."
It's not only the song that has made her a household name in South Africa, but also her very public fight for her royalties and recognition, in the courts and on social media, said Kgopolo Mphela, a South African entertainment commentator.
"She's coming across as the hero, or the underdog, taking on Goliath," Mr. Mphela said.
For all her struggles with reaping the monetary benefits of "Jerusalema," Ms. Zikode's musical career has made her financially comfortable and she now has a music publishing deal with a division of Sony Music.
Her 17-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son want for nothing, she said. She and her husband renovated their home, adding an in-house studio.
Ms. Zikode can also bask in the accolades that have come with her Grammy win for "Bayethe."
On a chilly April night in Johannesburg, in the Grammy's afterglow, Ms. Zikode stepped out of a borrowed Bentley at an event to celebrate South Africans who have achieved international success.
As she walked the red carpet, determined to own the moment, she granted every interview request, whether from the national broadcaster or a TikTok influencer. Later that night, she accepted two checks, one for herself and one for a charity she founded that helps impoverished young women.
When she took the stage to perform the song that made her famous, she hiked up her gown to dance the "Jerusalema."

As Donations Flag, Ukraine Troops Do Their Own Fund-Raising: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A robust fund-raising operation has been critical in supplying Ukraine's military. But as the war drags on, contributions have lagged.
Under the vaulted brick arches of a contemporary art center in central Kyiv, a soldier in military green gave a reading of his own poetry, far from the front lines of the war he has been fighting since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Like many other soldiers, Pavlo Vyshebaba, 37, a platoon commander with the 68th Brigade, had long been collecting donations to procure supplies for his unit, in his case using his poetry as an appeal.
But donations, which once flooded in via the web, have been lagging lately as the war drags on. Mr. Vyshebaba recently took two weeks off from the war to give readings around the country in a push to ramp up contributions in person.
"I saw that the fund-raising on the internet at the beginning of 2023 stopped being effective, that maybe my audience was exhausted and we didn't have victories for a long time," he said. "But we still needed all this stuff."
In the last two weeks, he has collected more than $ 100,000, which will go directly to supplying soldiers at the front lines he will return to days after this final poetry reading at a Kyiv book festival.
Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, many Ukrainian military units have relied heavily on donations and charitable funds to supply their troops with much-needed supplies like first aid kits, body armor, vehicles and even drones.
People and groups from around the world rallied to Ukraine's cause, providing valuable aid that could find its way to the front lines far more quickly than goods coming through often cumbersome government channels.
Sixteen months later, that enthusiasm seems to be waning, based on interviews with charities and soldiers who have been fund-raising. Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines say that donations now are less frequent, and that people seem to be moving on from the war, even though the conflict is just as tough and bloody as ever and casualties continue to mount.
This has left some soldiers trying to raise money on their own, often through unconventional means: selling paintings or memorabilia from the front lines, like pieces of downed Russian drones; offering to add personalized messages to artillery shells for a fee; and, in one case, a soldier raising money from a viral video he made of himself almost single-handedly repelling a Russian advance.
The wartime musings of Mr. Vyshebaba, who has written poetry since childhood, have proved popular. He has collected enough money so far for his brigade to buy drones, radios, Starlink communications devices and anti-drone weapons, among other supplies, he said.
"When large batches of drones, Starlinks, pickups began to arrive -- the guys from those units were coming to thank me or the commanders wrote to me," he said of earlier funding drives.
Now, though, in the back of the pickup truck of a supply sergeant, who withheld his name for security reasons, were the usual military armaments: an antitank guided missile launcher, rocket launchers and ammunition boxes.
But the weapons no longer worked and the boxes were empty. This once-lethal matériel, the sergeant explained, had a different purpose, headed not to the front lines but to the Salvador Dalí Academy of Contemporary Arts in downtown Kyiv. There, it would be decorated and auctioned off to raise money for his embattled brigade. He said he hoped that a celebrity like Bon Jovi would buy the missile launcher for an exorbitant fee.
"Most people are just tired of this war already," said Ruslan Zubariev, a soldier from the 92nd Mechanized Brigade, who became a one-man fund-raiser after he used a helmet camera to film himself stopping a Russian advance nearly alone. "Civilians don't realize that if they're tired and stop donating, it doesn't mean the war is over."
Mr. Zubariev, 21, was in a unique position in February after his video, which showed him killing several Russian soldiers and stopping an armored vehicle with a rocket launcher near the Russian-held town of Svatove, went viral. His unit, up to that point, had relied mostly on outside volunteers bringing in equipment. After uploading his video he gained thousands of Telegram and Instagram followers practically overnight.
So Mr. Zubariev monetized his battlefield valor, a move he saw as necessary since the military seemed unable to supply much of the equipment they needed to fight, he said in an interview.
"We repair cars, we repair equipment, we repair weapons. We repair this, this, this, this, this -- generators, fuel, all of it. It all breaks down," he said. "We don't get that stuff issued to us. We buy it all with our own money."
Fund-raisers typically buy the goods directly from suppliers, sometimes using intermediaries abroad. They can often bypass the slow bureaucracy and send them to specific units or soldiers, allowing them to be more nimble than the military's own distribution system.
Even the big, established charity and aid groups are struggling with flagging interest in the war effort. Oleh Karpenko, the deputy head of the Come Back Alive foundation, one of Ukraine's biggest donors to the military, said fund-raising was becoming more and more difficult.
Come Back Alive was the first charity in Ukraine that had a license to purchase military goods, including lethal weapons, directly from manufacturers.
Last year, the charity raised nearly $ 177 million and supported 580 military units with hundreds of vehicles, thousands of pieces of thermal imaging equipment, drones, radio stations and weapons, according to the organization's annual report.
Mr. Karpenko said that while they did not have figures yet for this year, they expect them to fall short of that mark, because of dwindling international interest and a more challenging landscape at home.
"The economic situation in the country is becoming more difficult as well, than it was a year ago," he said.
The charity communicates directly with troops to assess their needs and expedite supplies to them.
"The state is a big bureaucratic mechanism which moves very slowly, but some needs are super urgent. Our benefit is speed," he said. "We can procure without hundreds of approvals from 15 different offices. We can receive an agreement today, sign it and have a truck of machine guns in three weeks. The state cannot do this."
In the hallway of the foundation's new office on the outskirts of Kyiv, the remains of downed Russian drones sit wrapped in plastic, ready to be shipped to partners eager for a token from the front line, Mr. Karpenko said.
Smaller donors are also feeling the crunch. Les Yakymchuk, 30, has been collecting first aid kits since the start of the war with his charity, UA First Aid, but he said it had grown increasingly difficult to maintain interest.
"If you are fund-raising for a year, or more than a year, and you are talking about the same stuff in the same way, people start getting tired of this, tired of sending money," he said. His group has tried to revive interest in various ways, like sending tokens from the battlefield, such as flags signed by the members of a battalion.
He said many requests for supplies still came directly from soldiers hoping to bypass the often complicated logistics of official government channels.
"Everybody is still calling us," he said. "But this is war, and during the war nothing can be perfect."

RABUPURA, India — Their love affair across one of the world’s most heavily guarded borders had begun on the virtual battlefields of a video game where players bond over having one another’s back against bloody enemy ambushes to become the last survivors.
But when Seema Ghulam Haider, 27, a married Pakistani Muslim, sneaked into India with her four children to be with Sachin Meena, 22, a Hindu man, their time together was brief. About two months after they started secretly living in the same neighborhood outside New Delhi, the couple ran into the Indian authorities.
This week, Haider and her children were arrested on charges of having illegally entered India; Meena and his father were also arrested, on charges that amount to little short of conspiring to shelter an enemy.
“I don’t want to go back,” Haider told reporters as she was taken away by police, her befuddled children next to her. “I want to marry Sachin. I love him a lot. I left everything for him.”
Meena also affirmed his love.
“We just want the government to let us marry and build a family,” he said as he and his father were arrested.
Among the hurdles the lovers face, perhaps the biggest is the acrimony between their respective homelands.
India and neighboring Pakistan — a country that was carved out of India in 1947 as the last act of British colonial rule — have fought many wars. Tensions are so high that even suspicious pigeons crossing the border have ended up in detention on charges of spying. Getting a visa is a bit like winning a lottery.
And in both countries, interfaith relations have become a minefield.
In Pakistan, where Islamic extremism is entrenched, frequent reports emerge of girls from religious minorities, particularly Hindus, being married at a young age and forcibly converted to Islam, according to human rights groups.
In India, a powerful Hindu right-wing movement condemns any interfaith relationship between a Muslim and a Hindu, calling such unions an instance of “love jihad,” or an attempt by Muslim men to pursue Hindu women with the intention of converting them to Islam. That accusation has become part of a larger and consistent demonization of the country’s 200 million Muslims.
Haider and Meena met in 2019, in the virtual battlefields of the hugely popular game PUBG (pronounced pub-gee). They moved on to using Instagram and WhatsApp, among other media, in 2020.
“They both grew closer, so the desire to meet came up,” the Indian police said in a statement chronicling their relationship.
Haider had been living in Karachi, where she had four children with her husband, Ghulam Haider, whom she married in 2014, according to police and her father-in-law.
Haider’s cross-border romance with Meena appears to have started after her husband, a laborer, moved to Saudi Arabia for a job.
“Sachin used to talk to someone late at night, as late as 2-3 a.m.,” said Birbal Meena, his uncle, who lived with his nephew and extended family in a shared home in Rabupura, a town about 40 miles southeast of New Delhi.
Initially, the younger Meena deflected questions about his phone calls.
“Then he confessed that he was in love with a Pakistani woman and intended to marry her,” his uncle said. “He also said that the woman had four children and her husband deserted her.”
“We told him, how could he bring a woman from an enemy country?” the uncle said. “Sachin’s grandfather begged him, ‘Please don’t do this.’”
Nearly four years into their long-distance relationship, the couple met for the first time in March in Nepal. They stayed at a hotel for a week in Kathmandu; police officials said she had gone without her children. She returned to Pakistan and he to India — with the promise that they would reunite, using the porous border between India and Nepal.
How did they plan their route for Haider to finally make it to India, children in tow? By “searching on YouTube,” both told reporters when they were arrested.
The second time Haider left for Nepal, in May, she brought her children — and it was clear she had no intention of returning.
Unbeknown to her husband, who is still living in Saudi Arabia, Haider had sold her house to fund her trip, said Mir Jan Jhakrani, her father-in-law.
“Then I suddenly found the news on social media — that the Indian government had arrested her,” Jhakrani said.
The couple could face several years in prison, most likely followed by deportation for Haider and her children.
Police officials said their interrogation showed that Meena, who earned about $100 a month at a corner store, had not inflated his story or lured Haider with fake promises.
“She knew that he was not financially very strong,” said Sudhir Kumar, the head of the Rabupura police station. “She was not impressed by his work, but by his PUBG skills.”

Kennedy's Penchant For Misinformation Stretches Back Years: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A longtime vaccine skeptic, Mr. Kennedy is leaning heavily on misinformation as he mounts a long-shot 2024 campaign.
He has promoted a conspiracy theory that coronavirus vaccines were developed to control people via microchips. He has endorsed the false notion that antidepressants are linked to school shootings. And he has pushed the decades-old theory that the C.I.A. killed his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer, is a leading vaccine skeptic and purveyor of conspiracy theories who has leaned heavily on misinformation as he mounts his long-shot 2024 campaign for the Democratic nomination.
But as voters express discontentment at a likely rematch between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Kennedy has garnered as much as 20 percent of the vote in recent Democratic primary polling.
Mr. Biden and the Democratic National Committee have not publicly acknowledged Mr. Kennedy's candidacy and have declined to comment on his campaign. Nevertheless, the public scrutiny that accompanies a White House bid has highlighted other questionable beliefs and statements Mr. Kennedy has elevated over the years.
Here are five of the many baseless claims Mr. Kennedy has peddled on the campaign trail and beyond.
He has falsely linked vaccines to various medical conditions.
Mr. Kennedy has promoted many false, specious or unproven claims that center on public health and the pharmaceutical industry -- most notably, the scientifically discredited belief that childhood vaccines cause autism.
That notion has been rejected by more than a dozen peer-reviewed scientific studies across multiple countries. The National Academy of Medicine reviewed eight vaccines for children and adults and found that with rare exceptions, the vaccines are very safe, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Seen by many as the face of the vaccine resistance movement, Mr. Kennedy has asserted that he is "not anti-vaccine" and seeks to make vaccines more safe. But he has advertised misleading information about vaccine ingredients and circulated retracted studies linking vaccines to various medical conditions.
At a rally in Washington last year, he compared the vaccination records some called "vaccine passports" to life in Germany during the Holocaust, a statement he later apologized for. And he falsely told Louisiana lawmakers in 2021 that the coronavirus vaccine was the "deadliest vaccine ever made."
Children's Health Defense, an organization Mr. Kennedy originally founded as the World Mercury Project, has frequently campaigned against vaccines. Facebook and Instagram removed the group's accounts last year for espousing vaccine misinformation, and Mr. Kennedy has often lamented the perils of "censorship" in campaign speeches since.
He has made baseless claims about a connection between gender dysphoria and chemical exposure.
In an interview last month with Jordan Peterson, a conservative Canadian psychologist and public speaker, Mr. Kennedy falsely linked chemicals present in water sources to transgender identity.
"A lot of the problems we see in kids, particularly boys, it's probably underappreciated how much of that is coming from chemical exposures, including a lot of sexual dysphoria that we're seeing," he said. He referred to research on an herbicide, atrazine, in which scientists found that it "induces complete feminization and chemical castration" in certain frogs.
But no evidence exists to indicate that the chemical, typically used on farms to kill weeds, causes the same effects in humans, let alone gender dysphoria. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "Most people are not exposed to atrazine on a regular basis."
He has falsely linked antidepressants to school shootings.
Drawing on longstanding dubious claims, Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly endorsed the idea that mass shootings have increased because of heightened use of antidepressants.
"Kids always had access to guns, and there was no time in American history or human history where kids were going to schools and shooting their classmates," he told the comedian Bill Maher on a recent episode of the podcast, "Club Random With Bill Maher." "It really started happening conterminous with the introduction of these drugs, with Prozac and the other drugs."
While both antidepressant use and mass shooting occurrences have increased in the last several decades, the scientific community has found "no biological plausibility" to back a link between the two, according to Ragy Girgis, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University.
Antidepressants often have warnings that reference suicidal thoughts, Mr. Girgis said. But those warnings refer to the possibility that people who already experience suicidal ideation might share pre-existing beliefs aloud once they take the medicine as part of their treatment.
Mr. Kennedy, however, has pointed to such warnings as evidence of the false notion that the drugs might induce "homicidal tendencies."
Several high-profile figures, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have amplified similar claims following recent mass shootings.
Most school shooters were not prescribed with psychotropic medications before committing acts of violence, a 2019 study found. And even when they were, researchers wrote, "no direct or causal association was found."
He has bolstered a conspiracy theory that the C.I.A. assassinated his uncle.
Mr. Kennedy has long promoted a conspiracy theory that the C.I.A. killed his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.
He claimed, without evidence, during a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity in May that Allen W. Dulles, a C.I.A. director fired by President Kennedy, helped cover up evidence of the organization's involvement when he served on the Warren Commission, convened in 1963 to investigate the Kennedy assassination.
Referencing a House committee inquiry in 1976, he said: "Most of the people in that investigation believed it was the C.I.A. that was behind it because the evidence was so overwhelming to them."
But even that investigation, which found that President Kennedy was "probably" the victim of a conspiracy of some kind, flatly concluded that the C.I.A. was "not involved."
The Warren Commission found that the killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone and was not connected to any governmental agency.
And he has said that Republicans stole the 2004 presidential election.
Mr. Kennedy told The Washington Post in June that he still believed that John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, had won the 2004 presidential election.
Mr. Kennedy first promoted that idea in a 2006 article in Rolling Stone, asserting that Republicans had "mounted a massive, coordinated campaign to subvert the will of the people" and assure the re-election of President George W. Bush. He claimed that their efforts "prevented more than 350,000 voters in Ohio from casting ballots or having their votes counted."
But it is one thing to complain of vote suppression; it is another thing to demonstrate that Mr. Kerry won more of the votes cast.
Mr. Bush defeated Mr. Kerry by a margin of 35 electoral college votes nationally; he carried Ohio and its 20 electoral votes by more than 118,000 ballots.
The Times reported in 2004 that a glitch in an electronic Ohio voting machine added 3,893 votes to Mr. Bush's tally. That error was caught in preliminary vote counts, officials said. But the event, alongside other voting controversies nationwide, spurred widespread questions about election integrity that caught traction with people like Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Kerry, however, conceded the race a day after the election.

Latest Jobs Data Sends Wall St. in a Spin: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street fell Thursday after reports suggested the job market remained much more resilient than expected.
The S&P 500 lost 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gave up 0.8 percent.
While a sturdy labor market keeps the economy out of a long-feared recession, it could also push the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer in its campaign to defeat high inflation. That in turn could mean more pressure down the line on the economy and financial markets.
A report from ADP Research Institute suggested hiring by private employers was much stronger last month than economists expected, with nearly twice as many jobs created than forecast.
The ADP report can be volatile and "isn't necessarily a good predictor of the monthly jobs report" that is more comprehensive and due from the government on Friday, said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.
But it also paired with a separate report showing the number of workers applying for unemployment last week remained low relative to history, even if it was a bit higher than expected.
Other reports on Thursday offered a nuanced picture. One said employers advertised fewer job openings in May than expected. That could mean less upward pressure on inflation. A separate report meanwhile said growth in U.S. services industries remained hot and accelerated in June.
If the Friday jobs report is strong like the ADP report, it could mean counterintuitive pain for stocks because it would push the Fed to keep the brakes on the economy in hopes of getting inflation under wraps.
"Whether it's that big of a number" as what the ADP report suggested "or even half of that, it would still be showing that the labor market is very strong and the Fed has not done enough to get inflation down," said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.
"Even with some of this nuanced economic data, the bottom line is the labor market is always a lagging indicator" and later to crack under the weight of higher interest rates than other parts of the economy, she said. "We still expect the labor market to get weaker."
She expects a recession to hit within the next 12 months.
Yields jumped in the bond market as traders ramped up bets for the Fed to keep rates higher for longer than previously expected. Hopes for a potential cut to interest rates by early next year diminished.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.04 percent from 3.94 percent late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, climbed to 4.99 percent from 4.95 percent, back to where it was in early March, before the failures of several banks rattled confidence across financial markets.
On Wall Street, Exxon Mobil was one of the heaviest weights on the market after it tumbled 3.7 percent. It warned of a hit to its profit during the spring because of changes in gas prices and industry margins, among other items.
JetBlue Airways sank 7.2 percent after it said it will end a partnership with American Airlines in the northeastern United States after losing a court fight over the deal. JetBlue will focus instead on salvaging its proposed purchase of Spirit Airlines. American Airlines fell 2.4 percent.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, wavered between small gains and losses after unveiling its new app Threads, a rival to Twitter, which has had a bumpy ride under new owner Elon Musk. Meta ended the day down 0.8 percent.

Here to Help; How to Help Teens Cut Back on Social Media: [Personal Tech]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Public health experts have sounded alarms over the potential risks. But if you've already given your child full access, here's how to cut back.
Jason Mahr's eldest son was 13 years old when Mr. Mahr and his wife gave him access to social media, a decision the 44-year-old father of five regretted immediately.
It became "like an addiction," said Mr. Mahr, a student coach and former youth pastor who lives in Woodstock, Ga. His son was quickly swept up in seeking the approval of others online, Mr. Mahr said. He has since been more deliberate about how and when he lets his younger children start using social media, but backpedaling with his eldest has been difficult.
Recently, the warnings around teens' social media use have grown particularly loud, as both the U.S. surgeon general and the American Psychological Association have issued reports about the risk of harm to adolescents' mental health. Yet for many families, that ship has sailed. Survey results from Pew Research found that 95 percent of teens said they had access to a smartphone, while 35 percent said they were using at least one of the top five social media platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook) "almost constantly."
Jean Twenge, a psychologist who has spent years warning about the effects of social media on teenagers' mental health -- and a mother of teens herself -- said parents should "be confident in setting some reasonable limits," but empathized with how challenging that can feel, in the absence of better regulations for children on social media sites. "This is what so many parents are struggling with, and it's too bad we have to."
For those looking to walk back their teens' social media use, these three strategies can help.
1. Come up with boundaries together.
The American Academy of Pediatrics offers a free tool that can help you devise a family media plan, even if that is not something you've had as a family before.
"The problem is slightly different for each kid, so the solution will also look a little different," said Dr. Nina Vasan, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine and the founder and executive director of Brainstorm, Stanford's lab for mental health innovation. She has collaborated on a social media safety plan with her colleagues at Stanford that is under review for publication in an academic journal. The plan emphasizes the importance of making such decisions collaboratively.
Ask your child about what kinds of changes feel doable. For example, maybe your teen feels OK with paring down the number of platforms he or she uses. Or perhaps your children are more open to the idea of establishing a maximum amount of time they're allowed to spend every day on social media platforms, or on screens altogether.
Installing apps that allow parents to block certain websites and set time limits on devices can help you enforce these boundaries, according to the Stanford social media safety plan.
2. Propose a social media vacation.
Experts stress that social media is not inherently bad, and that it can help young people connect with others and express themselves. But it's also a good idea to talk to kids about the potentially harmful effects of too much social media, said Lisa Damour, a psychologist and frequent contributor to The New York Times.
If your child is showing signs of problematic social media use, you may consider instituting a complete break to recalibrate your child's behavior. For some teens, that recalibration might take a few weeks; for others, it might take a few months, Dr. Vasan said.
If that does not feel doable or necessary, you could have your teen abstain from social media use one day a week, and see how that goes. Parents can take a break, too, and talk to their teens about how they are coping, Dr. Vasan said. It may also help to get another family onboard: "For example, talk to the parents of your kids' closest friends and come to a collective agreement to help the kids simultaneously decrease their social media use," she said.
Expect pushback, added Dr. Vasan, who reiterated the importance of giving teens a sense of agency: "Tell them they need to cut down, but they can choose how they will cut down."
3. Hold firm around protecting sleep and other healthy habits.
Research has shown that teens who use smartphones around bedtime -- or who have a device in the bedroom overnight, but do not use it -- get less sleep and have poorer quality sleep than children with no access. Parents should explain to their children why smartphones cannot be in the bedroom, Dr. Twenge said.
Dr. Twenge recommends sticking with a consistent strategy, like having a charging station where all family members -- adults included -- keep their phone overnight. Parental controls that let parents simply turn their children's phones off overnight may not be appropriate for older teens who drive or frequently have sleepovers, she said, but they can be a good option for younger adolescents.
In general, parents should maintain firm boundaries around sleep, opportunities for physical activity and in-person socialization, Dr. Damour said, adding, "I think parents can say to teenagers: I'm not necessarily against technology. I am for the activities that we know are essential for healthy development."
As for Mr. Mahr, he and his wife apologized to their eldest son, telling him they made a mistake by giving him access to platforms he wasn't developmentally ready for. Now 21, their son has come to appreciate his parents' perspective, telling them he wishes he wasn't given access in the first place.

Michelle Wie West Takes One Last Swipe At the Brass Ring: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: You could see the head tilts and darting glances when people peered around Pebble Beach's Gallery Cafe, or as visitors sat on the patio that looks toward the cypress-guarded 18th green by Stillwater Cove. They surfaced at a luncheon with Brandi Chastain and Kristi Yamaguchi, and during a climb up a flight of stairs, and a stroll through a lobby.
That's Michelle Wie West, that 6-foot fixture of collective memory and modern golf history.
She did not win as much as she wanted to, and certainly not as much as many people thought she would or should have. But after close to a quarter of a century in the spotlight, she is still one of the savviest stars women's golf has ever had, a player plenty of people outside of golf know as a star even if they do not know golf.
The competitive golf part of Wie's life will most likely be done by dusk on Sunday, when the U.S. Women's Open is scheduled to finish at Pebble Beach. If things don't go well, and they might not since Wie West's husband will be her caddie for the first time and she has barely played lately, it could be over by dusk on Friday. After the Open, she has no plans to return to elite competition, though she dodges the word "retirement" in public (and confesses to sometimes using it in private).
She is 33.
That went fast, didn't it?
In 2000, when she was 10 and Bill Clinton was president, she played the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links Championship. She won the event when she was 13, the same age she made an L.P.G.A. tournament cut and had a turn in third place on a major tournament's weekend leaderboard. She played a PGA Tour event at 14, turned professional at 15, rattled off three top-five finishes in her first three majors as a pro, battled wrist trouble, won the Open at 24 and then spent years with more injuries, cuts and withdrawals than strong showings.
So it was not that fast, after all. Soon, though, it will apparently be finished. Barring a victory this weekend or a surprise in the years ahead, Wie West will finish with five L.P.G.A. Tour wins, including the 2014 Open at Pinehurst, tied for 69th on the career victory list. It adds up to a far better career than most players, though short of the mighty expectations that followed Wie West from the start and flowed from a blend of internet-age youth, talent, celebrity and marketability. (By way of comparison, Inbee Park, a 34-year-old player from South Korea, has won seven majors but has long drawn a fraction of the public attention that Wie West commanded.)
"What's the right word for this?" Wie West said in an interview in a sun-splashed lounge, well out of earshot of any aides.
"I feel very -- confident that I had the career that I wanted to," she continued eventually. "Obviously, I wish I could have done more as well. I think anyone and everyone thinks that."
But, she said, "the what-ifs and the regrets and the 'I wish I could have done this better' can drive you truly insane."
Even last year's announcement of a transition, to use her publicly preferred term, got derailed when her husband came down with Covid-19 and Wie West's parents stayed back to help with child care. Ready to detail the wind-down she had rolled out on Instagram the previous week, Wie West wound up nearly alone at the 2022 Open in North Carolina.
She had been mulling for years whether it was time to stop playing, frustrated by injuries and, more recently, torn by the notion of her family of three having only so much time together. In 2021, vulgar comments about Wie West by Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, jolted her into a fresh sense of purpose.
But there eventually came a point, she said, when she realized the game's toll was ultimately too high, when she feared her body would be so broken down she would not even be able to play a round for pleasure with her daughter. Her clubs have been in her bag almost exclusively ever since.
"It's hard," she said, "it's hard to know when the right time is to walk away."
That is assuredly in part because, for an athlete in any sport, stepping back from competition means the statistics are done and that the résumé is, with few exceptions, frozen. For Wie West, retiring or transitioning or whatever you want to call it meant firing up the inevitable debate about whether she had been a squandered or overhyped talent.
She hears it, of course. She also gets it.
"People love to chirp and have their own feeling and whatnot, and they totally have the right to it: They have been invested in my career," she said. "I know I haven't won as many as I, quote-unquote, should have."
At the same time, she seems to wonder how fair it is. She earned a degree from Stanford and won a U.S. Open, and those two feats, she figures, are what she wanted to do anyway.
And yet she can still run through all of the ways her career could have been different: if she had held onto a share of the lead at the 2005 Open at Cherry Hills, if her quest that year to earn a spot in the Masters had worked out, if she had made the cut at her first PGA Tour event instead of missing it by a stroke.
She is entering this week's 156-woman Open with measured expectations against a deep field.
The reigning champion, Minjee Lee, has won two majors since 2021 and is not ranked in the top-five in the world. And there is Rose Zhang, the 20-year-old Stanford student who last month won her debut tournament as a professional. Wie West's group, which will tee off at 8:28 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday, includes the three-time major winner In Gee Chun and Annika Sorenstam, who logged 10 major victories in her career and received a special exemption into this week's field.
This spring, Wie West was musing about how she needed to get her stamina up for the rigors of a major, how she needed to hone her iron and wedge play before returning to one of golf's biggest stages, especially since it will be played this year on one of the sport's most beloved courses.
"Just have to believe in myself, just get to a point where I feel confident that I can execute the shots and make the putts," she said. "And I'm hoping that it all comes very quickly."
She plans to remain closely connected to the sport -- she recently hosted the L.P.G.A. tournament that Zhang won -- but insisted that she does not think much about how she transformed perceptions of the game that she said still enchants her.
Even now, she said, she will play with her husband and become persuaded that, like every other golfer who has won, lost or never actually contested a major, she has unlocked the sport's mysteries.
"You get that one feeling and it feels really good, and you're like, 'I think I've figured out the game. I've figured it out!"' she said. "I still catch myself saying that almost every time I play, so I know there's an itch to want to get better."
Soon enough, after all of this time, it will be happening away from the spotlight.

After Rally, Wall Street Takes a Breather: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street edged lower Wednesday following a rally that had sent it roaring 16 percent higher for the year so far.
The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to drift lower from its highest level since April 2022. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.2 percent.
Other markets around the world fell more sharply after the latest discouraging signal from China's economy. Growth in China's services industry slowed by more than economists expected last month. It's the latest evidence that the world's second-largest economy is stumbling in its recovery following the removal of anti-Covid restrictions.
The U.S. economy has remained stronger than many investors feared, defying predictions for a recession because of a job market that has remained remarkably solid despite much higher interest rates meant to bring down inflation.
A report on Wednesday showed growth for U.S. factory orders held steady in May, although economists had expected to see an acceleration.
Hope is rising that inflation is cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to soon stop its interest rate increases, which undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy. At its last meeting, the Fed decided to hold rates steady, the first time in more than a year that it refrained from hiking rates.
Some Fed officials wanted to raise rates at that last meeting, according to minutes from the June meeting released Wednesday. The vote was unanimous, though, to hold the federal funds rate steady within a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, up from virtually zero early last year.
Much of Wall Street expects the Fed to raise rates later this month. Less certain is whether a second hike will hit by the end of the year, as the Fed has been hinting. In the end, that may not matter much, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
"The move from zero to 5 percent is all that matters," he said. "The Fed has either gone too far and damaged the economy, and we just haven't seen it yet, or they haven't.
"We'll see that in due time," he added, saying that one or two more increases of a quarter of a percentage point won't have that much of an impact by themselves.
That could leave the U.S. stock market stuck in a holding pattern as everyone waits to see if the long-predicted recession happens. The upcoming earnings reporting season could offer some clues, with companies telling investors how much profit they earned during the spring.
Mr. Mayfield said he is particularly interested to hear from companies that sell directly to consumers to see whether the main pillar holding up the U.S. economy is weakening at all.
Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.94 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, held steady at 4.94 percent.
On Wall Street, shares of UPS fell 2.1 percent as the company tried to reach a deal with the Teamsters union representing about 340,000 of its workers. Their current contract expires at the end of the month, and Teamsters members last month voted in favor of a strike authorization.
Companies that do a lot of business in the China region were also weak. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, which get significant chunks of revenue from Macau, both fell at least 4.6 percent.
On the winning side was Meta Platforms. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is poised to unveil a new app that appears to mimic Twitter. It rose 1.9 percent, adding to a stellar year where it has already soared 144.6 percent.
In stock markets abroad, indexes slumped 1.6 percent in Hong Kong and 0.7 percent in Shanghai after discouraging economic data from China.

Michelle Wie West Wants One More Crack at a Major

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — You could see the head tilts and darting glances when people peered around Pebble Beach's Gallery Cafe, or as visitors sat on the patio that looks toward the cypress-guarded 18th green by Stillwater Cove. They surfaced at a luncheon with Brandi Chastain and Kristi Yamaguchi, and during a climb up a flight of stairs, and a stroll through a lobby.
That’s Michelle Wie West , that 6-foot-1 fixture of collective memory and modern golf history.
She did not win as much as she wanted to, and certainly not as much as many people thought she would or should have. But after close to a quarter of a century in the spotlight, she is still one of the savviest stars women’s golf has ever had, a player plenty of people outside golf know as a star even if they do not know golf.
The competitive golf part of Wie West’s life will most likely be done by dusk on Sunday, when the U.S. Women’s Open is scheduled to finish at Pebble Beach. If things don’t go well — and they might not since her husband will be her caddie for the first time and she has barely played lately — it could be over by dusk on Friday. After the Open, she has no plans to return to elite competition, though she dodges the word “retirement” in public (and confesses to sometimes using it in private).
She is 33.
That went fast, didn’t it?
In 2000, when she was 10 and Bill Clinton was president, she played the U.S. Women’s Amateur Public Links Championship. She won the event when she was 13, the same age she made an LPGA tournament cut and had a turn in third place on a major tournament’s weekend leader board. She played a PGA Tour event at 14, turned professional at 15, rattled off three top-five finishes in her first three majors as a pro, battled wrist trouble, won the Open at 24 and then spent years with more injuries, cuts and withdrawals than strong showings.
So it was not that fast, after all. Soon, though, it will apparently be finished. Barring a victory this weekend or a surprise in the years ahead, Wie West will finish with five LPGA Tour wins, including the 2014 Open at Pinehurst, tied for 69th on the career victory list. It adds up to a far better career than most players, though short of the mighty expectations that followed Wie West from the start and flowed from a blend of internet-age youth, talent, celebrity and marketability. (By way of comparison, Inbee Park, a 34-year-old player from South Korea, has won seven majors but has long drawn a fraction of the public attention that Wie West commanded.)
“What’s the right word for this?” Wie West said in an interview in a sun-splashed lounge, well out of earshot of any aides.
“I feel very — confident that I had the career that I wanted to,” she continued eventually. “Obviously, I wish I could have done more as well. I think anyone and everyone thinks that.”
But, she said, “the what-ifs and the regrets and the ‘I wish I could have done this better’ can drive you truly insane.”
Even last year’s announcement of a transition, to use her publicly preferred term, got derailed when her husband came down with COVID-19 and Wie West’s parents stayed back to help with child care. Ready to detail the wind-down she had rolled out on Instagram the previous week, Wie West wound up nearly alone at the 2022 Open in North Carolina.
She had been mulling for years whether it was time to stop playing, frustrated by injuries and, more recently, torn by the notion of her family of three having only so much time together. In 2021, vulgar comments about Wie West by Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, jolted her into a fresh sense of purpose.
But there eventually came a point, she said, when she realized the game’s toll was ultimately too high, when she feared her body would be so broken down she would not even be able to play a round for pleasure with her daughter. Her clubs have been in her bag almost exclusively ever since.
“It’s hard,” she said, “it’s hard to know when the right time is to walk away.”
That is assuredly in part because, for an athlete in any sport, stepping back from competition means the statistics are done and that the résumé is, with few exceptions, frozen. For Wie West, retiring or transitioning or whatever you want to call it meant firing up the inevitable debate about whether she had been a squandered or overhyped talent.
She hears it, of course. She also gets it.
“People love to chirp and have their own feeling and whatnot, and they totally have the right to it: They have been invested in my career,” she said. “I know I haven’t won as many as I, quote-unquote, should have.”

Judge Restricts U.S. Pressuring Of Social Sites: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The order came in a lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, who claim the administration is trying to silence its critics.
A federal judge in Louisiana on Tuesday restricted the Biden administration from communicating with social media platforms about broad swaths of content online, a ruling that could curtail efforts to combat false and misleading narratives about the coronavirus pandemic and other issues.
The order, which could have significant First Amendment implications, is a major development in a fierce legal fight over the boundaries and limits of speech online.
It was a victory for Republicans who have often accused social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube of disproportionately taking down right-leaning content, sometimes in collaboration with government. Democrats say the platforms have failed to adequately police misinformation and hateful speech, leading to dangerous outcomes, including violence.
In the ruling, Judge Terry A. Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana said that parts of the government, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, could not talk to social media companies for "the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech."
In granting a preliminary injunction, Judge Doughty said that the agencies could not flag specific posts to the social media platforms or request reports about their efforts to take down content. The ruling said that the government could still notify the platforms about posts detailing crimes, national security threats or foreign attempts to influence elections.
"If the allegations made by plaintiffs are true, the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States' history," the judge said. "The plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits in establishing that the government has used its power to silence the opposition."
Courts are increasingly being forced to weigh in on such issues -- with the potential to upend decades of legal norms that have governed speech online.
The Republican attorneys general of Texas and Florida are defending first-of-their-kind state laws that bar internet platforms from taking down certain political content, and legal experts believe those cases may eventually reach the Supreme Court. The high court this year declined to limit a law that allows the platforms to escape legal liability for content that users post to the sites.
The ruling on Tuesday, in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri, is likely to be appealed by the Biden administration, but its impact could force government officials, including law enforcement agencies, to refrain from notifying the platforms of troublesome content.
Government officials have argued they do not have the authority to order posts or entire accounts removed, but federal agencies and the tech giants have long worked together to take action against illegal or harmful material, especially in cases involving child sexual abuse, human trafficking and other criminal activity. That has also included regular meetings to share information on the Islamic State and other terrorist groups.
The White House said the Justice Department was reviewing the ruling and evaluating its next steps.
"Our consistent view remains that social media platforms have a critical responsibility to take account of the effects their platforms are having on the American people, but make independent choices about the information they present," the White House said in a statement.
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment. Twitter did not have a comment, and Google did not respond to a request for comment.
Jeff Landry, the Louisiana attorney general, said in a statement that the judge's order was "historic." Missouri's attorney general, Andrew Bailey, hailed the ruling as a "huge win in the fight to defend our most fundamental freedoms." Both officials are Republican.
"What a way to celebrate Independence Day," Mr. Bailey said on Twitter.
The issue of the government's influence over social media has become increasingly partisan.
The Republican majority in the House has taken up the cause, smothering universities and think tanks that have studied the issue with onerous requests for information and subpoenas.
The judge's order bars government agencies from communicating with some of those outside groups, including the Election Integrity Partnership, the Virality Project and the Stanford Internet Observatory, in order to induce the removal of protected speech online. Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, which was involved in leading the two other projects, declined to comment.
Since acquiring Twitter last year, Elon Musk has echoed Republican arguments, releasing internal company documents to chosen journalists suggesting what they claimed was collusion between company and government officials. Though that remains far from proven, some of the documents Mr. Musk disclosed ended up in the lawsuit's arguments.
The defendants, the social media companies and experts who study disinformation have argued that there is no evidence of a systematic effort by the government to censor individuals in violation of the First Amendment. David Rand, an expert on misinformation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his understanding was that the government had at most a limited impact on how social media platforms engaged with misinformation.
At the same time, emails and text messages made public in the case that Judge Doughty ruled on have shown instances where officials complained to social media executives when influential users spread disinformation, especially involving the coronavirus pandemic.
The states said in their lawsuit that they had a "sovereign and proprietary interest in receiving free flow of information in public discourse on social-media platforms."
In addition to the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general, the case was brought by four other plaintiffs: Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, epidemiologists who questioned the government's handling of the pandemic; Aaron Kheriaty, a professor dismissed by the University of California, Irvine, for refusing to have a coronavirus vaccination; Jill Hines, a director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that has been accused of disinformation; and Jim Hoft, founder of Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site. The four additional plaintiffs said social media sites removed some of their posts.
Although the lawsuit named as defendants President Biden and dozens of officials in 11 government agencies, some of the instances cited took place during the Trump administration.
Judge Doughty, who was appointed to the federal court by President Donald J. Trump in 2017, has been sympathetic to conservative cases, having previously blocked the Biden administration's national vaccination mandate for health care workers and overturned its ban on new federal leases for oil and gas drilling.
He allowed the plaintiffs extensive discovery and depositions from prominent officials like Anthony S. Fauci, then the nation's top infectious disease expert, who told the plaintiffs' lawyers that he was not involved in any discussions to censor content online.
Some experts in First Amendment law and misinformation criticized the Tuesday ruling.
"It can't be that the government violates the First Amendment simply by engaging with the platforms about their content-moderation decisions and policies," said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. "If that's what the court is saying here, it's a pretty radical proposition that isn't supported by the case law."
Mr. Jaffer added that the government has to balance between calling out false speech without stepping into informal coercion that veers toward censorship. "Unfortunately Judge Doughty's order doesn't reflect a serious effort to reconcile the competing principles," he said.
Judge Doughty's ruling said the injunction would remain in place while proceedings in the lawsuit continued unless he or a higher court ruled differently.

E.U. Court Rejects Meta's Appeal on How It Harvests Users' Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The News
Meta's ability to harvest data about users in order to sell personalized ads was thrown into question on Tuesday after the European Union's highest court upheld a decision by German antitrust regulators that the company had abused its dominance in social media.
The ruling in the closely watched case by the European Court of Justice cleared the way for Germany's top antitrust enforcer, the Bundeskartellamt, to block Meta from combining data collected about users across its different platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as from outside websites and apps, unless it gets explicit permission from users.
The decision undercuts Meta's business model, which relies on selling targeted advertising based on the massive amounts of data it gathers about its users as they use Meta services and browse the wider internet.
Why It Matters: Emboldening tougher oversight of Big Tech
The decision provides fresh momentum for supporters of tougher regulation of the world's largest technology companies. Although the ruling applies only to Meta services in Germany, it is expected to influence other antitrust authorities in the European Union.
A new E.U. antitrust law, called the Digital Markets Act, takes effect in the coming months and gives regulators new powers to encourage competition in the tech sector.
In particular, Tuesday's court ruling gives authorities in the European Union a firmer legal basis to examine how data-collection practices could undercut competition, which is a new direction for antitrust enforcement.
The court said regulators investigating antitrust cases can also examine whether a company is breaking the European Union's data protection law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R.
Background: A new spin on antitrust law
In 2019, German regulators used a novel interpretation of antitrust law to determine that Meta's data-gathering practices were a violation of not just competition rules, but also the G.D.P.R. The authorities said Meta needed to get permission from users and could not just collect endless amounts of data simply because a user had signed up to use one of the company's services.
Andreas Mundt, Germany's top antitrust regulator, said Meta's policies amounted to a false choice, forcing people to either use Meta services and share their data, or stay off the company's ubiquitous social media sites altogether.
After the company appealed the decision, it eventually landed before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Mr. Mundt has long pushed for regulators to be tougher against Facebook and other tech giants. He has argued that Facebook uses the data it collects from users to strengthen its position over rivals, harming competition.
What's Next
In a statement, Meta said it was "evaluating the Court's decision and will have more to say in due course."
The company will now have to make changes in Germany to comply with the ruling. That is likely to include a new menu that gives users more choice about how their data is collected.
But the decision also has implications for other online platforms that collect large amounts of data for digital advertising, including Amazon, Google and TikTok.
"When large internet companies use the very personal data of consumers, this usage can also be deemed abusive under competition law," Mr. Mundt, the German antitrust regulator, said in a statement on Tuesday. "The judgment will have far-reaching effects on the business models used in the data economy."
Andreas Mundt, Germany's top antitrust regulator, championed a theory that weighs the accumulation of data as a form of anticompetitive behavior. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JANN HÖFER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B5.

Full text: The "oops, all French" edition.
Happy Independence Day! This is by far one of my favorite days to be in the city. The fireworks (both legal and illegal), the big "we outside" energy, the ample parking. You love to see it. So make the most of the holiday, even if it's just lazing around and catching up on "Love Island UK" to remind you why we wanted independence in the first place.
But today we're talking about this month's batch of reader questions. We have a query about where to take a son and brand-new son-in-law for a celebratory dinner in Brooklyn; another about lunch options near the Museum of Modern Art; and a reader who wants to know where to find a great baguette. Unintentionally, this newsletter is a bit French!
As always, please send your own questions or responses to wheretoeat@nytimes.com, and you may see them featured here.
A Brooklyn celebration
My son and his longtime partner surprised me with the wonderful news of their City Hall marriage last week! Since we didn't have a formal wedding or reception, I would like to surprise them with a celebratory dinner at someplace special. They are longtime residents of Brooklyn and always take me to delightful restaurants when I visit them from Georgia. My new son-in-law is a pescatarian, but my son has no restrictions. Please help, I don't know where to start. -- Paula R.
Paula, you're such a cool parent, and mazel! Here's wishing those crazy kids every happiness. If you want to really impress them with your sudden expertise in Brooklyn restaurants -- no need to credit me -- consider taking them to dinner at the aptly named Place des Fêtes, in Clinton Hill. There are good options for pescatarians: The chilled section of the menu is all seafood, including mussels en verde and sardine toast with smoked butter. (Halibut in brown butter for an entree?) And it's on one of my favorite streets in all of Brooklyn, Greene Avenue, which will make for a perfect post-dinner summertime walk.
A post-MoMA lunch
My school buddies are coming in from D.C. to visit and we are going to MoMA to see Georgia O'Keeffe. We are six and I always take them somewhere off the beaten path. What would you suggest for lunch? Believe it or not, we all eat anything! -- Madly W.
Do you have time for a very quick story? When I was in grad school, one of my professors took us to Le Bernardin to meet the chef Eric Ripert, who was really warm and friendly. Mr. Ripert recommended we head to La Bonne Soupe, on West 55th Street (and just two blocks north of MoMA), for lunch. So I'm going to pay his kindness forward and advise you to do the same, even if it's not exactly off the beaten path: It's an exceedingly charming French restaurant that isn't overly fussy, makes a mean French onion soup and croque madame, and its new owner hired a new, French-born chef to zhuzh the menu up without disturbing any of the charm that's made it a go-to lunch option since 1973.
Where do they keep the good baguettes?
Where in Manhattan can I buy French baguettes as good as those in France? Or, "ça n'existe pas?" -- Anthony L.
Bien sûr, we have great baguettes here! Downtown, I'd recommend checking out Le Fournil, in the East Village. It's run by Jean-François Hebert, a man with a name and a pedigree (Félix and Cafe du Soleil) you can trust. Uptown, you might consider Julien Boulangerie, home of New York's cube croissant, but also a very, very good baguette. They have three locations on the Upper East Side and one in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviews Raf's, a restaurant from the chefs of the Musket Room where "the cooking is so different it's often hard to believe the same person is in charge," he writes. The abundance at Raf's can be explained by the bread oven, where almost everything is cooked.
Openings: Adrienne's, a family restaurant named for a young chef who died last summer, brings tastes of Southern Italy to the Rockaways; Dan Kluger expands his Greywind businesses with a bakery near Hudson Yards; and MotherShuckers has opened a stand in the Pier 57 food hall.
This month, the influential Roscioli family, who run a small culinary empire in Rome, will open a location in SoHo, reports Julia Moskin. This first outpost for the business will bring their famous pastas, all Roman classics, to Manhattan.
"This is, like, puppies and rainbows." Amelia Nierenberg talks with chefs to learn what "The Bear" gets right -- and what it paints considerably rosier than reality -- about interning at a fine-dining restaurant.

Full text: Start small, look up and let your nose guide you.
I've loved doing the fieldwork for our monthlong series on walking. (You can find the previous installments here.) This week, we are livening up our walk by turning it into a microadventure, imbued with a sense of curiosity and exploration.
I tapped a few experts for inspiration and learned you don't need to go far for a little novelty. It's all in the approach.
Take a "scent walk."
Tejal Rao, the California restaurant critic at The Times, built a "personal smell museum" of Los Angeles, where she lives.
As Rao made her way through the city, she jotted down the aromas in a notebook. Her discoveries included the scent of frying onions from her neighbor's kitchen and the "sticky, piney aroma of sage bushes and rosemary."
I decided to take a "scent walk" with my best friend, Julie, who lives in Morningside Heights in New York City. As we walked with her Boston terrier, we detected notes of butter and vanilla wafting from a bakery, mulch from a community garden and a sewage scent from a puddle. (That last one was unpleasant for us, but Julie reminded me that "it's like Chanel No. 5" for her dog.)
Look for wildlife.
Every environment has a variety of living creatures, said Sgt. Rob Mastrianni, a park ranger in Manhattan, who recommended taking a walk with the express goal of spotting wildlife. He suggested turning over logs to see bugs and salamanders, and also remembering to look up. New York City, for example, is home to bald eagles, "but people won't realize there's an eagle circling above them," he said. You can use an app like the Merlin Bird ID to identify the birds you see.
Pattie Gonia, a drag queen and environmentalist who leads hikes as part of her mission to get marginalized people outdoors, pointed out that squirrels were surefire entertainment. "They're always in a war with each other," she said. "It's endless melodrama, like a tree version of the Kardashians."
Embrace the weather.
If there's a safe way to take a walk in the rain, wind or fog, "lean into the elements," said Rob Walker, the author of "The Art of Noticing," a book about finding opportunities to be amazed in everyday life. Revel in the dramatically shifting landscapes -- the drama of wind whipping through the trees, or the way that rain can make greenery look more vivid.
"I don't want to encourage anyone to go kick a football around in a hurricane," Walker said. "But we could all probably get, like, 10 percent braver about the weather."
Explore a new corner of your neighborhood.
There are likely things you've never noticed within a few miles of your home, Walker said. I followed his advice and discovered a park that I'd never visited. I've also found that cemeteries -- a blend of nature, architecture and history -- are a guaranteed microadventure. I've wandered among the headstones and speculated on whether the names Ebenezer or Euphronia will ever become popular again.
Many communities, Walker added, have an "informal neighborhood historian who loves to go on about the back story of this house or the secret history of that park." Use them as a resource, he said. I have a chatty neighbor who always stops me to talk about local lore (or gossip). So I proposed a walk, and he led me to a house that was part of the Underground Railroad.
If you live in a city, try organizing a food tour on foot, Pattie Gonia said. Grab a friend, walk for a while, stop and split a bite, and then walk some more. Who's going to say no to a taco walk?
To close out our walking series next week, I'll be talking to David Sedaris, author of "Happy-Go-Lucky" and a longtime walking enthusiast .
Fuel your microadventure walk with a trail mix recipe from Genevieve Ko.
Before you head out, whip up this easy salty-sweet trail mix created by Ko, an editor for New York Times Cooking. (You do need to subscribe to cook this recipe, along with the tens of thousands of others.) This version has minimal sugar, vinegar for tanginess and toasted nuts for zip. Perfect for an adventure walk.

The American Medical Association recommends doctors move beyond B.M.I. alone to assess weight and health.
Critics have long argued that body mass index, a medical screening tool, is an inaccurate measure of health. The A.M.A.'s new policy, adopted last week, could be a first step in moving away from a model of medicine that urges people above a certain B.M.I. to lose weight.

Chris Printup, 42, Whose Fashion Label Honored L.A.: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Printup said his brand was "like a love letter to the city that I once grew up in, that's gone now." He died from injuries sustained in a car accident.
Chris Printup, a founder of the streetwear brand Born X Raised, which became a fixture on the Los Angeles fashion scene, died on Wednesday morning at a hospital in Albuquerque. He was 42.
The cause was injuries from a car accident in Albuquerque on June 25, a representative of the brand said.
Mr. Printup, who was known as Spanto, founded Born X Raised with Alex Erdmann, who was known as 2Tone. The brand quickly drew the city's creative class to events like the Born X Raised Sadie Hawkins Winter Formal.
"Born X Raised is like a love letter to the city that I once grew up in, that's gone now," Mr. Printup said in an episode of "The Canvas: Los Angeles," a documentary series about the city's artists. "This is me. This is who I'll always be. And if you don't like it, we don't care."
Mr. Printup was born on June 6, 1981, in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles to Butch Mudbone of the Seneca Nation and Cheryl Printup of the White Mountain Apache Tribe. He said on "The Canvas" that he experienced poverty as a child, and that he cycled in and out of juvenile detention and worked as a drug dealer. Eventually, he said, he wound up in a supermax prison, where he decided to start Born X Raised.
The label, Mr. Printup said in the documentary -- part of which took place on the set of a commercial shoot -- was born out of the desire to "shine a light" on the Los Angeles of his childhood, especially Venice before it was gentrified, which he described as the antithesis of Tinseltown.
"I had an idea and a feeling and an emotion and I turned it into this," he said, adding that he had never studied clothing design or dreamed of visiting fashion events in Europe. "There was no plan, there was no business model."
He worked for a time as a craftsman in Local 33 of the sheet metal workers' union and started the brand, he said, as a "way to channel my frustration and anger." In 2013, he and Mr. Erdmann, his business partner, started selling the line at Union, a Los Angeles clothing store.
Shortly after introducing the brand, Mr. Printup received a cancer diagnosis. He underwent chemotherapy and lost 100 pounds and his hair, he wrote in a post on the brand's Instagram page in December. He worked all the way through the treatment.
"What I'm getting at is life is hard for everyone and I want anyone to know, that if you're feeling discouraged or like life has given you too many handicaps -- ITS OKAY. you're going to be fine things will get better," Mr. Printup said in the post, adding that he had gone into remission.
Mr. Erdmann described Mr. Printup in a phone interview as an "indefatigable" force of nature who was gregarious, and whom the people he worked with loved.
"Every second day he had breath to do things, he would," he said.
He said that Mr. Printup had been in Albuquerque for a traditional Native American ceremony, and that his father had died just two months earlier after a similar ceremony, also in a car accident.
He said, of Born X Raised: "We're not going to fold. We're not going to stop telling this story. We're just going to change how we do it, because we no longer have him." He added that the company would probably hold an event to honor Mr. Printup.
Mr. Printup, who lived in Los Angeles, is survived by his mother; his wife, Anna Printup; a daughter, Marilyn A. Printup; two sons, David R. Garcia and Carter Printup-Specht; three stepbrothers, Cai Printup, Casey Printup and Willie Mudbone; a stepsister, Zyanya Mudbone; and his stepmother, Caroline Mudbone.
On "The Canvas," Mr. Printup noted that had always been haunted by self-doubt, but that he had persisted through it. "When are they going to figure out that I am not good at this?" he said. "I think anybody intelligent questions themself."

At Least 2 Dead and 28 Wounded in Baltimore Shooting: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Frustrated officials sought information from the public about the shooting, which happened early on Sunday at a block party in the city's southern neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Frustrated Baltimore officials pleaded on Sunday with residents to come forward with information about a shooting at a crowded neighborhood block party that left two people dead and 28 others wounded, many of them teenagers.
A motive for the shooting, which was reported at 12:30 a.m. in Baltimore's southern neighborhood of Brooklyn, was unclear, but the authorities said there was more than one assailant. It was unclear whether the victims were targeted.
Officials said an 18-year-old woman, Aaliyah Gonzalez, was dead at the scene of the shooting, which happened at Brooklyn Homes, a public housing complex. A 20-year-old man, Kylis Fagbemi, was later pronounced dead at a hospital, the police said.
The victims were between 13 and 32 years old, the city's acting police commissioner, Col. Richard Worley, said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.
He said that the police were still confirming the ages of all of the victims, but that more than a dozen of them were under 18 years old. By Sunday afternoon, all but nine of the victims had been discharged from hospitals.
At the news conference, Brandon Scott, the city's mayor, called the shooting a "reckless, cowardly act." He cited footage of the shooting, which surfaced on social media, and criticized adults in the community who did not intervene.
He called for a "better level of accountability" and said the community should not condone "some grown man filming some young person pull out a gun." He said those who witness dangerous behavior should contact law enforcement authorities instead of posting videos "to get likes on Instagram."
Among those with nonfatal injuries were girls, ages 13 and 14, two 15-year-olds, three 16-year-olds and two 17-year-olds. Women injured were two 18-year-olds, three 19-year-olds, one 20-year-old, one 23-year-old and one 32-year-old.
Also injured were teenage boys, ages 13 and 15, two 16-year-olds and two 17-year-olds. There were also men with nonfatal injuries: three 18-year-olds, one 22-year-old and one 31-year-old.
Mr. Scott said that the shooting highlighted the need to address access to illegal guns and other factors that contribute to gun violence.
In 2022, Baltimore recorded more than 300 homicides for the eighth consecutive year, despite new initiatives by city officials. In the first half of 2023, there had been 138, according to The Baltimore Sun.
On Sunday afternoon, about two dozen officers and detectives remained at the scene of the shooting. Shell casings and debris from the party, which officials described as an unauthorized event that drew hundreds, still littered the streets from the night before.
The housing complex, with its squat brick buildings and maroon-colored front doors, has about 500 units for about 1,100 people. Amid all of the activity on Sunday, some residents peeked outside or sat on their front steps.
A councilwoman who represents the neighborhood, Phylicia Porter, said that the shooting was a "wake-up call" and asked community members to channel their anger into demands for "meaningful change."
"This incident represents a grave failure of our systems, and it is completely unacceptable," she said.
Larry Wallace, 60, a community activist who grew up a few blocks away from Brooklyn, said that the neighborhood was "really rough." He said he was concerned for the young people of Baltimore.
This year, there has been an increase in shootings involving children and teenagers, leading to an official city curfew for children 16 and younger. Alerts come to phones and through social media to remind residents that the city's youth need to be indoors by a certain time.
"The kids in this city need more to do," said Mr. Wallace, who has a teenage daughter.
The mayor's office said that in response to the shooting, it would put resources in the neighborhood "focused on addressing trauma and stabilizing the neighborhood in partnership with community-based organizations and city agencies."
The state's attorney, Ivan J. Bates, expressed outrage about the shooting on Twitter and extended "thoughts and prayers" to the victims and their families.
He added: "But we need more than thoughts and prayers; we need policy and change in Maryland, particularly in Baltimore. A policy that helps us hold repeat violent offenders accountable and reduces the number of illegal firearms in our communities."

At a Sonic Sphere, Trying to Step Up: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A hanging concert hall at the Shed in Manhattan purports to offer something "experimental, experiential and communal." Our critic climbs the stairs.
"Whoa," a man near me said as the curtains swept open.
He, I and a couple of hundred other people had been waiting in a large room at the Shed, the arts center at Hudson Yards in Manhattan. Portentous, woozy background music was playing, as if an alien encounter was imminent.
Then those curtains parted, and a much larger room was revealed: the Shed's vast McCourt space, in which a sphere, 65 feet in diameter and pocked like Swiss cheese, had been suspended from the faraway ceiling and bathed in red light.
This arresting -- indeed, "whoa"-inducing -- sight was the Sonic Sphere, a realization of a concert hall design by the brilliant, peerlessly loopy composer Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928-2007), who inspired Germany to build the first one for the 1970 World Exposition in Osaka, Japan.
Stockhausen, an impresario of electroacoustic experimentation and far-out notions like a string quartet playing inside a helicopter, imagined the audiences for his "Kugelauditorium" sitting on a sound-permeable level within the sphere, so that speakers could be placed under, as well as around and over, them.
During the six months that the Osaka exposition was open, hundreds of thousands of people came and heard taped music adapted for the in-the-round playback possibilities, as well as live performances. Then, for the next half century, the idea lay dormant; Carnegie Hall and Vienna's Musikverein remained intact, having not been replaced by giant spheres.
Enter, a few years ago, a team led by Ed Cooke (whose biography calls him "a multidisciplinary explorer of consciousness"), the sound designer Merijn Royaards and Nicholas Christie, the project's engineering director.
They have built Sonic Spheres in France, Britain, Mexico and the United States. Each time, like the plant in "Little Shop of Horrors," the contraption has grown. The Shed iteration, open through the end of July, is the first to hang in midair, at a cost of more than $ 2 million.
As in Osaka, some of the presentations offer taped music; some, live. On Saturday, I climbed the many steps to the sphere's entrance and reclined, like everyone else, in a comfortable hammock-like seat, listening to the seductively sullen 2009 debut album by the British band the xx. Forty-five minutes after that was over, the pianist Igor Levit appeared in person to perform, for a fresh audience, Morton Feldman's "Palais de Mari," from 1986.
Lights, in colors and configurations that tended to shift with the music's beat, played on the fabric skin of this big Wiffle ball. But for an audience that could be seeing the high-definition stadium shows of Beyoncé or Taylor Swift this summer, the visuals were blurry, rudimentary stuff; this was the aspect of the presentation that felt most trapped in 1970.
And the audio experience that emerged from the 124 speakers was unremarkable at best. The xx remix did nicely separate the bass, coming up palpably but not too heavily out of the bottom of the sphere, from the voices around and above. To no compelling end, though, and the album's whispery intimacy was supersized into a much blander grandeur.
The situation was more distressing for Levit. While the spare, spacious chords of "Palais de Mari" registered more or less cleanly, with only slight fuzz, the sound was muddy for the Bach chorale he played as a prelude; it was the perennial challenge of amplifying acoustic instruments, times 124. And the jittery lighting, a collaboration between Levit and the artist Rirkrit Tiravanija, could hardly have been more uncomprehending of Feldman's glacial austerity.
For all the souped-up spiffiness of the Sonic Sphere, the programming on Saturday felt like a retread of artists who were more interesting when Alex Poots, the Shed's artistic director, presented them during his stint at the Park Avenue Armory uptown.
There, in 2014, the xx did a celebrated (live) residency in front of only a few dozen people per show. Levit, the following year, played Bach as part of an ornate concentration exercise orchestrated by Marina Abramovic. (Will he, now a fixture of New York's more unconventional spaces, end up hanging upside-down at the piano once the Perelman Performing Arts Center opens this fall?)
Those Armory shows were more memorable than either Shed set. Both of them on Saturday were under 40 minutes, but I found myself getting antsy well before time was up. Perhaps the audiences at Burning Man, the techno-hippie hedonist bonanza in the Nevada desert where a Sonic Sphere was built last year, were more engrossed, experiencing it on harder drugs than the Coke Zero I'd had with dinner.
Sober, none of the music was more interesting, effective, illuminated or illuminating in this space than it would have been elsewhere. It was clear that the main point was that first reveal, as the curtains opened and everyone's phones came out, ready to post images of something big and glamorous on social media.
So, millions of dollars for Instagram bait -- but fine, if its creators didn't also hype it as "an unlimited instrument of empathy" that's "experimental, experiential and communal." I felt, in fact, more distant from my fellow audience members in the Sonic Sphere, even the ones reclining next to me, than I have at most any traditional concert hall.
In this, the sphere is of a piece with the other current offering at the Shed: a weird virtual-reality simulacrum of a solo piano concert by the composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died in March.
Empathy? Communal experience? No, the hologram-like specter of Sakamoto was more vivid and substantial than the other people watching with me, who, while I wore the VR glasses, faded into transparent ghostliness.
The wall text in the holding room for the Sonic Sphere acknowledges that technology can isolate us from each other, but adds that mustn't necessarily be the case: "We need it to delight and inspire us, not just passively, but in ways that provoke action."
But, as with so much ambitious, empty-headed, underwhelming, ultimately depressing tech, the action that's provoked by this expensive spectacle is merely a passing moment of "whoa."

Full text: A couple's efforts to use credit to book a new European trip was stymied by questionable customer service, until our columnist stepped in.
Dear Tripped Up,
In August 2020, we booked a trip to Iceland for $ 3,891 via Jetline Vacations, a deal we found through the email offers we signed up to receive through Travelzoo. Soon after, Iceland closed to foreign visitors, so we contacted Jetline to ask for our money back. We didn't hear from them for weeks, eventually filing a dispute with our credit card issuer. That seemed to jolt them, because then Jetline got back to us: They would give us a two-year credit. We ended up booking a trip to Portugal for April 2022, but were concerned when Jetline didn't send us confirmation details. We complained, waited weeks for a response and eventually were told we owed $ 800 dollars because of a fare increase. We refused to pay until we checked the documents, but when we did get them, it turned out the flight we were on had already been canceled. We informed Jetline, tried to book a third trip and encountered similar problems. We want our money back! Can you help? Meghan and Jay, Clifton, Va.
Dear Meghan and Jay,
The entire travel industry was shaken by the pandemic, so it is understandable that Jetline, a London-based travel agency with a strong online presence, would ignore your requests until your credit card issuer intervened and then refuse a refund, instead booking you another package, later raising the price and ignoring you for months at a time. Just kidding! This sounds awful.
I reached out to Jetline, which also goes by the more British name Jetline Holidays. Eventually I spoke to its head of operations, Richard Levy. He has refunded your money and asked me to offer you $ 200 credit toward another trip. (Update: You have declined in the strongest possible terms.)
"The most important thing is to make sure the client is satisfied, and I'm so sorry," he said in a phone call soon after he read your account, which I had forwarded to the company. "You know when your blood starts to boil? I'm thinking, 'Why didn't someone just nip this in the bud ages ago and keep a happy client?"' He told me that his customer service team had made some mistakes and needed some retraining.
To be fair, he called me back later with some convincing evidence that your story contains inaccuracies. For instance, he emailed me internal records that show Jetline did promptly send you reservation information, including the documentation for your flights and hotels, after you booked the Portugal trip. You later confirmed this.
Your story of a runaround from Jetline's customer service does ring true, however. My own blood had been boiling for five days as I tried to get answers from them, before finally reaching Mr. Levy. First, the website lists no customer service email, so I called their London number, telling a customer service agent named "Trevor" -- a pseudonym, he confirmed -- that I was a reporter. He told me he couldn't take calls from "lawyers" and directed me to send an email to an address he provided over the phone. I did, cc'ing several of the staff members you had interacted with in the documentation you sent me, including a manager named Rose.
Rose responded, writing that Jetline had "diligently made efforts to rebook the customer's trips" and continuing: "Unfortunately, it appears the customer has expressed reluctance in paying the price difference, despite our policy requiring customers to cover any additional costs incurred. We understand their concerns, and we are committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution." Her claim that the reservations manager had reached out "multiple times" to you conflicted with your account, so I wrote with several additional questions, cc'ing Steven Roberts, the company's managing director.
When that and a follow-up email went unanswered, I found another number for Jetline, posted online by a dissatisfied customer who had eventually gotten a refund. That led me to two more customer service agents, a lot of time on hold and eventually a third number that got me to someone who eventually passed me to Mr. Levy.
In that first conversation, Mr. Levy told me he had just been shown my original email. It had taken five days to get to him, and even that required some help -- from Travelzoo.
Travelzoo is a middleman, vetting travel deals and then posting them on its website as well as sending them to their members in promotional emails. (Companies pay for their offers to be included.)
I had written to Travelzoo since you mentioned you heard about the package tour there, and Rhea Saran, the company's global head of brand and content, got back to me quickly. She noted (as you had told me) that you had complained to Travelzoo in February. At the time, she added, Travelzoo had contacted Jetline and were told the matter was being resolved. But this time, she said a Travelzoo colleague got in touch with Mr. Roberts directly, and that's when the complaint got some traction. We compared notes, and it turns out that Travelzoo's contact with Jetline was less than an hour before I spoke to Mr. Levy. "Having learned now that a resolution had still not been reached," Ms. Saran wrote, "we're glad we were able to jump back in to help push it to a positive solution."
Problem solved. But the question, as it so often is in these columns, is whether your experience was a one-off problem, or is Jetline to be avoided, despite its attractively priced packages to Europe and beyond?
Ms. Saran said Travelzoo stands behind Jetline. "We have not received a significant number of complaints from members about them when compared to other travel companies," she wrote. "On the flip side, we have also received feedback from many members who were satisfied with trips booked through them."
But as you yourself noted, a lot of complaints about Jetline appear in online reviews, both old and new, as well as in some poor press coverage of them during the pandemic. It's hard to know how much stock to put in these -- despite my snark, things were chaotic in 2020 and 2021 -- and Jetline fares much better on Trustpilot, one of the sites Travelzoo monitors to evaluate the packages it promotes.
Which brings us back to a constant theme in this column: the nettlesome issue of middlemen. Unless they offer some clear advantage, advice is to book travel services directly through airlines, hotels and car rental companies. This practice can take a bit of extra time, yes, but saves considerable hassle when something goes wrong or plans change. My inbox is littered with countless versions of "I called Company A, and they said it was Company B's problem, but when I called Company B, they sent me back to Company A." (And that's when the companies are legit. Don't get me started on what happens when people book a flight through companies with names like UnbelievablyImpossiblyLowFares.com.)
But exceptions exist, and one of them is that online travel agents both large (say, Expedia) and small (Jetline) can put together packages that are not only convenient to book, but often cheaper than what you would pay if you booked everything separately. And local travel advisers can offer even more customization and valuable advice.
There are other times where you need to (or at least benefit from) using a middleman, say, when you use points to book a flight from your credit card's rewards site. But be aware: Every time you introduce another company into the reservation process, it could make everything more difficult when something goes wrong. And in travel, things go wrong a lot.
If you need advice about a best-laid travel plan that went awry, send an email to TrippedUp@nytimes.com.

Full text: Talks over a matchup between the two tech billionaires have progressed and the parameters of an event are taking shape.
The day after Elon Musk challenged Mark Zuckerberg on social media to "a cage match" last month, Dana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, received a text.
It was from Mr. Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta. He asked Mr. White, who heads the world's premier mixed martial arts competition, which is fought in cage-like rings, if Mr. Musk was serious about a fight.
Mr. White called Mr. Musk, who runs Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX, and confirmed that he was willing to throw down. Mr. White then relayed that to Mr. Zuckerberg. In response, Mr. Zuckerberg posted on Instagram: "Send Me Location," a reference to the catchphrase of Khabib Nurmagomedov, one of the U.F.C.'s most decorated athletes.
Since then, Mr. White said, he has talked to the tech billionaires separately every night to organize the showdown. On Tuesday, he said, he was "on the phone with those two until 12:45 in the morning." He added, "They both want to do it."
If you thought that a cage fight between two of the world's richest men was just a far-fetched social media stunt, think again.
Over the past 10 days, Mr. White said he, Mr. Musk and Mr. Zuckerberg -- aided by advisers -- have negotiated behind the scenes and are inching toward physical combat. While there are no guarantees a match will happen, the broad contours of an event are taking shape, said Mr. White and three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The fight would be an exhibition match, Mr. White said, and outside official U.F.C. jurisdiction and rights deals, though he would help produce the event. The tech leaders have agreed there should be a charity component, Mr. White and a person familiar with the talks said, with details still being worked out. The preferred location is Las Vegas, which requires approval from the Nevada Athletic Commission. On Thursday, Mr. Musk tweeted that the event could also happen in the Roman Colosseum.
Mr. Zuckerberg's friends and advisers have generally supported the match, two people close to him said, though others said a fight would be a distraction and not the best use of his time. One person close to Mr. Musk said that while he hated sports and didn't appear to have the discipline to train regularly, no one could rule anything out with him.
If the matchup between Mr. Musk, 52, and Mr. Zuckerberg, 39, goes ahead, it would be a rare spectacle, even in the braggadocio-filled universe of the tech industry. While Steve Jobs and Bill Gates used to snipe at each other, the closest the tech world had before this to real sporting feuds was among billionaire yachtsmen like Larry Ellison of Oracle and Hasso Plattner of SAP.
But two wildly wealthy tech titans grappling, punching and kicking in a Las Vegas or Roman arena? No one would have dreamed it.
Meta declined to comment. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Musk have long teetered between being competitors, frenemies and outright enemies. The two have criticized each other over the years, including about Mr. Musk's SpaceX rockets, data privacy scandals at Meta and more. Most recently, Mr. Zuckerberg dispatched a team at Meta to build a competitor to Mr. Musk's Twitter, code-named Project 92.
If they take their rivalry beyond those jibes, the U.F.C.'s Mr. White said he had concerns about the physical gaps between the billionaires. Apart from their 13-year age difference, Mr. Musk is said to be at least 70 pounds heavier than Mr. Zuckerberg. In official mixed martial arts bouts, athletes are generally matched up by weight.
"We have two guys that have never professionally fought, and they're in two completely different weight classes," Mr. White said. Still, he said, "it will be the biggest fight in the history of combat sports."
Mr. Zuckerberg is especially familiar with the U.F.C. world. Over the past 18 months, he has embarked on a personal journey to bulk up and dove deep into Brazilian jujitsu, a grappling martial art in which competitors try to submit their opponent and which is used in U.F.C. fighting.
Mr. Zuckerberg started training on a lark mostly in his garage in 2021, where he built what he called a "mini academy" with a circle of friends who spar with him. He has said he appreciated that Brazilian jujitsu required "100 percent focus" and strategic thinking to defeat an opponent, rather than brute strength.
Mr. Zuckerberg has sought out martial arts experts, including Dave Camarillo, James Terry and Khai Wu. In May, he competed in his first public martial arts tournament in Redwood City, Calif., which he attended undercover -- up until the moment he took off his hat and sunglasses to fight. He won gold and silver medals in the challenge.
Last year, Meta also announced it had partnered with the U.F.C. to bring mixed martial arts fights to Horizon Worlds, its virtual reality app.
Mr. White said Mr. Zuckerberg was truly dedicated to the sport.
"I've been talking to Zuckerberg now for maybe close to two years now," he said. "And there's never like banter or we're joking and laughing." He said the Meta chief executive was "dead serious all the time."
Mr. Zuckerberg is likely in fighting shape. He has been on a strict workout regimen, going for runs and challenging friends and colleagues to beat his times, two people close to him said. Last month, he posted a personal record for completing the "Murph" challenge, which requires completing a series of pull-ups, push-ups, running multiple miles and doing hundreds of squats, all while wearing weighted, military-grade body armor.
"Doing sports that basically require your full attention, I think, is really important to my mental health and the way to stay focused on everything I'm doing," he said in a recent podcast episode.
Mr. Musk, on the other hand, has tweeted that he "almost never" works out and once suffered a back injury that required surgery after participating in an exhibition with a sumo wrestler. Last month, he said he had trained in "judo, Kyokushin (full contact)" -- two Japanese martial arts -- and "no rules streetfighting."
"He made that very clear: 'I'm not going to lose any weight,"' Mr. White said of Mr. Musk's approach to the potential matchup. "'Are we going to fight or are we not going to fight?"' Mr. White said Mr. Musk told him.
This week, Lex Fridman, a podcaster, posted photos of himself training judo with Mr. Musk. Mr. Fridman, who has also trained jujitsu with Mr. Zuckerberg, did not respond to a request for comment.
At least one person does not appear to be a fan of a fight: Maye Musk, Mr. Musk's mother.
"Don't encourage this match!" she recently tweeted, along with two frowning emojis.

Full text: Toddrick Brockington, who works at the Henry Street Settlement, tends to his mental health and his sneaker collection.
Before Toddrick Brockington got his job at the Henry Street Settlement, a nonprofit that supports Lower East Side residents, he served 26 years in prison for homicide. The irreversibility of that act troubles him still. It also keeps him mindful. "I appreciate life more, and when I say that, I don't mean specifically my life," he said, "I mean other people's lives."
He brings that appreciation to work every day at Henry Street, where he started the Mentoring and Nurturing ("M.A.N.") program to steer teenage boys away from trouble and help them envision a future with fewer struggles. Mr. Brockington, 52, lives alone in the West Farms neighborhood of the Bronx.
QUIET START I wake up between 4 and 4:30 a.m. Sometimes I lay there; sometimes I stand in the window and look out and try to orient myself for the day. One of my views is, I think, facing La Guardia Airport. I can see the lights there, the trains passing. It's really beautiful when it's dark out. That's a peaceful time for me, because it's like I'm the only one up and I have the world to myself. I burn some candles. I'm a strong believer in setting the tone for my day.
CONTINUING EDUCATION When it's light out, I read. I'm in the process of reading "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell for the third time. It's almost like I'm studying it now. When I went to prison, I didn't have a G.E.D., so I obtained my G.E.D. and then a bachelor's degree in behavioral science. Reading helped me express myself better. One of the things I realized as I educated myself was that I hadn't felt comfortable around educated people, and that nurtured the belief in me that "OK, you're better off over here, away from educated people." There's a book I like to give the young brothers at Henry Street called "As a Man Thinketh" by James Allen. We discuss how our thoughts determine our behavior, as well as the idea that we must be mindful of the seeds, or thoughts, we plant in our minds and those we allow others to plant.
APPOINTMENT TV I don't really start tasking on Sunday until after nine o'clock, when my favorite show comes on. It's "CBS Sunday Morning." Jane Pauley is hosting it now. It reminds me of Reader's Digest on TV. The segments could be about anything: about the most beautiful places in the world, about people that change the world.
PINE-SOL AND A PLAYLIST On Sundays, I do meal prep. If I'm cooking rice or something that takes a long time, I'll do that, and then I'll start light cleaning, like dusting. I play my R&B oldies: Curtis Mayfield; Willie Hutch; Earth, Wind & Fire. It's nostalgia. The music and the Pine-Sol take me back to being a kid and having my parents cleaning. I grew up in Brownsville and left Brooklyn in 1981. It was in 1982 or '83 that I started swinging toward the bad side, when I moved upstate, to Rochester.
MORNING SQUEEZE Breakfast has never been a big thing of mine, so now what I do is I have a juicer. I'm obsessed with it. I get my fruit, throw my vegan protein in there -- I'm vegan, so I have to be mindful of certain things I'm not getting in my diet -- and, of course, I take my vitamins, and that usually holds me down. Sometimes cooking, cleaning and laundering could be my whole day. Cleaning has always been therapeutic. And when you throw in the candles and the music, it's almost like I'm at a spa.
ENERGY ABSORPTION If I do venture out on a Sunday, one of my favorite pastimes is driving down the West Side Highway. You see the Jersey side, and in my mind it's like the South of France or something. Sometimes I park. They have a spot, the 96th Street exit, where you can pull off and sit by the water. You can sit there and just zone out. I don't even take my headphones. I just absorb the energy. It helps me stay focused and grounded.
TRUCK CHASE I'm a big foodie. One of my favorite vegan food trucks is Black Rican Vegan, so I chase them around the city a lot if I'm out. Or I'll just find something new on Google Places. I turned vegan for my 36th birthday. That was a big gift to me because I had recently read that veganism extends your life. I was still incarcerated at the time, so I thought I could use an extra few years.
REFURBISHING I love sneakers. I'm like a kid with them. I probably have like 80 pairs, and I like to clean them. I call it refurbishing. When the young brothers at Henry Street see me wearing these sneakers, I'm quick to tell them that these are a last-thing purchase, because I have to pay for so many other things, like rent and car.
NICE IS DOPE Henry Street works with New York City's Summer Youth Employment Program. Recently I was out there trying to get kids to sign up, and a lot of them were like, "No, I don't want to work." But they're wearing $ 300 sneakers and $ 400 sweatsuits. In a lot of instances, that's due to a parent that didn't have much. The parent's mentality is, "I'm going to give you what I didn't have," but it should be, "I'm going to teach you what I didn't know." I always share this story with the young brothers about values: When I was a kid, I saw kids with nicer things than I had, and I automatically equated that with them being a nice person. So I set out to acquire nice things so people would like me, as opposed to setting out to be a better person. It's cool to have nice things, but it's even doper to be a nice person.
WRITE BRAINED I take my clothes out for work and get my food ready, have it bagged up for the next day. Then I sit in my room in my comfortable chair. Sometimes I'll write curriculums. I try to get to bed by midnight. I think when I lay down, that's when my brain works the most. You ever heard some people say they write in their sleep? I think that's me. I can't really relax. I guess that's anxiety.

Cambodian Ruler's Facebook Goes Dark After Meta Spat: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prime Minister Hun Sen, an avid user of the platform, had vowed to delete his account after Meta's oversight board said he had used it to threaten political violence.
The usually very active Facebook account for Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia appeared to have been deleted on Friday, a day after the oversight board for Meta, Facebook's parent company, recommended that he be suspended from the platform for threatening political opponents with violence.
The showdown pits the social media behemoth against one of Asia's longest-ruling autocrats.
Mr. Hun Sen, 70, has ruled Cambodia since 1985 and maintained power partly by silencing his critics. He is a staunch ally of China, a country whose support comes free of American-style admonishments on the value of human rights and democratic institutions.
A note Friday on Mr. Hun Sen's account, which had about 14 million followers, said that its content "isn't available right now." It was not immediately clear if Mr. Hun Sen had preemptively deleted it, as he had vowed to do in a post late Thursday on Telegram, a social media platform where he has a much smaller following. A Meta spokesman said on Friday that the company had not suspended or otherwise removed Mr. Hun Sen's Facebook account.
"That he stopped using Facebook is his private right," Phay Siphan, a spokesman for the Cambodian government, told The New York Times on Friday. "Other Cambodians use it, and that's their right."
The company-appointed oversight board for Meta had on Thursday recommended a minimum six-month suspension of Mr. Hun Sen's accounts on Facebook and Instagram, which Meta also owns. The board also said that one of Mr. Hun Sen's Facebook videos had violated Meta's rules on "violence and incitement" and should be taken down.
In the video, Mr. Hun Sen delivered a speech in which he responded to allegations of vote-stealing by calling on his political opponents to choose between the legal system and "a bat."
"If you say that's freedom of expression, I will also express my freedom by sending people to your place and home," Mr. Hun Sen said in the speech, according to Meta.
Meta had previously decided to keep the video online under a policy that allows the platform to allow content that violates Facebook's community standards on the grounds that it is newsworthy and in the public interest. But the oversight board said on Thursday that it was overturning the decision, calling it "incorrect."
The board added that its recommendation to suspend Mr. Hun Sen's accounts for at least six months was justified given the severity of the violation and his "history of committing human rights violations and intimidating political opponents, and his strategic use of social media to amplify such threats."
Meta later said in a statement that it would remove the offending video to comply with the board's decision. The company also said that it would respond to the suspension recommendation after analyzing it.
Critics of Facebook have long said that the platform can undermine democracy, promote violence and help politicians unfairly target their critics, particularly in countries with weak institutions.
Mr. Hun Sen has spent years cracking down on the news media and political opposition in an effort to consolidate his grip on power. In February, he ordered the shutdown of one of the country's last independent news outlets, saying he did not like its coverage of his son and presumed successor, Lt. Gen. Hun Manet.
Under Mr. Hun Sen, the government has also pushed for more government surveillance of the internet, a move that rights groups say makes it even easier for the authorities to monitor and punish online content.
Mr. Hun Sen's large Facebook following may overstate his actual support. In 2018, one of his most prominent political opponents, Sam Rainsy, argued in a California court that the prime minister used so-called click farms to accumulate millions of counterfeit followers.
Mr. Sam Rainsy, who lives in exile, also argued that Mr. Hun Sen had used Facebook to spread false news stories and death threats directed at political opponents. The court later denied his request that Facebook be compelled to release records of advertising purchases by Mr. Hun Sen and his allies.
In 2017, an opposition political party that Mr. Sam Rainsy had led, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was dissolved by the country's highest court. More recently, the Cambodian authorities have disqualified other opposition parties from running in a general election next month.
At a public event in Cambodia on Friday, Mr. Hun Sen said that his political opponents outside the country were surely happy with his decision to quit Facebook.
"You have to be aware that if I order Facebook to be shut down in Cambodia, it will strongly affect you," he added, speaking at an event for garment workers ahead of the general election. "But this is not the path that I choose."

Retailers Are Awash in Bud Light As Right-Wing Boycott Takes Toll: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The brand is still struggling to win back customers. Nowhere is that more apparent than at stores, where cases of the beer sit untouched.
On a recent steamy Sunday afternoon, customers strolled through the aisles of Glenn Miller's Beer & Soda Warehouse, where overhead fans circulated the hot air.
People heading to picnics, graduation parties and other get-togethers in Lemoyne, a Pennsylvania community just across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg, breezed into the store, passing myriad displays of beers, with cases of top brands stacked high.
Next to 30-packs of Miller Lite, on sale for $ 24.99, sat a stack of Bud Light. A large banner above it noted that, after a rebate, a 30-pack cost a mere $ 8.99.
Andy Wagner, the manager and an 18-year veteran of the store, said the Miller Lite was selling well. And the Bud Light? Not so much.
"At this point, it's cheaper than some of the cases of water we're selling in the back," Mr. Wagner said, noting that sales of Bud Light at the store since mid-April were down 45 percent from a year ago. "It's just not moving like it used to."
Nearly three months after the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney posted a video on her Instagram account to promote a Bud Light contest, setting off online outrage from the right and a boycott, the beer brand is still struggling to win back loyal, longtime customers.
For more than two decades, Bud Light was the best-selling beer in the United States. Its sales exceeded $ 5 billion last year, roughly 9 percent of Anheuser-Busch InBev's revenue. But since the boycott, Bud Light has been dethroned by Modelo Especial. In the four weeks that ended in mid-June, the volume of Bud Light sold nationally plunged an average of 29 percent from a year earlier, according to data from the research firm NIQ, analyzed by the consulting firm Bump Williams.
Anheuser-Busch's stock has also dropped more than 15 percent since early April. The company did not respond to a request for comment for this article.
In an interview on Wednesday with "CBS Mornings," Brendan Whitworth, the chief executive of Anheuser-Busch North America Zone, acknowledged that the last few weeks had been "challenging" for the brand.
"The conversation surrounding Bud Light has moved away from beer," Mr. Whitworth said, adding that he took responsibility for the controversy's impact on the company's employees, customers and distribution partners. "The conversation has become divisive, and Bud Light really doesn't belong there."
When asked if he would run the campaign with a transgender influencer again, Mr. Whitworth didn't directly respond.
"There's a big social conversation taking place right now, and big brands are right in the middle of it," he said. "And it's not just our industry or Bud Light. It's happening in retail. It's happening in fast food.
"And so for us, what we need to understand is, deeply understand and appreciate, is the consumer and what they want, what they care about and what they expect from big brands."
With the summer sales season well underway -- the four months between May and August make up as much as 40 percent of annual beer sales -- the question swirling around Bud Light is whether the slump is temporary or the new normal.
"Here we are about 10 weeks into it, and we're still seeing double-digit declines in volumes nationally," said Bump Williams, who runs the consulting firm that bears his name. "This is no longer an anomaly. This is a trend of concern."
Indeed, most larger beer distributors or wholesalers -- middlemen who buy brands from brewers like Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors and then sell them to stores, restaurants and bars -- believe the fallout will last more than six months, according to a survey released this month by the Wall Street investment bank Jefferies. A third of distributors believe the impact on Bud Light will be permanent.
Mr. Wagner said Anheuser-Busch had made a mistake when its marketing broke what he called "bar rules." That means "no politics, no religion." He noted that Glenn Miller's had never allowed local politicians to put up signs in or around the store so as not to alienate customers.
When asked how long he thought the sales declines would linger, Mr. Wagner shrugged. "I've seen longtime Bud Light customers trying other beers," he said. "If they find something they like, they may not come back."
Beer distributors, many of them independent or family-owned businesses, are acutely aware of the drop in Bud Light sales.
Steve Tatum, the general manager of family-owned Bama Budweiser in Montgomery, Ala., paid for a local radio commercial to discuss the backlash to Bud Light. "We, too, at Bama Budweiser are upset about it and have made our feelings known to the top leadership at Anheuser-Busch," Mr. Tatum said in the ad. He added that his company, an independent wholesaler, employed "around 100 people who live here, work here, and our children go to school here."
Mr. Tatum did not respond to a request for comment.
Anheuser-Busch also seems to be trying to remind the public of the people behind the beer. On Wednesday, the company released an ad campaign, "We Make the Beer," which focuses on the numerous steps involved in making beer, as well as the individuals behind the process. It has also hinted that it may bring back the popular Bud Knight character in advertising as part of its effort to move past the controversy.
The company has also been buying back or swapping out cases of Bud Light sitting in distributor warehouses when they reach their "best by" dates. In June, the company unveiled a multitiered plan to its distributors that included sales incentive payments and reimbursement for freight and fuel charges through the end of the year, according to Beer Business Daily.
For Glenn Miller's, the repercussions from the Bud Light controversy have not had much of a business impact. Operating since 1986, the retailer sells 1,500 brands of beer in its 18,000-square-foot warehouse.
"So if a consumer decides against a Bud Light, which is now down 30 percent year to date, they are fine in finding something else to try," Rodney Miller, the chief executive of Glenn Miller's, said in an email. (Mr. Miller founded the retailer with his father, Glenn.)
Mr. Wagner echoed those sentiments as he walked through the store's aisles.
"It's not that they stopped drinking beer," he said of his customers. "They just stopped buying Bud Light."

Cameras Peer Deep Into Inscrutable Hearts: [Review]

Full text: "Love Songs: Photography and Intimacy" at ICP reveals the camera's limitations as well as strengths when it comes to depicting romance.
In the thought-provoking exhibition, "Love Songs: Photography and Intimacy," at the International Center of Photography, two series of photographs by Nobuyoshi Araki face off on opposite walls.
In the first, "Sentimental Journey," from 1971, Araki charts his honeymoon with Yoko Aoki, his young wife. The sequence includes shots of her undressed, and one image shows her in orgasm. But the most intimate portraits, with Aoki fully clothed, expose her interior life. In the most poignant, she is sitting in a train compartment and looking off to the side, with an air of resignation and foreboding. I thought of the last line of Henry James's "The Bostonians," where the newly betrothed heroine weeps tears and the narrator remarks, "It was to be feared that ... these were not the last she was destined to shed."
The Araki marriage, however, seems to have been happy. The tears to be shed were his. In 1994, Aoki died of ovarian cancer, an illness Araki chronicled in "Winter Journey," from the hospital room all the way to the coffin and the household shrine constructed in her memory. The prints are time-stamped, as if each station of the journey was impressed on his soul. The couple's beloved cat patrols in many of the pictures, and magnolia flowers are featured in others. The pet and the blooms conjure up the spirit of the departed wife.
Love and loss. The ditty that played in my head as I walked through "Love Songs" is the one that begins, "You don't know what love is ... until you've loved a love you had to lose." There are 16 artists in the show, which has been adapted by the independent curator Sara Raza from an exhibition at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie (M.E.P.) in Paris. Many of the photographers are charting the end of a love affair. As songwriters have recognized, the pain of a breakup is more emotionally penetrating than the joy of a happy romance. But what can be readily conveyed in music is elusive in photography, where the subjects too easily become performers, and the desired feeling of intimacy turns theatrical.
Scrolling through photos on Instagram or Facebook, you get the sense that the people smiling joyously with their arms around each other are actors. Or rather, that they have embarked on these relationships mainly to advertise them: They are impersonating themselves. Karla Hiraldo Voleau tackles the theme of simulated intimacy in "Another Love Story," 2022. Arranged month by month, the pictures chronicle the artist's discovery that her lover has continued a relationship that he had told her was over. The installation includes transcripts of phone calls between Hiraldo Voleau and the other woman, who was also kept in the dark.
Underscoring the unreliability both of lovers and of social media posts about love affairs, Hiraldo Voleau displays pictures she took of her ex-boyfriend where his face is not discernible and mixes them with photos made after the breakup, restaging old scenes with a hired look-alike. Tellingly, I could see no difference between the shots in which she is with her real lover and those with the man pretending to be him; in all these pictures, the subjects are acting for the camera.
Leigh Ledare in "Double Bind," 2010, sought to show how a lover projects upon the beloved by photographing his ex-wife, five years after their divorce, in an isolated cabin in upstate New York. She had recently remarried. Two months later, Ledare persuaded her to visit the same dwelling with her new husband, Adam Fedderly, also a photographer, who portrayed her with his own camera. Ledare displays their photographs together, identifying the authorship by the color of the frames. In montages, he intermingled the photos with magazine cutouts, adding three vitrines brimming with more glossy clippings. It's an ingenious setup that once again illustrates the inherent ambiguity of photography. I could not distinguish between the visions of the two men.
Intimacy is difficult to capture in a photo. I didn't glean much from the posed portraits, many of them nude, that Collier Schorr made of her close collaborator, Angel Zinovieff. Nor was I so interested in the artsy shots that Lin Zhipeng took of his young male lovers. But I paused in wistful fascination before the sequence of photos by Hervé Guibert of his boyfriend, Thierry Jouno, both of them young, taken in the late '70s and '80s. There are nude images of Jouno, some X-rated. But the most intimate were a portrait of Jouno laying his head on a desk while cigarette smoke rises above, another of him grimacing as he looks in a mirror, and, in three posed pictures taken from different distances in a rustic room, Jouno standing, heartbreakingly handsome and obviously adored, his naked body concealed by gauzy veils. Surely some of my interest came from the knowledge that both Jouno, who directed an institute for the blind, and Guibert, who was a gifted writer as well as a photographer, would die of AIDS in their mid-30s.
The shadow of mortality also falls on "Proud Flesh," 2003-09, by Sally Mann, her photographs of her husband, Larry, who suffers from late-onset muscular dystrophy. She made them with the 19th-century wet-plate collodion process. Back when it was the state of the art, photographers expertly overcame the pitfalls of the technique, but Mann embraces the flaws. Like her naked husband, many of the pictures are blemished and distressed. The darkness and blurring created by this archaic process add to the elegiac mood.
Ergin Cavusoglu's "Silent Glide," 2008, and Fouad Elkoury's "On War and Love," 2006, both set a romantic breakup against a landscape of decay or strife. In Cavusoglu's staged three-channel video, a writer ends an affair with his married publisher, who is visiting him in Hereke, a Turkish seaside town once known for its production of silk rugs but dependent now, in addition to carpet manufacture, on shipping and a cement factory. Cavusoglu devotes as much attention to the degradation of the town as he does to the collapse of the affair.
Similarly, in "On War and Love," 2006, Elkoury chronicles in a diary format the dissolution of his relationship with a younger woman, a parting that coincides with a war in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. The photos are interspersed with texts, documenting the Israeli air and naval assault on Beirut and Elkoury's emotional turmoil in Istanbul, where he travels from Lebanon in a futile attempt to persuade his lover to stay with him. Instead of resonating with each other, however, the two stories, when juxtaposed, distanced me from each of them.
"Love Songs" left me wondering if the theatricality of posing and the ambiguity of still images undercut the capacity of photography to document intimacy. Various art forms afford different advantages and limitations. Novels are best at describing the complex charms and vicissitudes of love, which is why so many of these artists resort to texts along with images. "Love Songs" is as much about what photography can't do as about what it can.

LEMOYNE, Pa. — On a recent steamy Sunday afternoon, customers strolled through the aisles of Glenn Miller’s Beer & Soda Warehouse, where overhead fans circulated the hot air.
People heading to picnics, graduation parties and other get-togethers in Lemoyne, a Pennsylvania community just across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg, breezed into the store, passing myriad displays of beers, with cases of top brands stacked high.
Next to 30-packs of Miller Lite, on sale for $24.99, sat a stack of Bud Light. A large banner above it noted that, after a rebate, a 30-pack cost a mere $8.99.
Andy Wagner, the manager and an 18-year veteran of the store, said the Miller Lite was selling well. And the Bud Light? Not so much.
“At this point, it’s cheaper than some of the cases of water we’re selling in the back,” Wagner said, noting that sales of Bud Light at the store since mid-April were down 45% from a year ago. “It’s just not moving like it used to.”
Nearly three months after transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney posted a video on her Instagram account to promote a Bud Light contest, setting off online outrage from the right and a boycott, the beer brand is still struggling to win back loyal, longtime customers.
For more than two decades, Bud Light was the bestselling beer in the United States. Its sales exceeded $5 billion last year, roughly 9% of Anheuser-Busch InBev’s revenue. But since the boycott, Bud Light has been dethroned by Modelo Especial. In the four weeks that ended in mid-June, the volume of Bud Light sold nationally plunged an average of 29% from a year earlier, according to data from the research firm NIQ, analyzed by the consulting firm Bump Williams.
Anheuser-Busch’s stock has also dropped more than 15% since early April. The company did not respond to a request for comment for this article.
In an interview Wednesday with “CBS Mornings,” Brendan Whitworth, the CEO of Anheuser-Busch North America Zone, acknowledged that the last few weeks had been “challenging” for the brand.
“The conversation surrounding Bud Light has moved away from beer,” Whitworth said, adding that he took responsibility for the controversy’s impact on the company’s employees, customers and distribution partners. “The conversation has become divisive, and Bud Light really doesn’t belong there.”
When asked if he would run the campaign with a transgender influencer again, Whitworth didn’t directly respond.
“There’s a big social conversation taking place right now, and big brands are right in the middle of it,” he said. “And it’s not just our industry or Bud Light. It’s happening in retail. It’s happening in fast food.
“And so for us, what we need to understand is — deeply understand and appreciate is — the consumer and what they want, what they care about and what they expect from big brands.”
With the summer sales season well underway — the four months between May and August make up as much as 40% of annual beer sales — the question swirling around Bud Light is whether the slump is temporary or the new normal.
“Here we are, about 10 weeks into it, and we’re still seeing double-digit declines in volumes nationally,” said Bump Williams, who runs the consulting firm that bears his name. “This is no longer an anomaly. This is a trend of concern.”
Indeed, most larger beer distributors or wholesalers — middlemen who buy brands from brewers like Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors and then sell them to stores, restaurants and bars — believe the fallout will last more than six months, according to a survey released this month by the Wall Street investment bank Jefferies. One-third of distributors believe the impact on Bud Light will be permanent.
Wagner said Anheuser-Busch had made a mistake when its marketing broke what he called “bar rules.” That means “no politics, no religion.” He noted that Glenn Miller’s had never allowed local politicians to put up signs in or around the store so as not to alienate customers.
When asked how long he thought the sales declines would linger, Wagner shrugged. “I’ve seen longtime Bud Light customers trying other beers,” he said. “If they find something they like, they may not come back.”
Beer distributors, many of them independent or family-owned businesses, are acutely aware of the drop in Bud Light sales.
Steve Tatum, the general manager of family-owned Bama Budweiser in Montgomery, Alabama, paid for a local radio commercial to discuss the backlash to Bud Light. “We, too, at Bama Budweiser are upset about it and have made our feelings known to the top leadership at Anheuser-Busch,” Tatum said in the ad. He added that his company, an independent wholesaler, employed “around 100 people who live here, work here, and our children go to school here.”
Tatum did not respond to a request for comment.
Anheuser-Busch also seems to be trying to remind the public of the people behind the beer. On Wednesday, the company released an ad campaign, “We Make the Beer,” which focuses on the numerous steps involved in making beer, as well as the individuals behind the process. It has also hinted that it may bring back the popular Bud Knight character in advertising as part of its effort to move past the controversy.
The company has also been buying back or swapping out cases of Bud Light sitting in distributor warehouses when they reach their “best by” dates. In June, the company unveiled a multitiered plan to its distributors that included sales incentive payments and reimbursement for freight and fuel charges through the end of the year, according to Beer Business Daily.
For Glenn Miller’s, the repercussions from the Bud Light controversy have not had much of a business impact. Operating since 1986, the retailer sells 1,500 brands of beer in its 18,000-square-foot warehouse.
“So if a consumer decides against a Bud Light, which is now down 30 percent year to date, they are fine in finding something else to try,” Rodney Miller, the CEO of Glenn Miller’s, said in an email. (Miller founded the retailer with his father, Glenn.)
Wagner echoed those sentiments as he walked through the store’s aisles.
“It’s not that they stopped drinking beer,” he said of his customers. “They just stopped buying Bud Light.”

As Creators Sue Montana, It's TikTok Footing the Bill: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When five TikTok creators in Montana filed a lawsuit last month, saying the state's new ban of the app violated their First Amendment rights and far outstripped the government's legal authority, it appeared to be a grass-roots effort.
One relevant fact that the creators and TikTok didn't mention: The company is financing their case.
For more than a month, the popular video service deflected questions about its involvement in the suit. When the case was filed, TikTok said it was weighing whether to file a separate one -- a move the company made several days later.
This week, Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for TikTok, acknowledged that it was paying for the users' lawsuit after two of them told The New York Times about the company's involvement.
"Many creators have expressed major concerns both privately and publicly about the potential impact of the Montana law on their livelihoods," Ms. Seth said. "We support our creators in fighting for their constitutional rights."
While TikTok is funding the lawsuit, the creators said, the company is not paying them directly for their role.
TikTok's financing illustrates how central its users in Montana are to the company's effort to combat the ban, which is set to go into effect on Jan. 1. Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, signed the bill last month, citing concerns that TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, could expose private user data to the Beijing government. TikTok says it has never been asked to provide, nor provided, U.S. user data to Beijing.
The company is relying on the group of Montana residents to show how the ban would harm users rather than protect them. The strategy in Montana is similar to the one it deployed in 2020 after President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order barring TikTok from operating in the United States. At that time, too, TikTok covertly funded a lawsuit brought by creators, The Wall Street Journal reported, and the action fended off the ban. TikTok is not required to disclose its funding of cases.
TikTok has sought to highlight its users in front of lawmakers and in marketing, putting faces to the app in Montana and nationally as calls for bans have increased since November. The company featured creators in a recent "TikTok Sparks Good" campaign and flew TikTok stars to Capitol Hill in March when its chief executive testified before Congress.
"From a public relations point of view, the lawyers may think it works better if the public sees the creators as entirely independent of TikTok, as little people who are being harmed rather than being agents or emissaries of TikTok," said Stephen Gillers, a professor emeritus of legal ethics at New York University School of Law.
He said filing separate suits was strategically sound for the company, as the creators' case could be stronger than TikTok's complaint "because the creators can claim a personal First Amendment interest in challenging the Montana law."
Some of the Montana creators named in the suit declined to talk about how they had been brought into the effort. But two others discussed being contacted by lawyers for TikTok, including Heather DiRocco, a 36-year-old mother of three in Bozeman who has 200,000 followers on the app.
Ms. DiRocco's TikTok account often contains comedy videos in which she riffs about her previous experiences as a woman in the Marines. She took a more serious turn in March after she learned about Montana's bill, urging other residents to use an #MTlovesTikTok hashtag in videos and to call the governor's office to voice opposition. A few weeks later, she posted a video criticizing how lawmakers had grilled TikTok's chief executive at the March congressional hearing.
TikTok's lawyers reached out to Ms. DiRocco in April to see if she would be interested in being a plaintiff in a suit challenging the bill. She was intrigued, she said, after learning she would not have to pay Davis Wright Tremaine, the law firm leading the challenge, and reading about how the firm represented the TikTok creators who successfully challenged the federal ban in 2020.
"I was like, you know what, I would love to help out with this because I already don't like it, I'm already advocating for it on my channel," Ms. DiRocco said. "I'd love to be a part of this so it can go further than what I can get it to do."
The firm said it had contacted many creators who expressed concerns about the Montana law and let them know that if they wanted to fight the ban, TikTok would help file and pay for a lawsuit.
"The fact that TikTok is paying for the suit is irrelevant to the legal merits of the case," said Ambika Kumar, one of the firm's lawyers and the lead attorney for the creators.
The creators in the lawsuit have been thrust into the national spotlight and have faced questions about why they are standing up for TikTok. All five said they loved the app. While most earn some money from it, Alice Held, a 25-year-old college student in Missoula with 217,000 followers on TikTok, said she had joined the effort even though she made, "at most, $ 15 a month" from video views.
"They chose a pretty diverse range of plaintiffs when I think about all of our backgrounds -- there's a veteran, a business owner, a rancher who lives in rural Montana," Ms. Held said. "The young person slash student perspective is probably the role I play within the five of us."
She was motivated to join the suit by her belief in free speech and her view that the concerns about Chinese government access to TikTok data were overblown, Ms. Held said. "When people ask what's my stake, it goes back to the First Amendment rights and free speech and wanting to protect that for Montanans," she said.
Another plaintiff, Samantha Alario, who lives Missoula, said the platform enabled her to reach customers for her swimwear brand whom she would not be able to connect with on sites like Facebook and Instagram. She said the group represented "normal, everyday folks" who used the app.
"We are not TikTok stars," Ms. Alario, 35, said. "We walked into the lion's den almost a whole week before TikTok decided to come and back us up on this, because we see how important this is."
Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, said that the users' lawsuit put the focus on how Montana's ban would harm Americans and that he expected the courts to strike it down.
"TikTok is an American company and has First Amendment rights, but there has been rhetoric in Montana and the federal government suggesting that TikTok's connections to China mean it's not an ordinary First Amendment actor," Mr. Jaffer said.
The lawsuit "really emphasizes that this isn't just about the rights of TikTok, let alone the rights of ByteDance," he added. "It's about the rights of TikTok's users, including its American users, and I think that's a really important point to make."

Full text: So does the pop culture and fashion wheel turn.
And just like that, stealth wealth, the aesthetic made viral by "Succession," with its toxic billionaires in their Loro Piana baseball caps and Tom Ford hoodies locked in a C-suite cage match to the death, has been swept off screen.
In its place: logomania, branding that can be seen from whole city blocks away and accessories that jangle and gleam with the blinding light of bragging rights.
The outfits, that is to say, of Carrie and Co. in Season 2 of "And Just Like That ...," the "Sex and the City" reboot come recently to Max -- the streamer that, as it happens, also gave us the Roys in their greige cashmere. Both shows are set in New York City, the home of strivers and entrepreneurs, of "Washington Square" and Wharton, of constantly evolving social castes highly, and literally, invested in their own identifiable camouflage.
If watching "Succession" was in part like engaging in a detective game to suss out what character was wearing what brand, so insider were the fashion politics, watching "And Just Like That ..." is like attending brandapalooza: the double Cs and Fs and Gs practically whacking you on the head with their presence. (Warning: Spoilers are coming.) All the over-the-top fashionista-ing is back. The room-size closets!
It's the yin to the "Succession" yang: a veritable celebration of the comforting aspirational dreams of self-realization (or self-escapism) embedded in stuff that may actually be the most striking part of an increasingly stale series. Certainly, the clothes, which often serve as their own plot points, are more memorable than any dialogue.
Well ... except maybe for that instantly classic line in Episode 1, uttered by Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) on her way to the Met Gala in reference to her gown and feather hat: "It's not crazy -- it's Valentino." But that's the exception that proves the rule.
There is Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), with her multiple Manolos and Fendis, self-medicating with shopping, returning home one day with six Bergdorf Goodman bags. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) toting her Burberry doggy poop bag (also possessed of a Burberry apron and Burberry ear muffs) and bemoaning the fact that her teenage daughter hocked her Chanel dress to fund her musical aspirations.
Lisa Todd Wexley dropping her kids off for camp in a bright green Louis Vuitton jacket and scarf. And Seema (Sarita Choudhury), the character that passes for a restrained dresser thanks to her penchant for neutrals (and the occasional animal print), loudly lamenting the theft of her caramel-colored Hermès Birkin -- one of her totems of self, ripped directly from her hands.
There is Loewe and Pierre Cardin; Altuzarra and Dries Van Noten. There is also an effort to repurpose clothes, like Carrie's wedding dress, in order to promote the virtues of rewearing, but it's pretty much lost in all the rest of the muchness. There is a dedicated Instagram account on which the costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago share their finds, with 277,000 followers. @Successionfashion, by contrast, has 184,000.
All of which means what, exactly? Is the era of quiet luxury, so recently embraced by TikTok, already at an end? Have our attention spans, so famously abbreviated, moved on? Has the physics of fashion exerted its force and produced an equal and opposite reaction to an earlier action?
As if. In many ways, the fashion in "And Just Like That ..." seems to protest too much. In part that's because it seems like a regurgitation of the fun that came before, which was itself a reaction to the minimalism of the early 1990s, which itself was born in that decade's recession.
The fact is, no matter how much lip service has been paid to quiet luxury or stealth wealth or whatever you want to call it, and how it is 2023's "hottest new fashion trend," it was never a recent invention. It has been around since way back when it was referred to as "shabby chic" or "connoisseurship" or "old money," all synonyms for the kind of product that didn't look overtly expensive but was a sign of aesthetic genealogy -- the difference between new money and inherited money that fashion co-opted and regurgitated to its own ends. Just as more obviously coded consumption has been around since Louis Vuitton plunked his initials on some leather back in 1896 or since Jay Gatsby started tossing his shirts.
We've been declaring the "end of logos" and, alternately, the "rise of stealth wealth" for decades now. There are cycles when one is more ubiquitous than the other (usually having to do with economic downturns when flaunting disposable income is not a great look), but they exist in tandem. They help define each other.
Consider that during the current economic uncertainty, exactly the kind of environment that tends to fast-forward the appeal of low-key high-cost items, the most successful global brands have remained the most highly identifiable: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hermès. Or that in his recent debut for Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams introduced a bag called Millionaire that costs -- yup -- $ 1 million. (It's a yellow croc Speedy with gold and diamond hardware.)
What is more interesting is, as Carrie and the gang continue on their merry wardrobed way, how clichéd both styles now seem, how performative. Once they have trickled up to television, it's impossible not to recognize the costume. Or the fact that whichever look you buy into, they are simply different ways of expressing wealth, in all its decorative strata. And wealth itself never goes out of fashion.

“They chose a pretty diverse range of plaintiffs when I think about all of our backgrounds — there’s a veteran, a business owner, a rancher who lives in rural Montana,” Held said. “The young person slash student perspective is probably the role I play within the five of us.”
She was motivated to join the suit by her belief in free speech and her view that the concerns about Chinese government access to TikTok data were overblown, Held said. “When people ask what’s my stake, it goes back to the First Amendment rights and free speech and wanting to protect that for Montanans,” she said.
Another plaintiff, Samantha Alario, who lives Missoula, said the platform enabled her to reach customers for her swimwear brand whom she would not be able to connect with on sites like Facebook and Instagram. She said the group represented “normal, everyday folks” who used the app.
“We are not TikTok stars,” said Alario, 35. “We walked into the lion’s den almost a whole week before TikTok decided to come and back us up on this, because we see how important this is.”
Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, said that the users’ lawsuit put the focus on how Montana’s ban would harm Americans and that he expected the courts to strike it down.
“TikTok is an American company and has First Amendment rights, but there has been rhetoric in Montana and the federal government suggesting that TikTok’s connections to China mean it’s not an ordinary First Amendment actor,” Jaffer said.
The lawsuit “really emphasizes that this isn’t just about the rights of TikTok, let alone the rights of ByteDance,” he added. “It’s about the rights of TikTok’s users, including its American users, and I think that’s a really important point to make.”

Food Near Forest Hills Stadium to Fuel Up for Fun: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: If you're headed to a concert at this former tennis complex, here are a few options for food.
There are a few summer inevitabilities: A heat wave that will test the limits of your window air-conditioner. Sweating on a subway platform. One of your favorite bands or musicians playing a show at Forest Hills Stadium.
Concerts are a boon for restaurants in that tree-lined section of Queens, and, if you're not a local, you may find yourself wandering among the area's Tudor-style buildings in the coming months searching for a quick bite or an entire meal.
If you need a preshow pick-me-up ...
Compared with performances at venues like Kings Theater or the Bowery Ballroom, most shows at Forest Hills start on the earlier side, with doors opening between 3 and 6 p.m. depending on the show -- great news for anyone who prefers to pregame with iced coffee and loves getting to bed before midnight.
Try Forest Cafe, open since October, a charming coffee shop outfitted in blond wood and hanging paper lights about a five-minute walk from the stadium. This is where you can get that iced latte or cold brew, or a matcha-based drink without the grainy texture that makes most examples disappointing. I wouldn't necessarily rely on them for food -- on a recent visit they were sold out of everything at 2 p.m. -- but if you're lucky, you might be able to grab a gochujang tamago sandwich or a croffle (croissant-waffle) drizzled with Nutella.
If you're running late ...
Familiarize yourself with Forest Hill's main drag, Austin Street, one block south of the Forest Hills-71st Avenue subway station. This commercial strip is teeming with popular chains like Shake Shack, Bareburger and a Boston Market. But if there's one I'd recommend, it's Oh K-Dog.
That K stands for Korean, and the specialty is made-to-order corn dogs encrusted in a deep-fried, slightly sweet, rice flour-based batter. The hot dog itself is no Nathan's or Sabrett, but it doesn't matter much as you bite into a perfectly crisp exterior drizzled with your choice of toppings, or -- my favorite variation -- a rice-cake corn dog. Take yours to go on the way to the stadium, or stick around and watch K-pop music videos on the restaurant's TV.
If you have time before the show ...
For a proper sit-down meal you can fly through with relative ease, walk over to Tengri Tagh, a tiny restaurant, also on Austin Street, that specializes in Uyghur cuisine. This location, open since May, is the restaurant's second. (The original is on West 37th Street near Seventh Avenue in Manhattan.)
Tengri Tagh exemplifies hospitality. When I visited (anonymously) on a hot Sunday afternoon, Kudusi Simayi, an owner, handed me and my friend two ice-cold Coca-Colas on the house. The portions at Tengri Tagh are as generous as the service, so it's best to choose one menu item to split between two people. A nonnegotiable order is the handmade noodles with Uyghur stir-fried lamb, featuring pleasantly chewy lagman noodles surrounded by thinly sliced halal lamb, tomatoes, green peppers and cloud ear mushrooms in a sauce that is spicy enough to awaken the senses without overwhelming them. In other words, it's worth visiting whether you have concert tickets or not.
In other news ...
Two things: I made a mistake two weeks ago and said that the original Frenchette Bakery is closing; it is not. They're simply adding a second location. The other thing is that the jerk chicken cart I mentioned in last week's newsletter is called Wadadli Jerk and you can, and should, enjoy their Caribbean cuisine six days a week at their newish brick and mortar space at 419 Putnam Avenue in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.
This week, Pete Wells reviews the new Superiority Burger, finding many of the restaurant's decisions seem to stem from the question, "Wouldn't it be cool if ..." The attention to detail, Pete writes, pays off: "Sitting in a booth at Superiority Burger for an hour or so gives you a stronger sense of place than reading some novels."
Openings: Nasrin's Kitchen is bringing Iranian cooking to a space on West 57th Street; and Cecchi's Bar and Grill on West 13th Street is leaning into old-school fine dining (think chicken à la king and crab Louis) starting on Saturday.
In her latest, Tejal Rao looks at the new season of the hit show "The Bear," and how "it conveys an unexpected optimism about the restaurant industry and the people who make it run."
The pandemic -- and a sudden hyperawareness of how illnesses spread -- nearly spelled the end for the buffet. But in the face of inflation and rising food costs, the wallet-friendly buffet is making a comeback, reports Kim Severson.

The Anonymous, Subtle Messages Of Mini Protesters Against the War: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fish, asterisks, blank messages and the crossed out letter Z: All of these are symbols of opposition to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In a country where public criticism of the war comes with the threat of incarceration, protesters have taken to social media to remain anonymous and adopted a secret language to convey dissent for the Kremlin.
Last year in St. Petersburg, an artist uploaded a few images of tiny clay figurines in a public space to Instagram under the account Malenkiy Piket, meaning Small Protest. In a separate post, he invited others to join him in his silent demonstration.
Since that post, he has received almost 2,000 images containing homemade figurines, many holding posters of protest with curious symbology. Contributors are able to preserve their anonymity by sending private messages in the app to the artist, who then posts their images. At its peak, the account received around 60 images daily, the artist told The Times.
Sending such pictures, even privately, carries enormous risk: Sharing antiwar messages can be a cause for imprisonment. Hiding figurines in public spaces could be captured by surveillance cameras. Police used CCTV footage to track and arrest one contributor in 2022.
Using strategic ambiguity to protest authoritarian governments is not unique to Russia: pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong held up blank signs as a form of protest, and social media users in China used the candle emoji to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
The artist told The Times that it's important for people to see that Russians oppose the war, too. "Not everyone is with Putin. We know how the media just skips this, cuts out everything that shows people against it."
"These little men did what it became impossible for us to do openly. And I saw that there are people who, like me, are against this war," said a contributor, an activist who lives in Russia.
She explained that she searches for a public place where there are no cameras and waits for the moment when no one is around. "I take a photo and quickly leave. It's like a game sometimes," she said. "And it would be fun if not for the context."
Another contributor said she was inspired to send images to Malenkiy Piket because she said her images can last longer than the street protests, which were broken up by the police long ago.
"It's important also for people like myself to see that I'm not alone," she said.
The messages in the images
Fish
In 2022, a woman was arrested for writing "нет в***e" in graffiti in a public square, putting asterisks instead of letters in some places. The police believed she had intended to write the word "война" for war, but the woman said she had written "вобла," a fish native to the Caspian Sea that Russians traditionally eat with beer or vodka.
The story went viral, producing tons of memes and even a song. The woman was eventually fined, but by then, her story had already turned the vobla fish and asterisks into symbols of protest.
Blank Posters
Blank posters underscore how Russia has criminalized free speech. During the first months of 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine, many Russians took to the streets with blank posters, and the police arrested them.
Antiwar Flag
Recognized as an antiwar symbol, the white flag with a blue stripe in the middle was created by Russians who opposed the invasion of Ukraine and disapproved of Putin's government.
The Crossed Out Z
Members of the Russian army emblazon their tanks and trucks with the letter Z to differentiate themselves from Ukrainians in the field. Many of Malenkiy Piket's images show the letter Z crossed out.
Peace
About a hundred images shared by Malenkiy Piket show the peace sign.
Messages in Russian
Most of the figurines hold messages written in Russian. Malenkiy Piket said that most of the images he received were from people living in Russia, but many were sent from Ukraine and other former Soviet states.
International Support
Hundreds of images show the Ukrainian flag. Hundreds more have messages written in English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and other languages.

From Walk To Workout: [Science Desk]

Full text: There are simple ways to increase intensity without turning your stroll into a slog.
We're halfway through our monthlong newsletter series dedicated to the joys of walking. This week, we're making our walk into a workout.
Walking, at any intensity, is good for you. A slow, steady pace has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. But research suggests that increasing the length of your walk can lower the risk of premature death and diseases such as cancer -- and raising the intensity brings additional benefits.
To help us level up our walks, I reached out to Janet Dufek, a professor of kinesiology and nutrition sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I also took a fitness-focused walk with Martinus Evans, a certified running coach and the founder of Slow AF Run Club.
Evans and I explored Prospect Park in Brooklyn, where he reminded me that a workout walk, more than anything else, should be fun. "We're not elite athletes," he said. "We're walking for joy, and we can make up our own rules."
Get your arms involved.
Walking engages large muscle groups -- like glutes and quads -- but if it's your only form of movement, try adding exercises that focus on your upper body, Dr. Dufek said.
Consider bringing one- or two-pound weights with you, Evans suggested. You can use them while you're walking, he said, or pull over and do bicep curls or shoulder presses.
Dr. Dufek suggested trying arm motions like air punching: holding the weights and extending your arms in front of you, as if you were boxing. You can also make a "T" shape with your arms as you hold the weights, bending and extending at the elbow.
Instead of weights, you can bring filled-up water bottles, which can serve as makeshift weights as you first start out, Dr. Dufek added. They will also serve as motivation to stay hydrated later in your walk, she added, "as you drink down your stash."
If you don't want to carry weights, you can swing your arms more vigorously or try arm circles. Start with wide arcs and slowly "minimize them until they're very small circles," Evans said. Go in one direction for 30 seconds, and then switch to the other direction.
Use your environment.
As you walk, Evans said, look for ways to build in a little more activity. When we passed a park bench, he suggested we do a few squats. ("Get up, sit back down.") Another option: Stop and do 10 standing calf raises. (Raise your heels slowly, hold for a few seconds, and then lower your heels back to the ground.)
Change up your pace and route.
You can boost your workout by walking on different terrain, Dr. Dufek said. "It is harder to walk on loose trail dirt than on a sidewalk," she said. If you can go to the beach, Dr. Dufek added, dry sand is "an extreme walking surface" that requires more effort.
You can also vary your intensity and speed, she said. Pick up the pace for 30 seconds, she said, and then recover for three minutes.
If you're with a friend, consider a contest.
If you're walking with someone, try engaging in "a little friendly competition," Evans said. "You can say, 'All right, the last person to the stoplight -- and you got to walk, no running -- buys coffee."'
Count dogs instead of minutes.
To build endurance and keep on the trail longer, don't fixate on time, Evans said. Instead, he suggested counting "all the dogs you see, and make it a goal not to go home until you see 25 dogs." Or you can count stoplights, he said, or fire hydrants. "Make it fun," he said.
As Evans and I walked along, we pointed out pups to each other. At the end of our walk, we sat on a bench and totaled up everything we'd seen. Ten dogs. Two hot dog vendors. And, Evans reminded me, one shirtless guy on a unicycle.
"If you're counting shirtless guys on unicycles instead of dogs," he said, "your walk may be shorter."
A workout-walk playlist from Lindsay Zoladz of The Amplifier.
Need a little motivation to amp up your walk? Below, you'll find a curated playlist -- and commentary -- from Lindsay Zoladz, a pop music critic at The Times who writes our subscriber-only newsletter The Amplifier.
Check out her recommendations, and listen to the entire playlist while you walk.
1. Haim: "I Want You Back"
Practice your walking swagger by channeling the synced-up Haim sisters strutting down the empty streets of Los Angeles in the great music video for this 2017 hit. (Listen on YouTube.)

2. The Magnetic Fields: "When My Boy Walks Down the Street"
Just one of the titular "69 Love Songs" on the Magnetic Fields' landmark 1999 triple album, this hazy power-pop song makes any stroll feel a little more cinematic. (Listen on YouTube.)

3. Nancy Sinatra: "These Boots Are Made for Walkin"'
Are you ready, boots? Lee Hazlewood wrote this classic and initially sang it himself onstage before Nancy Sinatra convinced him to let her record it. Coming from a man, she thought the song sounded "harsh," though it was "perfect for a little girl to sing." (Listen on YouTube.)

4. Stevie Wonder: "Uptight (Everything's Alright)"
Nothing like some vintage Stevie to put that extra pep in your step. (Listen on YouTube.)

5. Hugh Masekela: "Grazing in the Grass"
Despite what its title says, the tempo of this 1968 instrumental classic recorded by the jazz great Hugh Masekela is a bit too fast for grazing. (Listen on YouTube.)

6. Mitski: "Washing Machine Heart"
Speaking of tempo, the stomping percussion -- which sounds like a pair of shoes knocking around in a washing machine -- in this off-kilter TikTok hit from the indie pop star Mitski is sure to keep you moving. (Listen on YouTube.)

7. Parquet Courts: "Walking at a Downtown Pace"
Released in 2021, this driving tune by New York's own Parquet Courts perfectly captured the desire to hit the streets after the lockdown. As frontman Andrew Savage puts it in his signature deadpan, "Walk at a downtown pace and treasure the crowds that once made me act so annoyed." (Listen on YouTube.)

8. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: "Out in the Street"
This fan favorite from Springsteen's 1980 album "The River" is a staple of his live shows, and a celebration of freedom after a long workday: "When I'm out in the street, I walk the way I want to walk." (Listen on YouTube.)

9. Fats Domino: "I'm Walkin"'
How much richer is popular music because the word "walk" rhymes with "talk"? Among the many songs that feature this rhyme scheme is this ambling anthem from the rock 'n' roll pioneer Fats Domino. Good luck standing still while this one's playing. (Listen on YouTube.)
Women have more sleep difficulties than men do. Here's why.
Research shows that women are significantly more likely than men to report challenges falling and staying asleep. Reasons can include the hormonal changes that occur throughout a woman's reproductive cycle and an increased risk of anxiety and depression, which can disrupt sleep. Fortunately, treatments are available, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I.

Full text: Gaps in campaign rules allow politicians to spread images and messaging generated by increasingly powerful artificial intelligence technology.
In Toronto, a candidate in this week's mayoral election who vows to clear homeless encampments released a set of campaign promises illustrated by artificial intelligence, including fake dystopian images of people camped out on a downtown street and a fabricated image of tents set up in a park.
In New Zealand, a political party posted a realistic-looking rendering on Instagram of fake robbers rampaging through a jewelry shop.
In Chicago, the runner-up in the mayoral vote in April complained that a Twitter account masquerading as a news outlet had used A.I. to clone his voice in a way that suggested he condoned police brutality.
What began a few months ago as a slow drip of fund-raising emails and promotional images composed by A.I. for political campaigns has turned into a steady stream of campaign materials created by the technology, rewriting the political playbook for democratic elections around the world.
Increasingly, political consultants, election researchers and lawmakers say setting up new guardrails, such as legislation reining in synthetically generated ads, should be an urgent priority. Existing defenses, such as social media rules and services that claim to detect A.I. content, have failed to do much to slow the tide.
As the 2024 U.S. presidential race starts to heat up, some of the campaigns are already testing the technology. The Republican National Committee released a video with artificially generated images of doomsday scenarios after President Biden announced his re-election bid, while Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida posted fake images of former President Donald J. Trump with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former health official. The Democratic Party experimented with fund-raising messages drafted by artificial intelligence in the spring -- and found that they were often more effective at encouraging engagement and donations than copy written entirely by humans.
Some politicians see artificial intelligence as a way to help reduce campaign costs, by using it to create instant responses to debate questions or attack ads, or to analyze data that might otherwise require expensive experts.
At the same time, the technology has the potential to spread disinformation to a wide audience. An unflattering fake video, an email blast full of false narratives churned out by computer or a fabricated image of urban decay can reinforce prejudices and widen the partisan divide by showing voters what they expect to see, experts say.
The technology is already far more powerful than manual manipulation -- not perfect, but fast improving and easy to learn. In May, the chief executive of OpenAI, Sam Altman, whose company helped kick off an artificial intelligence boom last year with its popular ChatGPT chatbot, told a Senate subcommittee that he was nervous about election season.
He said the technology's ability "to manipulate, to persuade, to provide sort of one-on-one interactive disinformation" was "a significant area of concern."
Representative Yvette D. Clarke, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement last month that the 2024 election cycle "is poised to be the first election where A.I.-generated content is prevalent." She and other congressional Democrats, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have introduced legislation that would require political ads that used artificially generated material to carry a disclaimer. A similar bill in Washington State was recently signed into law.
The American Association of Political Consultants recently condemned the use of deepfake content in political campaigns as a violation of its ethics code.
"People are going to be tempted to push the envelope and see where they can take things," said Larry Huynh, the group's incoming president. "As with any tool, there can be bad uses and bad actions using them to lie to voters, to mislead voters, to create a belief in something that doesn't exist."
The technology's recent intrusion into politics came as a surprise in Toronto, a city that supports a thriving ecosystem of artificial intelligence research and start-ups. The mayoral election takes place on Monday.
A conservative candidate in the race, Anthony Furey, a former news columnist, recently laid out his platform in a document that was dozens of pages long and filled with synthetically generated content to help him make his tough-on-crime position.
A closer look clearly showed that many of the images were not real: One laboratory scene featured scientists who looked like alien blobs. A woman in another rendering wore a pin on her cardigan with illegible lettering; similar markings appeared in an image of caution tape at a construction site. Mr. Furey's campaign also used a synthetic portrait of a seated woman with two arms crossed and a third arm touching her chin.
The other candidates mined that image for laughs in a debate this month: "We're actually using real pictures," said Josh Matlow, who showed a photo of his family and added that "no one in our pictures have three arms."
Still, the sloppy renderings were used to amplify Mr. Furey's argument. He gained enough momentum to become one of the most recognizable names in an election with more than 100 candidates. In the same debate, he acknowledged using the technology in his campaign, adding that "we're going to have a couple of laughs here as we proceed with learning more about A.I."
Political experts worry that artificial intelligence, when misused, could have a corrosive effect on the democratic process. Misinformation is a constant risk; one of Mr. Furey's rivals said in a debate that while members of her staff used ChatGPT, they always fact-checked its output.
"If someone can create noise, build uncertainty or develop false narratives, that could be an effective way to sway voters and win the race," Darrell M. West, a senior fellow for the Brookings Institution, wrote in a report last month. "Since the 2024 presidential election may come down to tens of thousands of voters in a few states, anything that can nudge people in one direction or another could end up being decisive."
Increasingly sophisticated A.I. content is appearing more frequently on social networks that have been largely unwilling or unable to police it, said Ben Colman, the chief executive of Reality Defender, a company that offers services to detect A.I. The feeble oversight allows unlabeled synthetic content to do "irreversible damage" before it is addressed, he said.
"Explaining to millions of users that the content they already saw and shared was fake, well after the fact, is too little, too late," Mr. Colman said.
For several days this month, a Twitch livestream has run a nonstop, not-safe-for-work debate between synthetic versions of Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump. Both were clearly identified as simulated "A.I. entities," but if an organized political campaign created such content and it spread widely without any disclosure, it could easily degrade the value of real material, disinformation experts said.
Politicians could shrug off accountability and claim that authentic footage of compromising actions was not real, a phenomenon known as the liar's dividend. Ordinary citizens could make their own fakes, while others could entrench themselves more deeply in polarized information bubbles, believing only what sources they chose to believe.
"If people can't trust their eyes and ears, they may just say, 'Who knows?"' Josh A. Goldstein, a research fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, wrote in an email. "This could foster a move from healthy skepticism that encourages good habits (like lateral reading and searching for reliable sources) to an unhealthy skepticism that it is impossible to know what is true."

Hot Pink Moves Into Interior Design in a Bold Way: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Barbiecore, a palette made up primarily of hot pink, is surging its way into home décor, sparked by the upcoming movie and maximalism.
Amanda Hansen loves a hot pink moment. "I think I just naturally am such a pink froufrou girl. All my stuff. Everything I buy is always a little bit Barbie-esque," she said. "So it has taken over."
Ms. Hansen, a graphic designer in Tacoma, Wash., infused her home with colors fit for Barbie's Dreamhouse, from pink Smeg appliances in the kitchen to purple and pink floral wallpaper in the dining room and tons of colorful accents in between. The pièce de résistance, though, is the backyard Barbie oasis. There, Ms. Hansen, 31, installed a hot pink aboveground pool, which she purchased on Amazon for about $ 150, and shaded it with a banana leaf print umbrella. She painted a pink and white checkered floor on the concrete patio and, soon, a pink cabana with a striped curtain will round off the space.
"I wanted to make it that Palm Springs feel with all pink, just as Barbie as I can get it to look, like it's not a little backyard here in Tacoma," said Ms. Hansen. Barbiecore, a palette made up primarily of hot pink, and similarly bold rosy hues like fuchsia and magenta, is surging its way into home décor with the forthcoming release of the "Barbie" movie serving as a catalyst.
Information shared by Pinterest, the web service where people can save images to virtual pinboards, shows that there was a 1,135 percent increase in searches for "Barbie aesthetic bedroom" from May 2022 to May 2023. The web service also saw an increase in other searches for hot pink décor including bathroom décor and kitchen cabinets, said Swasti Sarna, Pinterest's global director of data insights.
Simply wearing hot pink isn't enough, people want to be surrounded by it at home, too.
Hot pink fits right into maximalism, which experienced a resurgence in recent years as a response to the cool minimalist aesthetic that dominated Instagram feeds for so long. During the pandemic, people leaned into their personal styles at home, disco balls to handmade tiles.
When Ms. Hansen married her husband six years ago, she gave farmhouse décor a try. "It wasn't my style, and I realized that, but I was trying to be mature," she said. "So it just kind of started happening one day and I think it was probably three or four years ago and I started painting the walls and it just has escalated."
In Nashville, Beverly Griffith always loved the color and incorporated it into her home décor when she bought her house in 2017. "Millennial pink isn't nearly pink enough for me," said Ms. Griffith, 42. Her bathroom, for example, has a hot pink shower curtain and pink tub and the recently renovated kitchen has hot pink appliances, which Ms. Griffith painted herself.
At the start of the pandemic, when she left her job as a bartender, Ms. Griffith brought that affinity for hot pink to her home's exterior, too, by painting it in three different vibrant hues. The house became a social media sensation and now she rents it out to musicians and content creators who use the space for the day. "Since I've painted my house pink, I've met people or read comments on social media, saying that they've been embarrassed to say they like pink in the past," said Ms. Griffith. "They've thanked me for being so outwardly and confidently pink."
Pink is often thought of as a feminine color, but that wasn't always the case. According to Color Psychology, pink was originally worn by boys because it was a paler version of the red used in military uniforms. Eventually, pink was rebranded as a girl's color. Hot pink made waves when Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli released her own iteration, called "Shocking pink," in the mid-1930s.
The original Barbie doll didn't even wear pink when it first debuted in 1959, wearing, instead, a black and white chevron bathing suit. "The world truly made the pink connection with Barbie in the '70s when we started consistently leaning into predominantly pink packaging as a core brand identifier," said Kim Culmone, senior vice president and head of Barbie and fashion doll design for Mattel. Barbie's pink shades evolved over the years, and in 2008 the vibrant "Barbie Pink" became an official Pantone color.
With Barbie in the air, brands are seizing the moment. Following last year's collaboration with Mattel to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Barbie Dreamhouse, the furniture company Joybird is partnering with the toymaker on another collection that includes sofas and accent chairs in a deep jewel pink tone set to release in July.
Gifty Walker, Joybird's director of merchandising and sourcing in Los Angeles, noted that Joybird had a hot pink couch that was popular in 2016. Now hot pink is back and customers are using it to eschew traditional neutrals like grays, browns, and tans. "Once, those bolder colors were reserved for pillows and rugs and just the décor accents, and now we see people really making them an anchor piece in the room," said Ms. Walker.
For Jasmine Mitchell, a 30-year-old model, decorating with hot pink allowed her to connect with her inner child. When she moved from Dallas to Los Angeles in 2021 she designed her living room around the color. The first item she purchased for her apartment's living room was a velvet hot pink accent chair with gold legs. LED lights surrounding the windows cast a pink glow in the evening.
"I like the other pinks, but hot pink just does something. It's electrifying. It makes me so happy and makes me feel alive," Ms. Mitchell said. "So I kind of let my younger self guide me." Beverly Griffith painted her Nashville house, built in 1915, three shades of pink at the start of the pandemic. Below, from left: colors like Ken by Eaton House Studios and In the Pink by Sherwin-Williams give Ms. Griffith's kitchen a Barbiecore boost; and Ms. Griffith's primary bathroom is replete with tile, a tub and a shower curtain in vibrant rosy hues.

Shahzada Dawood, 48, Father and Businessman: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Dawood, a British Pakistani businessman, was the vice chairman of Engro Corporation, a conglomerate owned by one of the richest families in Pakistan.
Shahzada Dawood, a British Pakistani businessman who was among the five people aboard a submersible journeying deep into the Altantic to view the Titanic, was killed when the vessel imploded during its descent to the ocean floor, the authorities said Thursday. He was 48.
His 19-year-old son, Suleman, who was with him on the Titan submersible, was also killed.
Mr. Dawood was the vice chairman of Engro Corporation, a business conglomerate headquartered in the Pakistani port city of Karachi that is involved in agriculture, energy and telecommunications. His family is known as one of the wealthiest business families in the country.
His work focused on renewable energy and technology, according to a statement from his family.
Mr. Dawood was born on Feb. 12, 1975, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. He studied law as an undergraduate at Buckingham University in Britain and later received a master's degree in global textile marketing from Philadelphia University, now part of Thomas Jefferson University. In 2012, he was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.
His son was a business student at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow and had just completed his first year, a spokesman for the school said. Like his father, he was a fan of science fiction and enjoyed solving Rubik's Cubes and playing volleyball, according to a statement from Engro.
"The relationship between Shahzada and Suleman was a joy to behold; they were each other's greatest supporters and cherished a shared passion for adventure and exploration of all the world had to offer them," the family's statement said.
The pair's shared passion for science and discovery, friends and family said, led them to embark on the expedition to the wreck of the Titanic.
Travel and science were "part of his DNA," said Ahsen Uddin Syed, a friend of the elder Mr. Dawood who used to work with him at Engro.
A lover of "Star Trek" and "Star Wars," Mr. Dawood was also fond of nature and often traveled to faraway places and shared pictures of his adventures, Mr. Sayed said.
His Instagram profile is like a memory book of his love of travel and nature; it is blanketed with photos of birds, flowers and landscapes, including a sunset in the Kalahari Desert, the ice sheet in Greenland, penguins in the Shetlands and a tiny bird in London with the caption "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."
"Don't adventures ever have an end?" Mr. Dawood wrote in a Facebook post last year from a trip to Iceland, quoting Bilbo Baggins from "The Fellowship of the Ring." "I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story."
Khalid Mansoor, another former colleague of Mr. Dawood's, said that Mr. Dawood was a passionate champion of the environment. He was also a trustee at the SETI Institute, an organization devoted to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
In his role at Engro, the company statement said, Mr. Dawood advocated "a culture of learning, sustainability and diversity." He was also involved in his family's charitable ventures, including the Engro Foundation, which supports small-scale farmers, and the Dawood Foundation, an education-focused nonprofit.
"Shahzada's and Suleman's absence will be felt deeply by all those who had the privilege of knowing this pair," his family's statement read.
Mr. Dawood is survived by a daughter, Alina, and his wife, Christine.

Modi's Visits Abroad Help to Bolster His Image: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For an audience in India, the prime minister is linking his diplomatic reception abroad, and himself, to the country's growing importance on the world stage.
His grip on the levers of national power secure, his hold on India's domestic imagination cemented, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increasingly turned to advancing himself on a new horizon: the global stage.
With a packed diplomatic calendar that includes India's hosting of the Group of 20 summit later this year, Mr. Modi is building an image going into his re-election campaign as a leader who can win respect and investment for his vast nation. The state visit accorded to Mr. Modi in Washington, which ends on Friday, is perhaps the biggest prize yet in that quest.
"It's not just about a fairer bargain abroad," said Ashok Malik, a former government adviser who is the India chair at the Asia Group, a consulting firm. "It's also that 'my investments in key foreign policy relations are actually helping to build the Indian economy and therefore create opportunities for Indians at home and strengthen India overall."'
At home, Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist party has continued to sideline institutions that were once important checks on the government. It has persisted in its vilification of the country's 200 million Muslims, even as Mr. Modi used an exceedingly rare news conference in Washington to claim that there was no discrimination against anyone in India.
But abroad, world leaders eager to court an ascendant India have offered little pushback. And often, they have given Mr. Modi invaluable fodder for an information campaign that shapes perceptions of him among many Indian voters who are ecstatic to see their country's importance affirmed.
When Mr. Modi traveled to Australia last month, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese referred to him as "the boss" in front of an arena in Sydney packed with about 20,000 people. Mr. Modi then returned to New Delhi to a large crowd gathered for his welcome at 6 in the morning, telling supporters that the grand welcome for him abroad was about India, not him.
On Friday, as Mr. Modi was wrapping up his meetings in the United States before arriving in Egypt for another grand greeting, his political party and the large sections of the broadcast media friendly to him reveled in the reception he had gotten from President Biden and other American leaders.
The red carpet in Washington played perfectly into one of Mr. Modi's talents: He can build a media campaign out of virtually anything, projecting himself as the only leader who can expand India's economy and usher a nation coming into its own to new heights.
While opposition leaders back home were holding their largest gathering yet, hoping to find a formula for uniting to challenge the prime minister in elections early next year, Mr. Modi was reaching for the world.
Social media was flooded with montage videos, set to regal background music, of Mr. Modi making a grand entrance into the House of Representatives for his address to a joint session of Congress. The speech, after which several lawmakers sought Mr. Modi's autograph, made him one of only a very small number of world leaders to have addressed that body twice.
Another video online kept count of the number of times Mr. Modi received applause or standing ovations during his speech. A third cut to dramatic images of Mr. Modi contrasting him with the dynastic leaders who came before him, advancing a constant narrative that he represents a subversion of the old elite that long ruled India.
"History tells us that powerful people come from powerful places. History was wrong," a deep voice intones in the video. "Powerful people make places powerful."
Mr. Modi's next major opportunity to appear as a global statesman will come in September when India welcomes the Group of 20 leaders, a summit meeting he has framed to his support base as his bringing the world to India.
His government has turned promotion for the meeting into a roadshow, hosting hundreds of G20 events, so many that foreign diplomats in New Delhi quietly complain about travel fatigue. Cities and towns across India are decked out with billboards bearing the G20 logo -- which cleverly incorporates the lotus, a symbol both of India and his Bharatiya Janata Party -- and pictures of Mr. Modi.
In promoting the G20 presidency, Mr. Modi has taken to frequently describing India, the world's most populous nation, as the "mother of democracy." Abroad, however, he has pursued a transactional brand of diplomacy built not on practicing democratic values, but on what best serves Indian economic and security interests, and what elevates India in the world.
The image of "a rising India, a new India being seen more seriously abroad" helps Mr. Modi politically, Mr. Malik said. But Mr. Modi is also investing heavily in U.S. relations with an eye toward how they could help an Indian economy that is struggling to create enough jobs for its huge young population and that must put up a fight against an aggressive China next door.
"Addressing China is not just about soldiers and weapons at the border, it's also about building economic alternatives to what China offers," Mr. Malik said.
The list of agreements between the United States and India, announced at the end of a bilateral meeting at the White House, was long, covering defense, space and a wide range of technological cooperation.
Defense cooperation, in particular -- including deals on Indian manufacturing of General Electric jet engines and purchasing Predator military drones -- received a major boost after what had been a history of reluctance and bureaucratic hurdles on both sides.
Dr. Tara Kartha, a former senior official in India's security council who dealt with U.S. on defense, said the agreement on aircraft engines was "an affirmation of trust" that would help the military partnership beyond the smaller steps of the past two decades.
"Each country is trying to get past its bureaucratic constrains," she said. "Until the bureaucracy can catch up, there will be frustrations."
Among ordinary Indians on the streets of New Delhi, opinions of Mr. Modi's diplomatic efforts were divided.
Vijay Yadav, a 26-year-old taxi driver, said Mr. Modi's outreach abroad could not cover for how India's economy was struggling to create enough jobs.
"I saw on Instagram a news feed which was constantly touting Mr. Modi's trip to America as if no other Indian leader had been there before," he said. "Firstly, he must get down to solving the problems of his own countrymen before he goes abroad to project himself as a hero."
Nidhi Garg, 41, who has inherited a vegetable and fruit shop from her father, said her heart swelled each time she saw Mr. Modi representing India abroad.
"Today, wherever you see, the name of our nation is being taken," she said. "The first thing that comes to anyone's mind when they mention the word India, they immediately connect it to Prime Minister Modi."

Microsoft Could Abandon Its Deal With Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A five-day hearing over Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition, which the Federal Trade Commission hopes to block, began Thursday in federal court.
The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal's closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
"This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward," said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft's lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a "three-year administrative nightmare" that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision -- and its popular games like Call of Duty -- would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
"If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud," James Weingarten, the F.T.C.'s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft's $ 7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision's games into Microsoft's portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty -- an enormous franchise that has earned more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.
Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game's revenue. She said Sony had become the "complainer in chief" in the case, and showed an email from Sony's chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft's bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley's courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.
Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition.

Like Spider-Woman With a Crochet Hook: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: In "My Neighbor's Garden," an installation at Madison Square Park, Sheila Pepe uses the humble art of crochet to shape space and build community.
"My favorite thing is crocheting 20 feet in the air," the artist Sheila Pepe said at her studio in the Brooklyn Army Terminal. There across the floor last month she was laying out coils of vibrantly colored shoelaces, paracord, rope and garden hose, more than 15,000 yards' worth, to be strung and spun into her first outdoor installation, opening on June 26 in Manhattan's Madison Square Park.
"Up high, in my overalls and my crochet hook in hand, on top of a drivable scissor lift, it's the funniest gender joke in the world for me," said the 63-year-old artist, who identifies as lesbian. "Now you're Grandma! Now you're Uncle Joe!"
For more than two decades, Pepe has used the craft of crochet, which she learned as a child from her mother, as a way to "draw" in three dimensions and infiltrate architecture. Her handmade, unruly webs, which she attaches to museum walls and ceilings in large-scale ephemeral installations, soar and sag -- challenging long-held ideas about monumentality in sculpture.
Using crochet in place of steel, Pepe has invited reconsideration of a humble craft done by generations of women and the painstaking labor that went into it. "I couldn't grow up where I did," she said, without recognizing the invisibility of unsung work by her own family, which immigrated from Italy in the early 20th century. Her grandfather ran a shoe repair shop in Brooklyn, and her parents owned a deli in Morristown, N.J.
Now, she is bringing her cheerfully subversive form of women's work to a public park with her exhibition "My Neighbor's Garden."
At the northern end of Madison Square Park, Pepe has suspended strips of crocheted material, measuring as long as 95 feet, from the tops of eight existing lampposts and eight 20-foot-tall telephone poles newly planted around the lawn and walkways. She has built these festive gateways and canopies in a ravishing palette of pinks, oranges, reds and purples. Around each pole, vining flowers and vegetable plants are climbing toward the sun on cords strung from the pole tops, and are ultimately expected to entwine with Pepe's garlands of crochet fiber.
"I do have this fantasy that the plants overtake the crochet, that it just goes haywire," said Pepe, who drew inspiration from the gardens -- some lush, some funky -- sprouting from front yards, community plots and concrete slabs in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where she lives with her wife, the painter Carrie Moyer.
The sheer volume of material needed to make an impact outdoors required Pepe, who typically does all her own crocheting, to scale up her studio practice. "I never wanted an art factory," said Pepe, who instead has recruited and gathered small, lively groups of friends and strangers alike to crochet together to help produce the installation.
"There is something about a crocheting circle, where stitches are shared," Pepe said -- along with "information that might be useful."
This practice taps into the long history of women convening, under cover of creating craft, to talk about the issues of the day, said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, artistic director and chief curator at the Madison Square Park Conservancy. "These sewing circles and knitting clubs and quilting bees were forums to talk about women's rights, to propel the abolition of slavery, to create garments and blankets sold to provide income," Rapaport said. "That inspires Sheila."
Lauren Filipink, a high school history teacher at the Brooklyn Latin School, had never heard of Pepe when she responded to an Instagram post by Madison Square Park looking for crocheters of any gender or ability. She was one of 23 women ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s who showed up at the artist's studio across several Saturdays to crochet long chains of Day-Glo-colored shoelaces with oversize hooks. (Each was paid $ 50 a day.)
"There was something sort of magical that happened as we were chatting away as we worked," Filipink said. Pepe gave basic parameters on the crochet stitch and length she wanted, and in the course of the afternoon a reporter witnessed, any initial reserve between participants quickly fell away. The communal freewheeling conversation barreled through topics from most embarrassing email addresses to disco naps.
Filipink, a prodigious crocheter who personally processed several thousand yards for the project, said she likes how it is a disruption -- "taking a very indoor craft relegated to the women's sphere and turning it outdoors."
Pepe also enlisted the help of five friends from what she calls her "power queer group," including the theater maker Moe Angelos. With "My Neighbor's Garden," Pepe is building community, Angelos said. "In a city, you have a little pea patch and the people next to you have their little pea patch and you talk across the fence," she added. "Community is a very threadbare word right now, but the connection is real."
Growing up within the confines of her traditional family, Pepe described the future her mother envisioned for her as one of limited options: bank teller, nurse, teacher, nun. Instead, Pepe opted for art, completing a degree in ceramics in 1983 at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. There, she also realized she was a lesbian. After graduation, she rejected the idea of a career in the art world -- living for much of the next decade in a community of separatist feminists and working at a lesbian-run restaurant in Alston and later on a farm in western Massachusetts.
"I learned that being a separatist, like being in the Catholic Church, was way too dogmatic for me," said Pepe, who eventually found her way back to art making, working first at the Smith College Museum of Art, and then getting her M.F.A., in 1995, at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts in Boston.
Initially, crochet was just part of her grab bag of media, which included ceramics, carved wood and found objects melded in sculptures that Pepe began exhibiting in the late 1990s. (She continues to make eclectic tabletop sculptures in her studio today.)
She mounted her first large-scale crocheted installation in 2001 at Grinnell College in Iowa, combining industrial-size rubber bands with men's shoelaces, tied end to end, in homage to her grandfather's shoemaking trade. "Then it just grew and grew," said Pepe, who does not have gallery representation, accepting commissions directly from the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Des Moines Art Center, among other institutions.
In 2017, the curator Gilbert Vicario organized her midcareer survey at the Phoenix Art Museum, which he titled "Sheila Pepe: Hot Mess Formalism" -- a reference to the simultaneous beauty and chaos of her installations. "When you first walk in, your eye goes all over the place," said Vicario, who is now chief curator at the Pérez Art Museum Miami. "People have different reactions, always visceral."
Earlier this week, mid-installation at Madison Square Park, Pepe was in her happy place. Up in the bucket of the scissor lift, she maneuvered through her huge cat's cradle, cinching lines and crocheting them with larger stitched panels to create dense splashes of color among the trees.
"Ninety-nine percent of the actual piece happens on site," Pepe said, surveying the many months' worth of chunky crocheted chains and shapes that resemble mandalas laid out on tarps over the grass. "It's like three-dimensional chess."
Over the course of the exhibition, which runs through Dec. 10, Pepe will convene makers informally under the big tent of "My Neighbor's Garden" as part of the public programming.
While crochet, and craft generally, is no longer on the periphery of the art world, Pepe still finds the medium a useful way to initiate conversations on a spectrum of ideas -- from marginalization to optimism, it's all on the menu.
"Did I think I would be still doing this 20 years later? No," she said. But when invited to the party, she brings her gifts. "It's like my best Bundt cake."

Amazon Traps Users in Service, Regulator Says: [National Desk]

Full text: The lawsuit is the first time that the Federal Trade Commission under its chair, Lina Khan, has taken Amazon to court.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing it of illegally inducing consumers to sign up for its Prime service and then hindering them from canceling the subscription, in the most aggressive action against the company to date by the agency's chair, Lina Khan.
In its lawsuit, the F.T.C. argued that Amazon had "duped millions of consumers" into enrolling in Prime by using "manipulative, coercive or deceptive" design tactics on its website known as "dark patterns." And when consumers wanted to cancel, Amazon "knowingly complicated" the process with byzantine procedures.
"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money," Ms. Khan said in a statement.
Amazon said in a statement that the F.T.C.'s "claims are false on the facts and the law" and that "by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership." The company accused the F.T.C. of filing the lawsuit without advance notice, while the two sides were still in conversation about the case.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, takes aim at a key Amazon program that has become ubiquitous in the lives of more than 200 million customers. Prime members pay $ 139 a year to get packages shipped faster from Amazon's retail store, to stream movies and series from its in-house studio and to receive discounts when they check out at Amazon's Whole Foods grocery chain. The company has added more perks to Prime over time, including live sports, and has raised the annual subscription fee.
The F.T.C.'s action was the first time that the agency took Amazon to court under Ms. Khan, who rose to fame with a viral critique of the company and who is ramping up scrutiny of the e-commerce giant. Ms. Khan has said the power that big tech companies exert over online commerce requires regulators to be far more aggressive, and she has taken actions against them.
Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. continued a lawsuit against Meta, the owner of Facebook, arguing that it cut off nascent competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency also sued to block Microsoft's blockbuster $ 69 billion deal for the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
Ms. Khan has yet to bring the kind of sweeping antitrust case against Amazon that the company's critics have demanded. The F.T.C.'s antitrust bureau has investigated Amazon's practices for years, and critics and supporters of the company are closely watching to see how she will move forward with the findings.
Amazon recently settled cases with the F.T.C. that began before Ms. Khan's tenure. The company agreed to pay $ 25 million last month to settle commission claims that its Alexa home assistant devices had illegally collected children's data. The company also settled another privacy case with the F.T.C. over its Ring home security subsidiary.
The new lawsuit is part of a larger effort by regulators to limit the power of tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. The Department of Justice has in recent years filed multiple antitrust cases against Google. European regulators have also scrutinized behemoth tech companies, passing privacy laws, working on proposals to rein in artificial intelligence and filing charges against Google and others.
Prime has for years attracted subscribers with its menu of benefits, turning the service into one of the keys to Amazon's dominance. The service was introduced in 2005 for $ 79 a year. Over time, the company added more perks to the program, like streaming video, and increased the price. It raised the fee to $ 139 a year in 2022.
In 2021, Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members. Customers last year spent $ 35 billion on Amazon subscriptions, primarily Prime memberships, according to the company's financial disclosures.
On Wednesday, the F.T.C. said Amazon had made it particularly difficult to buy a product in its store without also subscribing to Prime while checking out. In one example, it said, the company used "repetition and color" to push customers' focus to Prime's promise of free shipping and away from the service's price, leading some to subscribe to Prime without "informed consent."
The agency also said Amazon made it hard to find the page that allowed consumers to cancel the service. Once they found it, the company bombarded them with offers intended to change their mind. The lawsuit said Amazon had named the process for canceling Prime after the Iliad, the lengthy Greek epic poem that recounts the Trojan War.
Amazon "substantially revamped its Prime cancellation process for at least some subscribers" shortly before the lawsuit, the heavily redacted complaint said. But "prior to that time, the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them."
The F.T.C. asked the court to stop Amazon from engaging in those practices and to force the company to pay an unspecified financial penalty.
Questions over how hard it is to cancel Prime have increased in recent years. In a 2021 complaint to the District of Columbia attorney general, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, said Amazon used manipulative designs to "frustrate the intentions of users who intend to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions."
The F.T.C. has recently pledged to crack down on designs meant to nudge consumers or confound their efforts to cancel a service.
"It's having to play a lot of catch-up because these practices have evolved for many years without serious attention and enforcement," said John Davisson, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "Going after a company as big as Amazon is sending a message to other players in the industry."
Critics consider Prime central to Amazon's business because it keeps customers inside the company's retail store by offering them other perks, like access to Amazon streaming exclusives like "Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power."
Amazon has said Prime provides benefits for consumers. When the company lobbied in recent years against changes to antitrust laws focused on the tech giants, it regularly told lawmakers and the media that the changes would hobble Prime.
Ms. Khan's next steps on Amazon will be closely watched. She rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in The Yale Law Journal when she was a Yale law student. That paper, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," argued that modern interpretations of antitrust law should be widened to address tech companies like Amazon, effectively upending decades of established antitrust doctrine.
"As Amazon continues both to deepen its existing control over key infrastructure and to reach into new lines of business, its dominance demands the same scrutiny," she wrote.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing it of illegally inducing consumers to sign up for its Prime service and then hindering them from canceling the subscription, in the most aggressive action against the company to date by the agency’s chair, Lina Khan.
In its lawsuit, the FTC argued that Amazon had “duped millions of consumers” into enrolling in Prime by using “manipulative, coercive or deceptive” design tactics on its website known as “dark patterns.” And when consumers wanted to cancel, Amazon “knowingly complicated” the process with byzantine procedures.
“Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,” Khan said in a statement.
Amazon said in a statement that the FTC’s “claims are false on the facts and the law” and that “by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership.” The company accused the FTC of filing the lawsuit without advance notice while the two sides were still in conversation about the case.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, takes aim at a key Amazon program that has become ubiquitous in the lives of more than 200 million customers. Prime members pay $139 a year to get packages shipped faster from Amazon’s retail store, to stream movies and series from its in-house studio and to receive discounts when they check out at Amazon’s Whole Foods grocery chain. The company has added more perks to Prime over time, including live sports, and has raised the annual subscription fee.
The FTC’s action was the first time that the agency took Amazon to court under Khan, who rose to fame with a viral critique of the company and who is ramping up scrutiny of the e-commerce giant. Khan has said the power that big tech companies exert over online commerce requires regulators to be far more aggressive, and she has taken actions against them.
Under Khan, the FTC continued a lawsuit against Meta, the owner of Facebook, arguing that it cut off nascent competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency also sued to block Microsoft’s blockbuster $69 billion deal for the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
Khan has yet to bring the kind of sweeping antitrust case against Amazon that the company’s critics have demanded. The FTC’s antitrust bureau has investigated Amazon’s practices for years, and critics and supporters of the company are closely watching to see how she will move forward with the findings.
Amazon recently settled cases with the FTC that began before Khan’s tenure. The company agreed to pay $25 million last month to settle commission claims that its Alexa home assistant devices had illegally collected children’s data. The company also settled another privacy case with the FTC over its Ring home security subsidiary.

The Black-Owned Restaurants of Bed-Stuy: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Watching in real time as a neighborhood changes while trying to cling to its identity.
There's nothing better than finding your neighborhood in New York City. The place where you feel the most comfortable in your skin, where you feel immersed in the community and held close by its warmth. For me, as a Black woman, that is Bed-Stuy, where I've lived since 2015.
The Times would have me render it with the full name, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, but to me it is decidedly Bed-Stuy.
This is the best way I can illustrate how my section of this historically Black community has grown and changed: Along the first street I lived on, the trees were young and spindly, barely able to provide shade at the height of summer. Eight years later, they're taller and stronger, with lush canopies.
The restaurant scene has grown more lush, too. I remember when the only option near my apartment was BKLYN Blend, the Black-owned smoothie shop and restaurant. In the years since, it has taken over a small storefront next door and added a coconut stand.
I've watched as Tompkins Avenue has flourished into a rich collection of shops, bars and restaurants. On summer Sundays, when Open Streets shuts off the avenue to cars, it can become a party.
The neighborhood is teeming with Black-owned businesses. On Tompkins, the center of the action is the stretch between the coffee shop Sincerely, Tommy and the bar Bed-Vyne Brew. (On weekends, you can eat jerk chicken fresh off the grill from a vendor right outside Bed-Vyne.) The newish Brown Butter Creamery sits between them; its sister restaurant, Brown Butter Craft Bar & Kitchen, is down the street.
Nearby there's the family-owned Doctor's Cave Café. The menu changes constantly, and it's always good. The Council, on Nostrand Avenue, comes from the folks behind the Nigerian restaurant Dept of Culture, and makes a nice quick breakfast if you're looking for one. The Royal Rib House, open since 1968, might be one of the closest things Bed-Stuy has to a legacy restaurant.
That richness didn't happen by accident; it was created with purpose. During the restless summer of 2020, I would pass signs in the neighborhood reading, "What if Bed-Stuy was a Black utopia?" As a transplant, I feared it was a dream that maybe I didn't have the right to cling to, but wanted to nonetheless.
This spring, while looking for a new apartment, I realized how much change had taken place. Not just in the ever-rising rents but in this neighborhood's increasing appeal to people who have been priced out of neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Clinton Hill. I might qualify as someone who has contributed to the gentrification of Bed-Stuy, but I also look like I belong.
I was terrified that I might be priced out of that utopian dream. But I found a rent-stabilized apartment blocks away from my old place. I'm incredibly thankful.
I often find myself filled with anxiety. When a new restaurant or business opens in this corner of Bed-Stuy, I wonder: Is it Black-owned? If not, are the owners forming relationships and engaging with the Black community? Are they hiring people who reflect the neighborhood's history?
I sometimes see self-imposed segregation: One neighborhood split into two. Walk up Lewis Avenue past Peaches on a weekend morning and it's spilling over with Black and brown customers. Two and a half blocks up at Saraghina Pizzeria, it's a different story. I flit between both, depending on my cravings, but I feel a need to protect one.
Yes, I want to live in a Black utopia -- and in some respects, I already do. I'm creating it for myself by living here. I want the trees of Bed-Stuy to continue to grow fuller, but I don't want curb appeal to come at the expense of the neighborhood's identity.
I want to feel enveloped in Blackness without worrying that it is at risk. I want to hide this neighborhood away; I want everyone to know how special it is.

Full text: Taking a stroll with someone is a wonderful way to strengthen your social connections.
Note: As the smoke from Canadian wildfires continues to cover parts of the U.S., it may be unhealthy to walk outside. If you're in an affected area, please save this advice for later and stay safe.
Hello, fellow (and aspiring) walkers! This is the second installment of our monthlong newsletter series dedicated to the joys of ambling outdoors. This week, we're walking and talking, taking a stroll with someone -- a friend, a family member, a neighbor or a partner -- to deepen our sense of connection.
Some of my most rewarding conversations have happened while on foot. The exchanges seemed to flow more easily, as if our steps were setting the tempo for our speech. But there may be a simpler reason that walks draw people out: Research shows that it can be less stressful to talk to someone when you're walking side by side, with minimal eye contact, than conversing face to face.
"When walking next to someone, a conversation becomes parallel play," with each person "looking ahead yet connected by the exchange," said Esther Perel, a couples therapist, author and host of the podcast "Where Should We Begin?"
To help you get the most out of your walking chats, I sought advice from Perel and Priya Parker, the author of "The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters."
Consider a theme.
Think about the sort of conversation you'd like to have ahead of time, Parker advised. If you're feeling creative, you may even want to give it a title, she said. Parker suggested four:
Wander Walk: Choose a neighborhood or park you've never explored and "wander together and talk about things that don't normally come up in everyday life," Parker said.
Memory Lane: On this walk, talk about important memories that the other person may not know.
Struggle Stroll: You and your companion can take an opportunity to share something you've been struggling with "and just listen to one another, no advice, just deep listening," Parker said.
Walk and Talk: No need to structure your chats; simply meet for movement instead of sitting at a bar, restaurant or someone's home. "We walk and we talk, about anything and everything," Parker said.
Or prep a few prompts.
Walking invites easy conversation because we're often more relaxed and open to tangents, Parker explained. "And it's really hard to check your phone incessantly when you're on a walk with someone else," she said. "You'll trip."
There's no pressure to come up with thought-provoking questions -- simply spending time together on a ramble, away from screens and obligations, builds bonds. But prompts can make a walk more fun. Perel, a master of getting people to open up, offered a few reliable ones (some from the upcoming version of her card game, "Where Should We Begin: A Game of Stories") to engage people in more thought-provoking discussions:
What's a promise you wish you hadn't broken?
The trip that changed my life was ...
The thing that's keeping me up at night is ...
If my younger self could see me today, they would say ...
My most unexpected friendship is with ...
One of Parker's favorite ways to begin a dialogue is to ask: "Have you ever had a nemesis? Why do you think they got so under your skin?"
"This often leads to passionate, quite hilarious conversation," Parker said, adding that "it's slightly transgressive, slightly naughty."
Embrace the flow of conversation.
When we're walking with another person, Parker said, the social norms around silence and talking tend to shift. "It's OK to take a beat, which is its own kind of intimacy," she said. "Some of the best and most random conversations often happen after long periods of silence."
And if you're in need of a walking companion, consider joining a group. GirlTrek is a network of over one million Black women who connect to walk in neighborhoods around the country. EverWalk, a national initiative co-founded by the swimmer Diana Nyad, organizes walking events, clubs and challenges.
Meet Martinus Evans, a beloved figure among runners in the back of the pack.
The Slow AF Run Club, a virtual running group for people who have felt left out of the sport, was founded by Martinus Evans. He began running in 2012, after an orthopedic surgeon told him to "lose weight or die," and laughed at Evans's vow to run a marathon. Evans, now a certified running coach, has since run eight.

Expressing gratitude feels good -- but it's also a powerful way to improve your well-being.
Research suggests that a grateful outlook has been shown to have positive effects on our psychological health -- and even our physical health. Regularly expressing gratitude helps connect us more closely with others, too. An easy way to build gratitude, one expert said, is to link it to a daily habit, like thinking of what you're grateful for as you turn on your computer.

Judge Judy Expands Fief On Amazon: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2021, Judge Judith Sheindlin, the razor-tongued court show star, decamped from the dying medium of daytime broadcast syndication and joined Amazon for a streaming-era experiment.
Fewer people were watching traditional daytime television, including programs like "Judge Judy." Was it because they were tired of the content? Or was the decline -- as Amazon suspected -- more about convenience and the delivery route? To find out, the company hired Judge Sheindlin to produce and star in a new court show, "Judy Justice," and made it available on Freevee, a little-known, free streaming service supported by advertising.
"It was a risk," Judge Sheindlin recalled over lunch this month, "but one that intrigued me."
"Judy Justice" quickly became Freevee's No. 1 original show, racking up more than 150 million hours watched over two years, according to Amazon, and recently prompting the company to give Judge Sheindlin, 80, two spinoff shows and a fourth unscripted show that is still under wraps. Some people inside Amazon Studios, which is in Culver City, Calif., have been jokingly referring to Judge Sheindlin's programming expansion as the Judy-Verse, a play on the interconnected stories of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
As she builds a mini empire at Amazon, Judge Sheindlin is also adding to what has become known as the Nepo-Verse. (Insert an irritated roll of her eyes about that sentence.) Nepotism has always been prevalent in Hollywood, but lately the number of actors, directors, singers and reality stars who have benefited from family connections has become startlingly large. New York magazine deemed 2022 "the year of the nepo baby."
Judge Sheindlin's granddaughter Sarah Rose appears as a law clerk on "Judy Justice," which Amazon recently renewed for two more seasons. ("I've gotten more comfortable in front of the camera and more comfortable interrupting -- in a respectful way -- to share my perspective," Sarah Rose said.) A spinoff, "Tribunal Justice," with cases adjudicated by three legal professionals, one of whom is Judge Sheindlin's son Adam Levy, arrived on Freevee last Friday. New episodes will roll out each weekday through December.
The coming series "Justice on Trial" will examine landmark court cases, in part through re-enactment, and feature Daniel T. Mentzer, a criminal defense lawyer in New York City who happens to be married to one of Judge Sheindlin's daughters. One hourlong episode will focus on the 1925 Scopes trial, in which a science teacher was prosecuted for informing students about Darwin's theory of evolution. "More relevant today than ever," Judge Sheindlin said of Scopes, pointing to Florida's ban on classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Judge Sheindlin and Amazon declined to discuss the fourth show, which is in development for release on Freevee sometime next year.
"Judge Sheindlin is a brand," said Lauren Anderson, the head of original programming for Amazon's ad-supported streaming operation. "It's not as if we are saying we want 20 other court shows. But we are always listening when she's pitching something."
Freevee is on a courtroom roll. The service, which used to be called IMDb TV, is also home to "Jury Duty," a hit documentary-sitcom in which an unsuspecting man unwittingly participates in a staged trial among actors. Free, ad-supported streaming platforms -- others include Pluto TV, Tubi and Roku Channel -- have become one of the fastest-growing areas in media, in part because some subscription streaming services have been raising prices, prompting cost-conscious viewers to seek alternatives.
But Judge Sheindlin remains a main attraction. As for casting family members in her shows, she suggested that anyone who didn't like it could pound sand. "I wouldn't bring in someone, support someone, unless they were terrific," she said. "End of story."
Judge Sheindlin took a bite of rigatoni Bolognese, and this reporter tried again: Why was her son Adam the best possible option for the third "Tribunal Justice" adjudicator?
"Look, everybody wants to be in the entertainment business -- it's glamorous," she said. "But not everybody has the ability to connect with an audience and have legal credibility. Adam is a meticulous lawyer with a personality."
Perhaps a "Kardashians"-style reality show could be next, a reporter offered dryly. She batted that idea away, joking that it would consist of her and her husband, Jerry Sheindlin, 89, watching "Jeopardy!" He shouts out the answers, she added, with a hint of annoyance. (He apparently also enjoys scrolling Instagram. "Horses," she said with a sigh. "Nothing but horses.")
"Tribunal Justice" pairs Mr. Levy, a former district attorney for Putnam County in New York, with the monarchal Justice Patricia DiMango, who stepped down from the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 2014, and Tanya Acker, a Yale-educated civil litigator. Justice DiMango and Ms. Acker previously starred on "Hot Bench," a show created by Judge Sheindlin that continues in syndication.
"The elephant in the room is nepotism," Mr. Levy said pre-emptively at the start of an interview at his Beverly Hills hotel. "If Judy was not the creator and executive producer, I would not be here. I know that. But putting that aside for a minute, I know that I am good at what I do in a courtroom."
He continued, "I worked too hard to develop my reputation as a lawyer, as someone of substance who really does respect the law and the judicial process, to be diminished that way."
Mr. Levy, 54, started his career in the early 1990s as a Long Island prosecutor. A decade ago, while serving as the Putnam County district attorney, he became enmeshed in a nasty feud with a local sheriff who accused him of interfering in a rape investigation. Mr. Levy denied any wrongdoing and sued for defamation. He won, with the sheriff forced to apologize for lying and pay $ 150,000.
The judges on most court shows do not examine piles of evidence before hearing a case. (Once you've adjudicated one dog-grooming incident gone wrong, you've sort of adjudicated them all.) Mr. Levy, however, has refused to operate that way on "Tribunal Justice," pressing producers for voluminous paperwork and forcing Justice DiMango and Ms. Acker to up their game, Judge Sheindlin said.
One early "Tribunal Justice" episode featured a sunburned defendant, Brenda Biever, who was accused of absconding with $ 760 worth of property. Mr. Levy started out with soft questions. But his demeanor turned on a dime when he seemed to catch the plaintiff in a lie.
"Stop!" he shouted. "You show me some evidence! Right now!"
As part of her recent deal-making with Amazon, Judge Sheindlin will continue to star on "Judy Justice" until at least 2025, when she will be 82. Has she started to think about passing the baton?
"The short answer is yes," she said. "But it's not just passing a baton." She wants her worldview to continue to be reflected, she said. "Like me, Adam is a personal responsibility person," she said.
In a separate interview, Mr. Levy spoke about his style.
"If someone comes into a courtroom and lies or exaggerates or does something they're not supposed to, I want to make sure they leave there embarrassed and humiliated to make it less likely they will do that again," he said.

Full text: "Hey, we're still here": At a time when Black families have been leaving New York, the weekend celebration cultivated a sense of community.
All afternoon, people lined up for Shelly Flash's specialties: jerk cheese nachos and jerk chicken dinner tacos -- that's chicken, coconut rice, black beans, sweet plantains, pickled slaw, chipotle aioli and jerk sour cream inside a soft tortilla.
They were not disappointed.
The Jamaican taco business, 2 Girls & a Cookshop, is owned by Ms. Flash, 40, and her daughter, Jataun. Their fans (some of whom know Ms. Flash from the TV show "MasterChef") find out where they will be selling her food on Instagram and via word of mouth, since the Flash family doesn't yet have a restaurant of its own. Ms. Flash was a schoolteacher before the pandemic but last year decided to make food a full-time gig, she said. "I was just like, 'What would it look like if I gave me a shot?"'
Ms. Flash and 27 other Black food vendors at the weekend's Juneteenth Food Festival at the Weeksville Heritage Center in Brooklyn were actively fostering community at a time when many Black families have been leaving the city, drawn to regions where the cost of living is not as high and housing is more affordable. The city's Black population has declined by nearly 200,000 people in the past two decades.
"I've lived in Brooklyn for 17 years now, and it's just changed so much," said DJ Monday Blue, who was playing a mix of house music, disco, Afrobeats and soul. Yet she saw so much positivity and hope in the gathering. "I love this organization, focusing on the businesses and the Black people that are here and saying, 'Hey, we're still here."'
The food festival was organized by Black-Owned Brooklyn, an online publication documenting Black Brooklyn, and the vendors and customers were obviously passionate about delicious dishes. But all were also deeply appreciative of the bigger sense of connection -- both to their neighbors and to their history.
All around the green space, framed by flowers and trees, friends and generations of families tasted various cuisines together: cornbread, lobster rolls and burgers, food from the Caribbean and Ethiopia, red food and drink to especially mark the holiday.
Nicole Kidd, 36, sat on the grass under a shade tree with her 8-year-old daughter, Miela Jones, and her mother-in-law, Patricia Jones. She had purchased lunch from the Greedi Vegan stall and was eating the dessert first: banana pudding.
Ms. Kidd, born and raised in Brooklyn, didn't grow up knowing much about Juneteenth and its origins in Texas to mark the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. But, she said, "I'm excited that it is acknowledged now, and excited that it is celebrated."
In addition, there was a sense of reverence for Weeksville, which was a town of free Black people, founded shortly after New York abolished slavery in 1827.
Weeksville was once home to about 700 families. It had a school, a church and a newspaper. Just three homes from the town, known as the Hunterfly Road Houses, still stand on the site. They are now city landmarks and have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.
It wasn't Nkenge Walcott's first time at Weeksville -- she used to work at the school nearby. "We would often bring the kids here -- they didn't know how much history was in their own backyard," she said.
Ms. Walcott, 28, was accompanied by her 16-year-old niece, Isis Hughes, who wanted Ethiopian food. Together, they sought out Makina Cafe's bright yellow truck and ordered sambusa, a thin, flaky pastry stuffed with lentils, and tikel gomen, cabbage with carrots and potato in turmeric ginger sauce. Then Ms. Walcott headed over to GG's Fish and Chips With Soul for golden-brown strips of fried catfish and washed it all down with a red hibiscus drink. "I'm supporting my Spelman sister who owns Brooklyn Tea," Ms. Walcott said. "It's really, really, really great iced tea."
As the day wore on, visitors looked for sweets, lining up for mango popsicles from Island Pops and Caribbean vanilla ice cream from Crème and Cocoa Creamery.
But the true Juneteenth staple is red velvet cake.
Red foods, from strawberry soda to watermelon, are customary on Juneteenth, and Carmella Charrington, who was staffing the Doc's Cake Shop tent, was briskly selling pieces of red velvet cake, strawberry cake and a special green, black and red Juneteenth cake.
Although Ms. Charrington, 52, had grown up in Brooklyn, it was her first time at Weeksville, and she was in awe of the site.
"I had to walk through and just say thank you to my ancestors," she said. "We need to enjoy it, because that's what they would want us to do."

NEW YORK — All afternoon, people lined up for Shelly Flash’s specialties: jerk cheese nachos and jerk chicken dinner tacos — that’s chicken, coconut rice, black beans, sweet plantains, pickled slaw, chipotle aioli and jerk sour cream inside a soft tortilla.

Amazon’s Freevee Embraces the Judy-Verse

LOS ANGELES — In 2021, Judge Judith Sheindlin, the razor-tongued court show star, decamped from the dying medium of daytime broadcast syndication and joined Amazon for a streaming-era experiment.
Fewer people were watching traditional daytime television, including programs like “Judge Judy.” Was it because they were tired of the content? Or was the decline — as Amazon suspected — more about convenience and the delivery route? To find out, the company hired Sheindlin to produce and star in a new court show, “Judy Justice,” and made it available on Freevee, a little-known, free streaming service supported by advertising.
“It was a risk,” Sheindlin recalled over lunch this month, “but one that intrigued me.”
“Judy Justice” quickly became Freevee’s No. 1 original show, racking up more than 150 million hours watched over two years, according to Amazon, and recently prompting the company to give Sheindlin, 80, two spinoff shows and a fourth unscripted show that is still under wraps. Some people inside Amazon Studios, which is in Culver City, California, have been jokingly referring to Sheindlin’s programming expansion as the Judy-Verse, a play on the interconnected stories of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
As she builds a mini empire at Amazon, Sheindlin is also adding to what has become known as the Nepo-Verse. (Insert an irritated roll of her eyes about that sentence.) Nepotism has always been prevalent in Hollywood, but lately the number of actors, directors, singers and reality stars who have benefited from family connections has become startlingly large. New York magazine deemed 2022 “the year of the nepo baby.”
Sheindlin’s granddaughter Sarah Rose Levy appears as a law clerk on “Judy Justice,” which Amazon recently renewed for two more seasons. (“I’ve gotten more comfortable in front of the camera and more comfortable interrupting — in a respectful way — to share my perspective,” Levy said.) A spinoff, “Tribunal Justice,” with cases adjudicated by three legal professionals, one of whom is Sheindlin’s son Adam Levy, arrived on Freevee on June 9. New episodes will roll out each weekday through December.
The coming series “Justice on Trial” will examine landmark court cases, in part through reenactment, and feature Daniel T. Mentzer, a criminal defense lawyer in New York City who happens to be married to one of Sheindlin’s daughters. One hourlong episode will focus on the 1925 Scopes trial, in which a science teacher was prosecuted for informing students about Darwin’s theory of evolution. “More relevant today than ever,” Sheindlin said of Scopes, pointing to Florida’s ban on classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Sheindlin and Amazon declined to discuss the fourth show, which is in development for release on Freevee sometime next year.
“Judge Sheindlin is a brand,” said Lauren Anderson, the head of original programming for Amazon’s ad-supported streaming operation. “It’s not as if we are saying we want 20 other court shows. But we are always listening when she’s pitching something.”
Freevee is on a courtroom roll. The service, which used to be called IMDb TV, is also home to “Jury Duty,” a hit documentary-sitcom in which an unsuspecting man unwittingly participates in a staged trial among actors. Free, ad-supported streaming platforms — others include Pluto TV, Tubi and Roku Channel — have become one of the fastest-growing areas in media, in part because some subscription streaming services have been raising prices, prompting cost-conscious viewers to seek alternatives.
But Sheindlin remains a main attraction. As for casting family members in her shows, she suggested that anyone who didn’t like it could pound sand. “I wouldn’t bring in someone, support someone, unless they were terrific,” she said. “End of story.”
Sheindlin took a bite of rigatoni Bolognese, and this reporter tried again: Why was her son Adam the best possible option for the third “Tribunal Justice” adjudicator?
“Look, everybody wants to be in the entertainment business — it’s glamorous,” she said. “But not everybody has the ability to connect with an audience and have legal credibility. Adam is a meticulous lawyer with a personality.”

(He apparently also enjoys scrolling Instagram. “Horses,” she said with a sigh. “Nothing but horses.”)
“Tribunal Justice” pairs Levy, a former district attorney for Putnam County in New York, with the monarchal Justice Patricia DiMango, who stepped down from the state Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 2014, and Tanya Acker, a Yale-educated civil litigator. DiMango and Acker previously starred on “Hot Bench,” a show created by Sheindlin that continues in syndication.

Full text: On the big day, my wife gamely brought home a No. 1 Dad mug, which I sometimes drink coffee out of, and a No. 1 Dad T-shirt, which I sometimes sleep in, and a No. 1 Dad grilling spatula, which can be used to brand hamburgers and tuna steaks. This all made for a well-received Instagram post. But to be honest, it didn't really make me feel like a dad, let alone the No. 1 dad. Instead, I felt like a guy whose response to a major life milestone was to hide inside a bit.
When I think about my stepfather, who raised me, I think about the way he wielded his grill tongs, padding around the deck in his tapioca-colored apron, as if it were the most natural act in the world. Or the way he turned down the volume on the national television broadcast of N.F.L. games in favor of the local radio announcers, who "weren't idiots." Or the way he sought out a maritime museum anywhere we went on family vacation. I'm now a father of two with three years of experience, but if I tried any of those things today, I would hear a little voice in my head, saying, "Look at the big dad man, dadding it up for his family!"
"Irony has seeped into the felt of any fedora that I have ever owned -- not out of any wish of mine, but out of necessity," the essayist George W.S. Trow wrote in 1980 of his father's beloved headwear. "A fedora hat worn by me without the necessary protective irony would eat through my head and kill me."
So many of the signifiers that spring to mind when we think about dads are like this: Dated or goofy or vestigial or naïve. Take the riding lawn mower, a relic from a time before climate change made us cringe at the smell of burning gas. Or the Playboy stash, an anachronism of print culture. Or the mechanical wristwatch, an antique you can't even use to order pizza.
After three years of diaper blowouts and day-care-spawned plagues (Ever heard of something called "pleurisy"? Neither had I), I've come to see the old dad ways a little more sympathetically, and with some measure of recognition. After all, our dads were responding to the same essential dad conflict we are: the tension between giving your life over to the needs of your family and keeping enough mental space for yourself to stay sane. In that context, the rider mower makes brilliant sense. It's alone time ("What? Honey? I can't hear you! This thing's loud, huh!") that accomplishes a putatively necessary domestic task.
Still, the touchstones of Boomer dad culture have outlived their descriptive usefulness for younger generations. What, we might ask, is dad culture in 2023? Does it even exist?
Over the past month, I've reached out to dozens of millennial fathers -- friends, colleagues, perfect strangers -- to help me conduct a bit of qualitative research into the customs of the newish American dad.
I asked them what are the clothes, appliances, skills, movies, TV shows, books, video games, opinions, conversations and habits of mind that define being a dad today?
The warmth and eagerness with which they responded, often at great length and featuring Talmudic levels of nuance, suggests it's a question many of us have been mulling, privately, for quite some time.
Behind that enthusiasm, I think, is a real desire for many fathers to better define the social role they've taken on. One that has been deeply, if nebulously, changed by our evolving understanding of masculinity and who is responsible for household labor. What is the right balance between provider and caregiver? What is the amount of dumb bro stuff that can be retained? What positively distinguishes fatherhood from motherhood -- and why do even the more gender-enlightened, egalitarian among us still seem to want that identity to feel distinct?
Looking at the list as a whole, a few patterns emerge. The first is that technology and convenience have rendered optional many of the stereotypically analog dad skills of yore: Navigating, oil changing -- things of that nature. Our shows of skill are more likely to occur deep within a set of nested digital menus.
Or instead, we might demonstrate our authority through displays of taste. The millennial dad, who has spent his young adulthood becoming a sophisticated consumer, has had to negotiate a place for all this miscellaneous expertise in his family life. (Doing so can be complicated. There is no entry for coffee in the canon; those surveyed were split between dads who favored ever more complicated coffee setups and those who have made a brave -- and highly symbolic -- break with their Hario V60 in favor of a cavernous Mr. Coffee.)
Finally, the new dad culture has definitely not found it necessary to put away childish things. Fantasy football, old video games, Star Wars -- dads are finding ways to preserve the pleasures of boyhood.
There's an argument to be made that the millennial father is trapped in an eternal adolescence. But that doesn't feel right, at least to me, and certainly not to my knees, which feel every day of 38 years old. I happen to think the new dad culture reflects something positive, and even sweet: that the American father is expected, rightly, to share more of himself -- his time, his feelings, and even his most childish hobbies -- with his family.
That's why we have strong opinions about children's television and baby hiking carriers: We're trying our best at this thing. This thing, which lasts a lifetime and doesn't even come with an instruction manual. Can you believe it?

Full text: For Rocky Bucano, who fell for the music after buying a Salt-N-Pepa CD in 1986, his work in the Bronx "doesn't feel like work."
The Universal Hip Hop Museum, which will be part of Bronx Point, a new mixed-use development with affordable housing in the South Bronx, is not scheduled to open until 2025. But that hasn't stopped Rocky Bucano, the museum's executive director, from celebrating hip-hop's 50th anniversary this year.
"[R]Evolution of Hip Hop," an exhibition tracing the genre's momentum from 1986 to 1990, will offer free admission this August in honor of the anniversary. The show is running through September at the nonprofit's temporary headquarters in the Bronx Terminal Market.
Mr. Bucano, 63, lives in the Clason Point section of the Bronx with his wife, Kim, 62, who recently retired as a public-school teacher, and the younger of their two sons, Kylerr, 31. Rounding out the household are Tangy, the family's Bichon Frisé mix, and Toby, a former stray cat.
6 IN THE MORNIN' I get up around 6 or 7 a.m. and open up my Microsoft Surface Duo 2. I scroll through emails and read the Sunday edition of The Times. I do this in bed very quietly. I'm trying not to wake my wife up.
THE MESSAGE Around 8 or 10 o'clock, we normally order pancakes and scrambled eggs and maybe some corned beef hash from the Crosstown Diner. We have our breakfast watching the Sunday news. I like the political talk shows, like "This Week with George Stephanopoulos." My wife watches Channel 12, which has news on the Bronx, religiously. After that, we try to get our spiritual vibe on by watching Joel Osteen.
IN DA CLUB The exhibit at the Bronx Terminal Market opens at 1 p.m. My son Kylerr and I usually jump in the car and shoot over there. He oversees social media for the museum and is a docent. Most of the time, I'm there all afternoon. I'm meeting with people -- our visitors, our guests. Sometimes I'm working with the people who work at the museum, making sure everything is tight in terms of telling the stories of the different artifacts people are looking at. Sometimes I'll jump on the turntables if I feel like playing music.
SUPA DUPA FLY On Sundays we have a visiting D.J., Cutman LG. He's part of our team and he's always playing great music: James Brown and a lot of classic hip-hop like Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa. When people come in, not only do they see objects about the great golden era of hip-hop, they actually feel it and experience what the music was like.
PEOPLE EVERYDAY Being here on a Sunday is work, but it doesn't feel like work. I've been a part of this project from the beginning, since we first started looking for locations in 2014. It's part of my DNA now. It's who I am. And I enjoy meeting people from different parts of the country and different parts of the world and learning what their connection to hip-hop is. Each person has a unique story about how they fell in love with it. Sometimes it's the first record they bought, sometimes it's a Run-DMC concert they went to in 1986. I remember when I bought my first Salt-N-Pepa CD. That's what got me involved in loving the music.
ROCK BOX People from Europe come over here because they're true fans of classic hip-hop and they want to relive the earliest years. On weekdays, we have teachers bringing their students. Kids come in, and many have never seen a cassette player or a vinyl. They don't know what a boom box is. We have a huge boom box, and when they see it they're like, "What is that? Why do they call it a boom box?" So it's just a lot of feel-good moments for me. I see people smiling and doing their selfies.
IT'S TRICKY When I began this journey, I wasn't really astute in what's called "the museum experience." I've been learning on the job. The first exhibit was bare-bones. The second one we fine-tuned, made it a better experience in terms of how it was curated. And now, with this third exhibit, I think we've knocked it out of the park. It's the most immersive, the most entertaining, the most informative. I would say the number one thing people like right now is the Dapper Dan Lounge, where we have a couple of his original jackets, or the D.J. booth.
PUSH IT! When I get home, I might go to the gym in our community's clubhouse and lift some weights, or sometimes I'll walk down to the water. One of the ferry stops is not too far from where we live, so I'll go down there and stand by the water and enjoy the sights. It's a way of putting everything in perspective for me.
RAPPER'S DELIGHT For dinner on Sundays we like to order turkey wings from a soul food restaurant. We'll also get collard greens, and for my son, mac and cheese. I can't eat that stuff, but I love sweet potatoes. After dinner I'm normally on my computer, emailing, sending notes to my team, looking out for anything on social media I should be paying attention to. People say I work too much.
IT WAS A GOOD DAY I might watch some film on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but I go to bed early. My wife comes to bed late because she's retired. But at 10 o'clock I say, "I'll see you later, I'm going to sleep." And that's it.

Search for New Coach for Men's National Team Settles on Old One: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Berhalter was removed from the post after the World Cup, but the results of an investigation cleared the way for his return.
The United States men's soccer team announced Friday that it was rehiring Gregg Berhalter as its head coach for the run-up to the 2026 World Cup, concluding a monthslong, worldwide coaching search with the same man who had led the team from 2019 to 2022.
The move capped several whirlwind months for Berhalter, 49, who guided the American men to the round of 16 at the World Cup in Qatar but did not have his contract renewed in the aftermath of the tournament.
Instead, the U.S. Soccer Federation announced that it had started an independent investigation into his conduct after accusations made by the parents of one of his players that Berhalter had physically abused his wife, Rosalind, in an incident three decades ago, when they were dating as college students. The Berhalters, who remain married, reconciled shortly after the incident and have talked openly about it after the accusations this year.
The investigation, which concluded in March, cleared Gregg Berhalter of any wrongdoing -- meaning he did not improperly withhold information from the organization -- and opened a path for him to be rehired. It was unclear at that time, though, if that would happen.
"It was a great feeling, if you can imagine what the last six months have been like," Berhalter said at a Friday news conference about returning to the team. "I was really motivated to come back and really make a go of it this next World Cup and make the nation proud."
Matt Crocker, who was hired as the team's sporting director in April, led the coaching search, describing it as a grueling, data-driven process. Crocker declined to reveal any of the final candidates, who were put through a 10-hour day of tests and interviews, but noted that they had included current and former coaches from top clubs and national teams around the world.
Crocker also pushed back against the notion that the past six months -- during which the team has been led by a pair of interim coaches -- had been a waste of time, given that the program had essentially ended up where it started.
"It might look like as if there's been a lost period of time," Crocker said. "But sometimes you need time to reflect and to move forward."
In that vein, Crocker said Berhalter would not formally rejoin the team until after the Gold Cup, which begins at the end of this month, because he thought there was still a period of big picture strategizing that needed to take place.
The team is also scheduled to play in the final of the Concacaf Nations League on Sunday.
"What we didn't want to create was the environment of, Gregg puts his boots straight back on and slides back into the environment and it's very much business as usual," Crocker said.
The investigation of Berhalter this year was prompted by information from the parents of the United States forward Gio Reyna. Reyna's mother, Danielle, had been a teammate of Rosalind Berhalter's at North Carolina, and his father, Claudio, had played with Berhalter on the national team.
Although the families had been close friends for years, the Reynas became upset with Berhalter during the World Cup because of Gio Reyna's limited role. After the tournament, Berhalter made public comments about an unnamed player at the World Cup who "was clearly not meeting expectations on and off the field" and whom the staff had considered sending home. Gio Reyna later revealed in an Instagram apology that he was the player in question.
After those comments became public, the Reynas went to U.S. Soccer officials with details of the decades-old incident.
Berhalter said he had not spoken with Reyna since the World Cup but identified the mending of that relationship as one of his first priorities.
"I'd certainly acknowledge that there's work to do," Berhalter said, "and Gio is an important player to this team. He's an extremely talented individual, and I have the obligation and the commitment to coach him like I coach every other player."
In recent days, key players on the men's team, including the star forward Christian Pulisic, had suggested that they supported Berhalter's return.
"I think he's done a great job," Pulisic told reporters of Berhalter after a 3-0 victory over Mexico on Thursday night. "I'm glad we can just pick up where we left off," he added.
Berhalter, who has a 37-11-12 record as head coach of the team, said the past six months of his life, while turbulent, had been productive. He traveled to England to observe and speak with coaches in the Premier League. (He also met with a number of American players, though he described those interactions as primarily social.)
Berhalter, while upbeat about the team's performance at the last World Cup, also had time to reflect on its shortcomings at the tournament, in which it lost to the Netherlands in the round of 16. He mentioned its execution on set plays and in its transition offense as areas that could be improved.
"We're going to have to learn how to beat big opponents in knockout games," Berhalter said. "That's the next step for this group."
Berhalter was not quite sitting around and waiting to be asked back to the team. He acknowledged on Friday that he had been speaking with Club América, one of the powerhouses of the Mexican league, about its coaching vacancy.
But he had also told the Mexican club that he would need to see out the interview process with the United States, that he would regret it for the rest of his life if he passed up the opportunity to return to his old job.
"Thankfully, they were accommodating," he said of Club América, "and I got the job, obviously. And now I'm here."

Beach Wheelchairs Make Summer Fun Accessible: [Travel Desk]

Full text: Wheelchairs with balloon-like tires are available at a growing number of U.S. beaches, giving disabled people and their families more options for fun in the sun.
For Linda Green James, getting onto the beach is usually top of mind when she's planning a summer getaway with her daughter Suzi Osborne, 47, who uses a wheelchair because of a traumatic brain injury.
But when the two stay at a friend's condo in Pompano Beach, Fla., they usually resign themselves to hanging out around the pool.
During their visit in January, Ms. James was thrilled to spy a beach wheelchair, a device with chunky, oversize tires that can roll over sand and uneven terrain, that they could borrow from a beach equipment shack. "We had been going to this condo for years, but Suzi had never been able to go to the beach, just to the pool," said Ms. James, 75, a retired college professor from Brownsville, Tenn.
"It's not much fun to go to the beach when one of your family members can't join you," she said. "With the chair, family time is just that."
A 'huge business opportunity'
Beach wheelchairs are becoming more common at America's shorelines, thanks to laws, government initiatives and growing demand by disabled travelers.
The wheelchairs available at many public beaches either for rent or at no charge have PVC or steel frames and balloon-like tires. A three-wheeled version with a reclined frame lets disabled beachgoers float in the surf.
Most of the chairs need someone to push, but some models are motorized, offering more independence. Typically, visitors may borrow the chairs on a first-come, first-served basis, at beaches or rental shops. Some beaches also accept reservations.
For millions of people like Ms. James and Ms. Osborne, accessibility is central to vacation planning. About 2 percent of the U.S. population uses a manual wheelchair or a motorized mobility aid, according to the 2019 American Housing Survey by the U.S. Census. Disabled travelers account for $ 58.2 billion of the $ 1.2 trillion U.S. travel market -- nearly 5 percent -- and they travel about the same amount as people who don't have disabilities, MMGY Global, a tourism marketing company, said in a 2022 report.
"Not only is inclusivity the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint, it's also a huge business opportunity," said Chris Davidson, an executive vice president of MMGY Travel Intelligence, the company's travel-market research division.
The Americans With Disabilities Act requires all state and local governments "to give people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from all of their programs, services and activities." The A.D.A. doesn't cover the provision of beach wheelchairs, but another law -- the Architectural Barriers Act -- applies to national parks with beaches, which must have an access route like a boardwalk or a mat.
"The A.D.A. applies to all public beaches," said Jennifer Perry, an access specialist with the Northeast ADA Center, a government-funded organization that provides guidance on A.D.A. compliance. "They have a requirement to provide program access, but there is no clear road map to what that is."
Rian Wilkinson, president of Marine Rescue Products, in Middletown, R.I., sells mats and wheelchairs to beaches around the country. "Most cities are making it a point to say, 'We're A.D.A.-compatible,"' he said. "Even the local beach here has six wheelchairs."
Freedom, and a spot for a fishing pole
Founded in 1996 by Mike Deming and his wife, Karen Deming, after a car accident left her quadriplegic, DeBug Mobility Products makes stainless-steel beach wheelchairs, including a three-wheeled floating model for $ 2,275 and a standard model with a fixed leg rest for $ 2,475. The standard model can be modified with options to tilt the seat, recline the back and elevate the legs, as well as to add holders for a fishing pole, a drink and an umbrella.
"It gives wheelchair users a sense of normality and freedom," said Ms. Deming, 61. "There's nothing worse than getting to the end of the ramp and not being able to go any farther when all your friends and family are sitting around on the beach."
Some motorized beach wheelchair manufacturers rent their chairs directly to guests at hotels. Sand Helper, one such company, offers battery-operated, four-wheel-drive wheelchairs to people for about $ 500 a week in Florida and several other states, and $ 30 an hour in Ocean City, Md. The company sells its chairs for around $ 12,000 -- a particularly hefty sum considering that beach wheelchairs aren't covered by Medicaid or Medicare.
There also is at least one manual model that can be propelled by the user: the Hippocampe All-Terrain Beach Wheelchair, which retails for around $ 4,000 and is manufactured by Vipamat, based in France. Among the more economical options, Wheeleez offers kits to convert a street wheelchair into a beach wheelchair. Options range from around $ 300 to $ 1,000, depending on the size and number of wheels.
Opening up the 'magic' of beaches
Finding beach-accessibility information can be a challenge. The California Coastal Commission lists at least 114 locations in the state with beach wheelchairs, several of which -- including Imperial Beach in San Diego County and Laguna Beach in Orange County -- offer motorized chairs at no cost. But piecemeal listings by other local governments and beaches require people to check destinations one by one.
Some accessible-travel writers are working to fill the information gap. Sylvia Longmire, 48, of Sanford, Fla., who has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, has compiled listings of dozens of Florida beaches that provide beach wheelchairs and mats on her accessible-travel blog, Spin the Globe. "I went eight years without going to the beach, and thought it was unattainable for me forever," Ms. Longmire wrote on the blog. "This was until I discovered two revolutionary inventions -- the beach mat and beach wheelchair -- that reopened the magic of my native Florida beaches to me again."
Jennifer Allen, 39, an Elizabethtown, Pa., mother whose son Jaden, 7, was diagnosed with spina bifida in 2017 and uses a wheelchair, lists more than 50 beaches that provide wheelchairs from New York to Florida on her website, Wonders Within Reach. "When we received our son's diagnosis, we had to find new ways to travel and get outdoors," Ms. Allen said. "We weren't able to find a lot of resources to help us do that, especially with children. I decided to share as we travel and learn, so that other parents can be inspired and enabled to get out and explore with their kids with disabilities."
On a trip to Buckroe Beach in Hampton, Va., Ms. Allen was pleased to find a paved boardwalk and a surf wheelchair. "They had all the things we needed, but we didn't know beforehand because they didn't have it available online," she said.
Despite all the new measures and the growing number of beaches with wheelchairs -- from Texas to New York to the U.S. Virgin Islands -- some places remain an "accessibility nightmare," Ms. Allen said, citing North Carolina. This summer, her family is planning a trip to the Outer Banks in that state, where she said, "There is less parking, fewer accessible access points and fewer beach wheelchairs available on loan."
The family will rent a beach wheelchair to be delivered to an oceanfront rental home, but, she said, there will be still a major obstacle: "It sounds like we'll still have some work to do to get the chair up over the dunes."

Full text: In his latest film, Wes Anderson and his all-stars go meta with a TV show about a theatrical play that, in turn, is about a small town, U.S.A.
"Asteroid City," the latest from Wes Anderson, is filled with the assiduous visuals, mythic faces and charming curiosities that you expect from this singular filmmaker. It's comic and often wry, but like some of his other films, it has the soul of a tragedy. It's partly set in 1955 in a fictional Southwest town, a lonely four corners with a diner, gas station and motor inn. Palm trees and cactuses stipple the town, and reddish buttes rise in the distance. It looks like an ordinary pit stop save for the atomic cloud soon mushrooming in the sky.
Written by Anderson, the film is about desire and death, small mysteries and cosmic unknowns and the stories that we make of all the stuff called life. It opens in black-and-white on an unnamed television host (Bryan Cranston, severe and mustachioed) in a studio. Tightly encased by the boxy aspect ratio and speaking into the camera, he introduces the evening's program, a "backstage" look at the creation of a new play, "Asteroid City," that's been made "expressly for this broadcast." He then presents the playwright (Edward Norton), who rises from his typewriter to stand on a bare stage and present the characters.
The suited television host and the broadcast studio with its ticking clock conjure up 1950s live anthology dramas like "Studio One," and you may flash on Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" when the host and playwright start speaking. Anderson quickly fills up the stage and the film, too. A train chugs in under the opening credits carrying a bounty of goods: gravel, avocados, pecans, John Deere tractors, plump Pontiacs and a 10-megaton nuclear warhead. Jeffrey Wright enters to play a five-star general, while Tilda Swinton shows up as a scientist. Tom Hanks plays a dashing curmudgeon; Adrien Brody makes the muscular theater director.
The drama starts soon after the playwright's introductory remarks, except it doesn't look anything like a theater production. It looks like a film, a meticulous, detailed, visually balanced wide-screen Wes Anderson one. There's no proscenium, no stage, no wings, no audience. The blue sky stretches over the town; the yellow desert extends into infinity. The characters enter by car and bus, and are shot in long view and intimate close-up, beautifully framed by the camera. The palette is an astonishment, a dusty rainbow of hues. It looks like this story was left to bleach in the sun before being wrapped in transparent yellowed plastic.
The colors are mesmerizing and ever-so-gently destabilizing. These pigments signal that you've entered a new fictional realm that, like the television studio, is at once immediately recognizable and somehow foreign. The interplay between the familiar and the strange, like that between the theatrical and the cinematic, is a foundational theme in Anderson's films, which, like most movies, look a lot like life yet are always different. What makes that difference is art -- the voice, sensibility, technique, craft, money, luck and how the thrilling, terrifying mess of existence is gathered, organized and then set loose upon the world.
Divided into acts, the play's first section commences with the arrival of the newly widowed Augie Steenbeck, a war photographer played by a method-y actor, Jones Hall. (Jason Schwartzman plays both.) Augie, his brainy teenage son, Woodrow (Jake Ryan), and three interchangeable young daughters are visiting for Asteroid Day, an event that commemorates the day (Sept. 23, 3007 B.C.!) a meteor crashed nearby, leaving a crater now overlooked by an observatory. More visitors appear, including a teacher with a flock of children, some singing cowboys and other parents with teens who, like Woodrow, are contestants in an Asteroid Day competition.
Together with Scarlett Johansson, Schwartzman fills out the film's expressive center with humor and perfect timing. Johansson also has dual roles as both an actor and a character. She's Midge Campbell in the play, a sultry Hollywood star who rolls into town with her own whiz-kid and a bodyguard. Midge and Augie meet cute at the diner, but their relationship blooms while they're in their respective rental cabins. There, framed by windows, they face each other and open up, talking in that somewhat deadpan, patently Anderson-screwball way that puts up a snappy, performative front which slowly gives way to deep feeling.
Anderson regularly switches back and forth between the television story and the drama in the town, gradually putting them into meaningful, dynamic and poignant play with each other. There are crises in both, along with self-doubt, confrontations, assignations and discussions about art and life. He's crammed a great deal into this film, including cinematic allusions and theatrical lore. The play takes place in September 1955, the month that James Dean died in another parched Southwest wasteland; there's an audition with Jones and the playwright that evokes Brando's famous one for Tennessee Williams's "A Streetcar Named Desire."

If you know "Streetcar," you may remember Blanche's famous cry: "I don't want realism. I want magic!" It's a heartbreaking and naked appeal, one that could be uttered (though with far more restraint) by Anderson. There's so much yearning in "Asteroid City." Over the years, he has refined his filmmaking, honing the way that he tells stories, how he organizes cinematic time and space. His visual style is so distinct and instantly recognizable that it's spawned imitators and inspired an Instagram account (and now book) called Accidentally Wes Anderson, a compendium of Anderson-esque visuals that exist in real life.
An accidentally Wes Anderson world is an amusing idea, partly because his films can outwardly seem somehow removed from life despite their agonies, broken hearts, dashed dreams and nuclear weapons. Part of what makes his work memorable and often unexpectedly touching is that his filmmaking -- the stylized way he orders the world with his richly populated cast of collaborators -- expresses how he navigates the world's confusions. When Augie shows Midge a bald patch on his head where he was wounded by shrapnel while on assignment, he is sharing a reminder of the horrors that he's seen. It's an emblem of his pain, but it's also an invitation to another person and to us -- an appeal to our sympathies.

Bud Light Loses Perch As Top Seller After Boycott: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bud Light lost its share of retail beer sales in recent weeks following a boycott by consumers over a promotional post by a transgender influencer.
Bud Light has been dethroned as the nation's top-selling beer in recent weeks, a data analytics company said, a sign that the backlash the brewer received from conservatives over its relationship with a transgender influencer may be taking a toll.
Taking its place in the No. 1 spot is Modelo Especial, a Mexican beer made by Constellation Brands, making up 8.4 percent of U.S. retail beer sales in the four weeks that ended June 3, according to Nielsen IQ data analyzed by the consulting firm Bump Williams. Sales of Bud Light fell to 7.3 percent in the same period.
The shift follows a conservative-led boycott against Bud Light that started after Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer, posted a video on Instagram on April 1 promoting a Bud Light contest. Bud Light's share of retail sales has dropped about three percentage points since the boycott began.
Sales began to dip after commentators and celebrities on the right began to protest. Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Bud Light, later announced the departure of two marketing executives, but the company's attempt to backtrack drew further criticism, this time from liberals and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
The controversy has spotlighted the challenges brands and retailers like Adidas and Target have faced in marketing to L.G.B.T.Q. consumers in a polarized political environment.
Anheuser-Busch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
"Bud Light's missteps felt like a betrayal to both its liberal and conservative customers, and that trust is going to take months, if not years, to rebuild," said Daniel Korschun, an associate professor of marketing at Drexel University's LeBow College of Business.
Sales of Bud Light hovered around 10 percent of U.S. retail beer sales until the four weeks that ended on April 22, when it dropped to 8.7 percent, and have trended downward since. Modelo, Coors Light and Miller Lite each saw bumps in their share of the retail beer market in the same period.
Research has shown that the effects of boycotts are often short-lived. Bud Light has dominated the market for at least the past two decades, but in recent years it has faced tough competition, said Dave Williams, the vice president of analytics and insights at Bump Williams.
"I can't recall any other brand surpassing Bud Light in recent years, though brands such as Modelo Especial and Michelob Ultra have certainly been on an upward trajectory doing their best to narrow the gap between themselves and Bud Light," Mr. Williams said in an email.
Bud Light still has a stronghold over the American beer market. Based on year-to-date data, it is still the top-selling beer in the United States. It also sells more beer by volume than any other brand.
The data analyzed was only for off-premise sales, meaning it does not consider beer purchases from bars and restaurants.

Trump Supporters Avoid Conflict in Miami Despite Calls for Retribution: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Calls for retribution were plentiful after the former president's indictments, but the demonstrations proved tame, a possible result of the aggressive prosecution of the Jan. 6 rioters.
Twice in recent months, allies of former President Donald J. Trump have used violent language to criticize the criminal charges brought against him, calling for vengeance and encouraging Mr. Trump's supporters to respond to the indictments as though they were acts of war.
Both times -- first in April in Manhattan and then on Tuesday in Miami -- police and civic leaders raised concerns that the angry rhetoric could lead to violent protests when Mr. Trump appeared in court. Both times, in both cities, the crowds that actually showed up for Mr. Trump were relatively tame and fairly small.
But just because the aggressive words did not result in aggressive actions hardly meant they were not corrosive to the fabric or the practice of democracy, scholars of political violence said.
They did, however, note that after the cataclysmic events of Jan. 6, 2021, many Trump supporters have become more reluctant to act on statements by Mr. Trump's allies suggesting that a second American Revolution might be coming or calling for civil war.
Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow in the Democracy, Conflict and Governance Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, pointed to several reasons for that -- even in the face of language of the sort used last week by Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona. In a Twitter post on Friday, referring to Mr. Trump's indictment on charges of obstruction and mishandling classified documents, Mr. Biggs wrote bluntly, "Eye for an eye."
One reason for the absence of conflict in Miami, Ms. Kleinfeld wrote in an email, was that the prosecutions of Jan. 6 protesters -- which now amount to more than 1,000 criminal cases -- have had "a real deterrent effect" on those who might have once considered violence. She also said that many people remain "angry at Trump for failing to provide monetary support for those jailed on his behalf after Jan. 6."
Other people, Ms. Kleinfeld went on, seemed to have stayed away from pro-Trump protests, including those this week, fearing that they might become entrapped in what they believe to be "false flag operations" by the F.B.I.
There was certainly no shortage of belligerent language in the days leading up to Mr. Trump's arraignment in Miami.
On Instagram, his eldest son's fiancée, Kimberly Guilfoyle, posted a photo of the former president with the words, "Retribution is coming," all in capital letters.
In Georgia, at the Republican state convention, Kari Lake, who refused to concede the Arizona election for governor in 2022 and who is an ardent defender of Mr. Trump, emphasized that many of Mr. Trump's supporters owned guns.
Roger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump's longtime political adviser, called for protests -- though he cautioned that they should be peaceful. A Miami chapter of the Proud Boys long associated with Mr. Stone echoed the invitation, posting a flier on its Telegram page last week advertising an event at the federal courthouse on Tuesday morning.
But in the end, like many others, the Proud Boys did not show up, suggesting that Mr. Trump's grip on the organization may have loosened.
After the violence at the Capitol, some high-ranking Proud Boys disavowed Mr. Trump altogether, expressing bitterness at him for having left them standing on a limb. After all, scores of Proud Boys were ultimately charged or questioned in the Justice Department's vast investigation of the Capitol attack. And just last month, four of the group's top leaders -- including its former chairman, Enrique Tarrio -- were convicted of seditious conspiracy.
While it is possible the Proud Boys, who love to troll the media, never intended to take part in a protest in Miami, it is also possible the group has simply had enough of supporting Mr. Trump and suffering the consequences.
Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in political violence, offered another reason that the Miami protests seemed to fizzle: Mr. Trump's own actions before his arraignment were far less incendiary than those he took before Jan. 6.
While Mr. Trump posted the date and location of his court appearance on Tuesday on social media, he did not explicitly summon his supporters to a "wild" protest in Washington as he did before Jan. 6. Nor did he appear before his arraignment in Miami and urge his followers to "fight like hell" or undertake anything resembling the march on the Capitol he called for just before the building was attacked.
Moreover, the efforts to organize the protest in Miami essentially took place over the course of a weekend -- between Mr. Trump's indictment on Thursday and his initial court appearance five days later.
In the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, by contrast, teams of professional organizers staged two pro-Trump rallies in Washington that brought tens of thousands of people into the streets over the span of two months, creating momentum for what followed. Among those who attended the events -- one in November 2020 and the second in December -- were large contingents from the Proud Boys and another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia.
"What happened before Jan. 6 as opposed to what happened last week," Mr. Pape said, "was so much more worrisome."
Indeed, Ms. Kleinfeld said that elected officials or figures in the media who use violent language should be called out for their statements, but that a sense of balance was needed so critics were not crying wolf about events that did not present a genuine peril.
"Americans won't believe real threats," she said, "if false ones are treated as serious."

After Years of Hype, a Matchup Where 'the Best Are Fighting the Best': [Sports Desk]

Full text: Crawford and Spence have talked about fighting for years. Now that they've agreed on a bout, they're hoping it draws an audience beyond the usual fans of the sport.
As the boxers Errol Spence Jr. and Terence Crawford exchanged verbal barbs on Wednesday at the Palladium Times Square ahead of their much-delayed and anticipated bout later this summer, technicians streamed the promotional event on a billboard outside. The fighters arrived in Manhattan less than 24 hours after they participated in a similar news conference near Los Angeles at the Beverly Hills Hotel, playing up boxing's ties to the entertainment world.
Showtime Sports executives and others involved in the buildup to the fight have seen the two largest media markets in the U.S. as necessary stops in their efforts to promote a bout that is seen as both marquee for the sport and a draw for casual fans who might not normally care about -- or pay for -- a boxing event.
After nearly a half-decade of hype and false starts, Spence (28-0, 22 knockouts) and Crawford (39-0, 30 knockouts) will face each other in a unification 147-pound bout in Las Vegas on July 29.
Crawford holds the belt in the World Boxing Organization, while Spence is the champion among the three other major sanctioning bodies, meaning the winner will become the first undisputed champion of the weight class since 1988.
The fight offers a rare bout with two of the best boxers in the world fighting each other in their prime, and it has been compared to memorable matchups such as Floyd Mayweather Jr. against Manny Pacquiao in 2015 and Sugar Ray Leonard against Thomas Hearns in 1981.
"We got to show these people in suits, we got to show these other fighters that there is a reward in taking risks," Spence, 33, told reporters on Wednesday. He added: "If you fight the best, there's a reward for that."
Demand for the match has built as each man has risen through his career. The two sides nearly finalized a bout for last fall, but negotiations fell apart. Crawford, 35, instead agreed to a December fight against a lesser opponent, David Avanesyan, on the little-known streaming service BLK Prime.
"The negotiations with Spence and his team didn't go according to plan, so I just took that fight in the meantime," Crawford said in a brief interview, while scrolling through Instagram on his phone.
The fight went unscheduled until 2021 in large part because Crawford's former promoter, Top Rank, rarely did business with Spence's promoter, Premier Boxing Champions, because of conflicts about fight distribution. Stephen Espinoza, the president of Showtime Sports, said in an interview that negotiations became easier after Crawford became a free agent in 2021, but he said it was "a bit of a surprise" that Crawford backed out in the fall. After Crawford defeated Avanesyan via technical knockout, Espinoza said the negotiations picked up quickly with an added sense of urgency.
"There was a huge sense of disappointment with everything in the fall, and that as much as anything was a big motivator," Espinoza said. "No one liked that feeling, so when we all came back to the table, everybody gave a little bit more and that was able to get it done."
That process included Spence and Crawford talking to each other occasionally on video calls. Spence, in an interview, said he felt the gesture expedited the agreement as each man got to know the other personally. On the calls, Spence said he and Crawford also discussed compromises they could each make to finalize the bout, including pay splits and the control of revenue beyond pay-per-view buyers.
Spence and Crawford are far from the first boxers to participate in political gamesmanship when it comes to future fights, especially highly anticipated ones. The Mayweather-Pacquiao fight notoriously happened years later than fans had hoped. Red tape among promoters, financial disagreements and the fear of adding a loss to a fighter's record are three of the biggest culprits for why elite matchups often take so long to materialize.
But the boxing calendar this year has quickly filled up with enticing shows, including Gervonta Davis's seventh-round technical knockout against Ryan Garcia in April and Devin Haney's decision win over Vasiliy Lomachenko in May. Espinoza said he hoped those kinds of matchups would become more common as boxers came to see the fights as cultural events.
"You don't get undisputed titles unless the best are fighting the best," Espinoza said.
The winner on July 29 will be regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the sport, and though it took a while to finalize, Spence said he expected that fans would be pleased.
"Everyone has matched us up together for years," Spence said. "The time is right. All roads led to him for me, and for him, all roads led to me."

E.U. Adds Google Charges, Targeting Its Ad Dominance: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: European Union regulators filed new antitrust charges against Google, which could lead to fines and orders for the company to change its business practices.
Google was charged on Wednesday with violating European Union antitrust laws by using its dominance in online advertising to undercut rivals, the latest in a string of cases around the world that strike at the core of the internet giant's business model.
The case was brought by the European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-nation European Union, and is the fourth time Google has been charged with violating European antitrust laws in recent years. In this instance, the European Union accused Google of abusing its control of the market for buying and selling online advertising.
The U.S. Justice Department brought similar charges against Google in January, accusing the company of illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology that powers online advertising. Britain's antitrust authority has also been investigating Google's advertising practices.
The outcomes of the cases could have significant implications for Google's parent company, Alphabet, which reaped most of its $ 60 billion in profit last year from advertising. Advertising underpins nearly all of Google's most popular services, including search, email, maps and Android, and allows the company to offer them for free.
"Google is present at almost all levels of the so-called adtech supply chain," Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice president of the European Commission, said in a statement. "Our preliminary concern is that Google may have used its market position to favor its own intermediation services."
"Not only did this possibly harm Google's competitors but also publishers' interests, while also increasing advertisers' costs," added Ms. Vestager, who oversees digital and competition policy.
The new charges against Google are part of a long-running effort by the European authorities to clamp down on the world's largest technology companies. Apple and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, are also the subjects of antitrust investigations. Last year, the European Union passed new antitrust and digital services laws to tighten oversight of the biggest tech companies. And on Wednesday, the European Parliament, a legislative branch of the European Union, passed a draft law regulating artificial intelligence.
In recent years, the European authorities have fined Google billions of dollars over what they say are antitrust violations related to its Android mobile operating system, shopping service and another piece of its advertising business. All the cases remain tied up in court after legal appeals by Google.
With the new charges, the European Commission unveiled what is known as a "statement of objections" against Google, outlining why it believes the company has violated antitrust laws. It is one step in what could be a long process before final decisions are made about whether to impose a fine of up to 10 percent of Google's global revenue or to order other changes to its business practices. A settlement could also be reached.
Google said it disagreed with the regulators' finding and would "respond accordingly."
"Our advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers," said Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads. "Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The commission's investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new."
European regulators began investigating Google two years ago, focusing on the display advertising market, which includes the banners and other visual formats on websites. Google offers a number of services to advertisers and publishers in this sector. It collects data to target advertising, sells ad space on websites and offers products that serve as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers that own websites.
In controlling so much of the online advertising supply chain, Ms. Vestager has said, Google makes it harder for rivals to compete. Publishers such as News Corp have long complained that Google's dominance limits how much money they can generate from advertising put on their websites, or for rival services to emerge.
The European Publishers Council, an industry group representing media companies, applauded Wednesday's action. The group said it had filed a complaint over a year ago describing how Google "leveraged their position to the disadvantage of publishers."
"We look forward to working with the commission as the case continues," said the council's executive director, Angela Mills Wade.

Full text: Judson Jones, a member of The Times's Weather Data team, tracks how global weather patterns affect even the most remote regions. He's been busy.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Last week, New Yorkers woke up to a hazy orange skyline. Smoke from wildfires raging in Canada had poured over the border, blotting out skyscrapers and making the air dangerous to breathe. At one point on Wednesday, the air quality in New York was recorded as the worst in the world.
Then on Thursday, scientists announced that it would be an El Niño summer, a global weather pattern that can drastically raise temperatures.
Keeping an eye on it all was Judson Jones, a meteorologist and reporter on The New York Times's Weather Data team. Since joining the newspaper in October, Mr. Jones has kept tabs on a range of weather phenomena, such as "atmospheric rivers" in California and Arctic blasts in the Northeast. He relies on models and data to keep readers informed as climates become more extreme.
In an interview, Mr. Jones discussed reporting on the smoke as it swept through parts of the United States and the evolution of The Times's weather coverage. This interview has been edited and condensed.
Did you have a sense that the smoke in New York was going to be as bad as it was?
On Tuesday, we started looking at the forecast models. The high resolution model only goes out 18 hours, so you only start to get a glimpse. Then the National Weather Service forecasters were mentioning it. By Wednesday morning, as soon as the sun rose, there was this huge concentration of smoke. The models were showing it staying together as this big, dense mass, and moving.
It actually arrived about three hours earlier than I expected. The fact you could see this mass of smoke moving like a blob was freaky. The time-lapse Earth camera we very quickly put out was apocalyptic. It's like putting on a giant Instagram filter, or in this case it was like you photoshopped out all the buildings.
Are there any ideas you have for different ways to cover weather events as they become more consistent and impactful?
Our weather team likes to work with all the teams across the board at The Times. We don't like to keep things to ourselves. That's what makes us dynamic. Our team has already been working hand in hand with the folks that have built our wildfire tracker. Air quality and the smoke forecast are all products that came out of this group. We've been thinking through how we cover this better, how we inform our readers, how we give them something tangible and how we explain how that affects them.
As we move forward, we're going to encourage even more group collaboration. Every fire, every situation is different. Even when these fires burn in the middle of nowhere, the smoke impacts somebody.
The El Niño summer was just officially announced. It feels like everything is compounding.
El Niño is likely not going to have an immediate effect on everything. It doesn't always have a huge effect on the summer weather patterns. But as we get into winter, you really start to see that shift. Globally, we're very much going to see those effects as we move into that season.
El Niño really affects weather patterns worldwide. Expect Australia and parts of Indonesia to be more dry. You also see more dryness in South America. The wet weather patterns in places like southern Brazil and parts of Argentina and Chile -- you can see that shift a little bit more. There's more dryness toward South Africa and elsewhere. In India, it impacts the monsoon season.
Are we going to see this immediately? Probably not. But the more it takes hold and the stronger it gets, the more that we see these dramatic changes.
As a meteorologist and a journalist, what is your reaction to these events -- extreme heat, wildfires, El Niño -- happening at once?
I don't want to overhype it. I think we're already seeing the extremes, partly because of climate change. These extremes happen in years of La Niña and El Niño.
We're trying to notify people about extremes before they happen. Recently we launched an extreme weather tracker. You can choose up to four locations in the United States right now, and you'll get an email saying if extreme weather is likely in your area. We're trying to inform people ahead of extreme weather as best we can. There are amazing meteorologists and scientists that produce a lot of great information, and we're trying to make that more readily available to the public.
Are you thinking about how weather coverage at The Times might evolve as climate change continues to as well?
What's amazing about The New York Times is that it has been devoted to covering the climate and climate change, and reporting on what can be attributed and what can't be attributed to climate change. A lot of other media organizations have had weather teams that then became climate teams. The Times has done it the other way around.
We're really excited. Our team is diving into this and is partnering with the Climate desk on articles and asking questions. Can we attribute this to climate change? What are scientists saying about that issue? We think it's important to be honest about saying when we know and when we don't know, or rather when scientists know and when they don't know.
I heard you got in trouble as a child for running to the window in school to try to see a tornado. Does weather still excite you that much?
There's something about the raw power of it -- it's not something you can control, but it's interesting to try to understand it. The sad part is when it hits something. The coolest thing to see is a tornado in the middle of a cornfield and doing absolutely nothing.
There's something pretty powerful about the natural beauty of these things. The Weather Data team has tracked wildfire smoke in New York City (left), floods in California (center) and cold weather in the Northeast (right).

Looking Through A Men's Catalog, Buying Nothing: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With the release of the documentary "All Man: The International Male Story," a writer reflects on his formative experience with the International Male catalog during adolescence.
Like Marti Muth -- my high school English teacher who slid a copy of "The Normal Heart" across my desk in 1986 and said "Read this" -- International Male knew I was gay before I did.
My closeted teen behind devoured the company's men's wear catalog when it landed in my family's mailbox in the 1980s. I was drawn to the fanciful clothing -- things like rope-yarn tops and peekaboo rower shorts -- that were a universe removed from my fat boy pants. Page through a copy of the catalog today and the clothes look queerly masculine, like something Lil Nas X would drape from his body.
According to the new documentary "All Man: The International Male Story," available on streaming services, I wasn't alone. Through interviews with celebrity fans, catalog models, company employees and Gene Burkard, the company's gay founder, the film explores how for some 40 years a catalog of outré men's wear became a generation-defining gay chef d'oeuvre.
In a recent interview, one of the film's directors, Bryan Darling, told me he hopes audiences find the documentary to be an "empowering" discovery, or rediscovery, of the catalog's peacocky fashion and pre-Instagram gay eroticism. It was for him: He'd never seen the catalog until Jesse Finley Reed, his co-director, showed him a copy.
"When I opened it, especially when I saw the stuff from the '80s, it was like, why don't we have as much fun now?" said Darling, who, like Reed, is gay.
The movie charts the catalog's rise and fall, starting with the first issue in 1976 -- a collection of European-inspired men's wear curated by Burkard, a Wisconsin native -- and ends when the last catalog was shipped around 2007. (Burkard died at 90 in 2020.) In the decades between, the catalog was a multimillion-dollar success, taking in around $ 100 million annually in the early 1990s.
Editorially, the catalog never billed itself as being for gays, but many buyers and art directors in the tight-knit company were gay men and straight women who knew how to appeal to gay taste. Some male models declined an International Male gig out of fear they'd look or be considered gay.
I never bought anything from International Male. But for many gay Gen Xers like me, the catalog was formative -- the gay coming-of-age equivalent of my straight middle school friends drooling over a stolen copy of Playboy. Browsing it helped me discern, even if I didn't fully understand, that I was into guys, a torturous realization in an era when the most I heard about gay men was that they were clowns and sickos.
I didn't see myself in the men in the catalog -- I was too young, round and fey -- but I saw myself making out with them, one day, on that sandy Arcadia where I assumed they all lived. I studied the catalog alone and afraid but aroused, lingering over shirtless men with aspirational treasure trails that Jesus warned me were off limits.
But magazines you could "read" in the bathroom or hide under the bed -- those were pretty much the only sexual-awakening materials boys like me had.
I recently reached out to friends to see if they had similar memories of the catalog and boy, did they. Benjamin remembered nervously buying it at a bookstore near his family's home near Columbus, Ohio.
"Imagine the mental gymnastics involved in being so deeply closeted but convincing myself that, sure, I'm a 16-year-old who's into fashion and wants to look good in a jockstrap -- for his girlfriend," he told me. "That's not gay at all."
Some friends actually did buy clothes. Carl said what looked good on the page made him appear in person like he was in "a very, very gay production of 'Peter Pan."' Patrick bought a wrestling singlet, of sorts, that served a singular purpose.
"If I wanted to speed up getting into bed with a guy," he told me, "I'd put it on and it got things moving."
What "All Man" doesn't explain is how the catalog found me. I'm guessing someone typed my address into a database after I won a picnic basket of Calvin Klein Obsession products in a GQ fashion show raffle at a Cleveland mall around 1986. Or maybe someone at the Columbia House record club saw that my order of 11 albums for a penny included the "Godspell" and "Fame" soundtracks, and said: This queen will buy a man panty.
Or maybe the gay gods looked down on me and said, like the head angel to Clarence in "It's a Wonderful Life": "A man down on Earth needs our help."

Simply Strolling Offers A Chance to Be Amazed: [Science Desk]

Full text: Incorporating awe into your daily stroll can bring mental and physical benefits. Here's how to get started.
Welcome to the first installment of Well's five-week newsletter series dedicated to walking tips and inspiration.
This week, we're exploring "awe walks," outdoor rambles designed to cultivate a sense of amazement. To help, I tapped Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of "Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life."
Awe, Dr. Keltner explained, is that complex emotion we experience when encountering something so vast that our sense of self recedes. It can be positive or negative (like the feelings that come from witnessing violence or death), but the awe that feels good is the type found in moments of wonder and humility.
Many people associate awe with places like the Grand Canyon, Dr. Keltner said. But some feel it more frequently in response to commonplace things like a nighttime sky blazing with stars, he said. In short: Awe is more accessible than you might think.
And research suggests it's good for your health, too. Awe can help calm the nervous system, reduce inflammation and foster a sense of community (even if you experience the emotion alone). People who took awe walks, one study found, felt more upbeat and hopeful than walkers who did not.
These walks also have restorative benefits, said Dr. Keltner, who has seen the positive effects firsthand. When his daughter was younger, she had anxiety and became preoccupied with dying, he said. So they began to take nightly awe walks to a giant cedar tree in their neighborhood. Together, they touched the tree's bark and talked about the cycle of life. As the months passed, this ritual connected them to nature and each other, Dr. Keltner said, as his daughter went from being "freaked out about dying" to getting "a sense of 'this is just part of life."'
"An awe walk can be a healing ritual," he said. "Twelve years later, I still walk to touch that tree."
Ready to try it? Here's how:
Decide on a place.
You can pick somewhere you've never been, Dr. Keltner said, adding that you're more likely to feel awe in an environment where the sights and sounds are unfamiliar -- a local park or trail you've never visited, a new neighborhood in your city or town, a body of water if you live near one. Or you can travel to a familiar spot and imagine that you're seeing it for the first time, he said.
No matter where you go, the fleeting beauty of a dawn sky or sunset has been shown to cultivate awe.
Once you've arrived at your spot, give yourself at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted time. If you can, turn off your phone. Then take a few deep breaths "to shift out of our hyper task-focused mind," Dr. Keltner said. Breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for six. Do this for a few minutes. Then start walking.
Pay attention to your senses.
Heading outside hoping to be awed can seem daunting, but try not to put too much pressure on yourself, Dr. Keltner said. Instead, he said, just be open.
Take in the sights, sounds and scents that usually escape your awareness but have the potential to raise goose bumps. When something catches your attention, "stop and pause and feel," Dr. Keltner said.
Sense the wind on your face. Touch the petals of a flower. Tune into the sounds of what Rachel Carson, the American marine biologist and author of "Silent Spring," once called the "living music" of "insect orchestras."
Dr. Keltner often gives his students an assignment: to simply notice the sky. His students examine the colors, clouds and how the vista can change in an instant. "They're blown away," he said. "They'll say, 'I haven't looked at the sky in years."'
Start small.
When you're on your walk, get in the habit of pausing and homing in on a detail -- a ripple on a lake, an ant moving industriously through the grass -- then, slowly expand your field of vision. The shift in focus to vastness can sometimes inspire awe, Dr. Keltner said.
Or pan from the ground to the sky. If you're in a city or the suburbs, he said, fix your gaze on a window or doorway, and then move it up. (Until I tried this exercise, I'd never noticed how many building rooftops in my town had statues and carvings of animals, human faces and even gargoyles.)
What Dr. Keltner calls "part-to-whole" focusing can apply to people, too. If you're in a crowd, start with one person and zoom out to take in the whole system of human activity, he said. "Walk by a pickup basketball game, and you've got enough humanity for a Shakespearean play."
I'm an early riser, so I've started taking awe walks at dawn. I watch the sky change from violet to orange to fuchsia, and have seen a small colony of bees wake up and start to work. I even discovered a nest of baby robins, lodged snugly in a juniper bush two blocks from my house. Now I walk there every morning and listen to their faint, reedy chirping.
Like Dr. Keltner's strolls with his daughter to the cedar tree, seeing the nest every day sustains me, somehow. I feel a twinge that the robins will leave soon. Until I find another wondrous sight to delight me, I'll keep walking -- phone stashed, eyes and ears open.
Mindfulness is a good first step toward shutting off the chatter in your brain and tuning into your senses. Below, you'll find a guided walking meditation from Dan Harris, co-founder of the "Ten Percent Happier" podcast and app.
Need motivation to lace up your shoes and hit the pavement? Trick your brain.
Three-quarters of Americans don't meet the recommended guidelines for aerobic and strengthening exercises. As Connie Chang reports, many experts say the key to better and more regular workouts is not in your body, but in your mind. Here are a few tools to goad your reluctant brain into action.

Anger Over a Comedian's Malaysia Joke Escalates Into a Diplomatic Incident: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Jocelyn Chia's line about the 2014 missing airliner was part of a Comedy Cellar set in April. But when video was posted this week, outrage poured in.
At the Comedy Cellar in Manhattan this spring, the stand-up comedian Jocelyn Chia performed a routine that she had reliably included in her sets for more than a year, about the historical animosity between Singapore, the city-state in Southeast Asia where she was raised, and its neighbor Malaysia.
But when Chia and the club posted a clip from the April 7 set to TikTok and Instagram this week, it provoked a heated backlash. The 89-second video showed the comedian bantering with an audience member who volunteered that he is Malaysian. And it concluded with Chia's making light of the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people onboard.
Angry Malaysians flooded the comment sections on Chia's social media accounts. The Comedy Cellar received 4,000 one-star reviews on Google almost overnight and its website was hacked, its owner said. TikTok removed a clip of the joke from Chia's account, flagging it as "hateful behavior" and a violation of its community guidelines, according to a screenshot Chia shared with The New York Times.
Even Singapore's minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, weighed in, condemning Chia and apologizing for her "horrendous comments" in a tweet noting, "She certainly does not speak for Singaporeans."
The incident demonstrated the fraught line toed by comedians when edgy routines are removed from their natural habitats in dark, late-night, alcohol-lubricated clubs and posted to social media for all to see. Managers of the Comedy Cellar and the West Side Comedy Club, where Chia has performed, said they had received or been threatened with negative reviews as part of the backlash. Chia said that her family and friends had received hate messages.
At a club, "you can get away with saying stuff that's kind of outrageous," said Noam Dworman, the Comedy Cellar's owner. "You can't put that same moment into a small screen that you're watching over morning coffee."
But Chia, who performed this week in New York and has future gigs planned, said in an interview on Friday that the fallout had not damaged her career. "I'm in no way canceled in America, in any sense of the word," she said. "Now people want to come see me."
Chia, who was born in Boston and held joint American-Singaporean citizenship until adulthood, was a lawyer who decided her true calling lay in stand-up comedy.
Her extended routine, which the clip abbreviated, mentions the former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew and how he appeared to tear up in 1965 when the city-state was expelled from Malaysia "because he thought we were not going to survive," Chia says in the video. "But then 40 years later, we became a first-world country. And you guys, Malaysia, what are you now? Still a developing country. Awww."
Likening the 1965 rupture to a breakup, she imagined Malaysia trying to woo Singapore back and explaining it hadn't visited because "my airplanes cannot fly." Then she added, to laughter, "What? Malaysia Airlines going missing not funny?"
The complete routine has been one of her most successful recent bits, she said. "It gets raucous," she said. "The full bit is well set up -- I build up emotion."
The set seemed to set off an international incident only after its appearance this week on social media. Following the backlash, Chia removed the clip at the Comedy Cellar's request, then reposted it to TikTok without the club's logo. That's when TikTok removed it.
"I didn't want the haters to think they had won and got me to back down," she said. "Audiences at the Comedy Cellar see the best comedians and they love it, so how can I be embarrassed by it?"
Felicia Madison, the managing partner and talent booker at the West Side Comedy Club in Manhattan, said she had been threatened with negative reviews by fans who figured out that Chia had appeared there. "We're a pretty new club," she said. "When people want to see if they should go, they look at reviews."
Dworman argued that the spate of negative reviews -- which dragged down the Comedy Cellar's overall rating before Google restored it -- went beyond people exercising their right to be offended.
"You're entitled to dislike it and complain about it, but they're trying to make it too risky for me to allow this woman to speak onstage," he said. "That's not a refutation of what she said, or a thoughtful appeal to the fact that this is something she should consider was too hurtful. This is essentially using brute force to make the other side say 'uncle."'

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Universities, Meet Monasteries," by Molly Worthen (Opinion guest essay, May 28):
Dr. Worthen's essay resonated deeply with me. I am a tutor and the incoming dean of St. John's College, Santa Fe, one of the oldest colleges in America, a college with an enduring commitment to seminar-style discussion and the close reading of the Great Books.
Without fanfare, year after year, St. John's continues to offer a program of study that requires little more than a great book, a seminar table and the participants around that table.
St. John's is not a monastery, but it does provide a cloister where devices and the pull of the virtual world have no place. The education requires the students to be present to their thoughts, to the comments of their classmates, to the beauty of the texts. In doing so they experience self-discovery and deep conversation.
It becomes increasingly clear that this kind of education, Luddite though it may appear, is not a turning back, but a looking forward. It is one of the few places available for our young people to face, as Dr. Worthen put it, that these devices are our tools, not our masters.
Sarah Davis
Santa Fe, N.M.
To the Editor:
The idea of creating a "monastery" within a larger university has some merit, especially given how distracted so many of our young adults are with their phones, computers and a nearly ubiquitous digital "panopticon" that has become part of not only college, but also where and how we live.
For Molly Worthen's concept to work, however, it would be necessary to get the full buy-in of the college faculty and administration, because everything they do is now fully digital, including homework, essay submissions, various e-chalkboards and even virtual office hours. College administration also operates its entire function digitally, including financial aid and all record-keeping.
This reminds me of Saul Bellow's introduction to Allan Bloom's classic 1987 book "The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students." Bellow recommended that, as much as possible, society's "backflow," as he put it, be kept off campus so students can concentrate on learning fundamental skills and develop their own powers of mind.
This was way before the internet and iPhones, and is timeless advice, whether digital or not.
Matthew G. Andersson
Clearwater, Fla.
To the Editor:
Molly Worthen made a sound argument for the creation of classes and programs at universities that limit and remove technology from students' daily lives.

To the Editor:
I was a Catholic high school boarding student at Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit from 1965 to 1969. We had to observe "grand silence" every night from prayers, around 9, until we sat down at breakfast the next morning, and we were not permitted to listen to the radio or watch TV while at the seminary.
Although we were not monks, in preparation to eventually become priests, we were cut off from "the world" and were taught to be "in the world but not of it."
Molly Worthen captures well the unexpected benefits of an imposed silence in the cases she describes at universities. Although it felt strange living that "vow of silence" as a teenager -- long before the age of the internet and iPhones! -- I treasure the lessons learned by living periods of each day in silence.
Many of my friends over the years have had nonstop background sounds of music playing on the radio all day (and night) or switched on the TV as soon as they awoke each morning. No car ride was possible without the radio blaring. I choose carefully which programs I listen to on the radio and am selective about my TV viewing -- only at night for the news and some favorite shows on Netflix and Paramount+.
In the end, I did not become a priest, but I cherish the value of a somewhat "monkish" existence, living comfortably with silence and deep into my own thoughts. As a university instructor, I encourage my students to learn to do the same.

Prizes in the Arts Do Have Meaning and Value
To the Editor:
Re "What Prizes Mean (and What They Don't)," by Roger Rosenblatt (Opinion guest essay, May 28):
In the late 1980s, a critics' prize for live theater in the Dallas-Fort Worth area was established by me and a few other reviewers: the Dallas Theater Critics Forum Awards. It eventually died because of Covid and because of the decimation of jobs in the media, especially for professional critics.
But at the time, there wasn't anything like it in the area. We didn't award single "best of" prizes, nor did we use the term "winning." That's because the fundamental reason for establishing such a prize was simple enough.
Live theater is one of the most ephemeral of arts. It mostly vanishes. But 20 or 30 years on, after the memories have faded -- memories of all the work that talented writers, actors, designers and directors had put into a production -- the artists would have at least this one thing to point to.
It would be proof that, at one point in time, a group of relatively knowledgeable people felt that what I did was worth this public acknowledgment.

To the Editor:
When I was 24, I won a Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Poetry Fellowship. At the time I was just starting an uncertain career as a visiting professor at a small liberal arts college in Indiana. After a few months at the college, I knew I had to leave.
Though I loved my students and colleagues, I couldn't abide living in a town where the number of Confederate flags outweighed the number of other Black people I saw in a given week. Having the money from my fellowship allowed me to move back to Chicago and purchase a home.
My story is far more mild than others. I know friends who have used prize money to exit abusive relationships or access health care for chronic illnesses.
Prizes can furnish people with resources and access to live their lives. Until we live in a country with a more robust commitment to caring for people, if you find prizes distasteful, then resolve to not apply or accept them in hopes that someone with more pressing needs might get one.

A Climate Question
To the Editor:
Re "Arctic May Lose Nearly All Summer Sea Ice as Early as 2030s" (news article, June 7):
Sadly, it's conceivable that someday in the not too distant future, a parent will speak the idiom "Just the tip of the iceberg" to their child, and the child will ask, "What's an iceberg?" Lord help us.

Full text: Responses to Molly Worthen's essay about removing technology from students' daily lives.
To the Editor:
Re "Universities, Meet Monasteries," by Molly Worthen (Opinion guest essay, May 28):
Dr. Worthen's essay resonated deeply with me. I am a tutor and the incoming dean of St. John's College, Santa Fe, one of the oldest colleges in America, a college with an enduring commitment to seminar-style discussion and the close reading of the Great Books.
Without fanfare, year after year, St. John's continues to offer a program of study that requires little more than a great book, a seminar table and the participants around that table.
St. John's is not a monastery, but it does provide a cloister where devices and the pull of the virtual world have no place. The education requires the students to be present to their thoughts, to the comments of their classmates, to the beauty of the texts. In doing so they experience self-discovery and deep conversation.
It becomes increasingly clear that this kind of education, Luddite though it may appear, is not a turning back, but a looking forward. It is one of the few places available for our young people to face, as Dr. Worthen put it, that these devices are our tools, not our masters.
Sarah Davis
Santa Fe, N.M.
To the Editor:
The idea of creating a "monastery" within a larger university has some merit, especially given how distracted so many of our young adults are with their phones, computers and a nearly ubiquitous digital "panopticon" that has become part of not only college, but also where and how we live.
For Molly Worthen's concept to work, however, it would be necessary to get the full buy-in of the college faculty and administration, because everything they do is now fully digital, including homework, essay submissions, various e-chalkboards and even virtual office hours. College administration also operates its entire function digitally, including financial aid and all record-keeping.
This reminds me of Saul Bellow's introduction to Allan Bloom's classic 1987 book "The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students." Bellow recommended that, as much as possible, society's "backflow," as he put it, be kept off campus so students can concentrate on learning fundamental skills and develop their own powers of mind.
This was way before the internet and iPhones, and is timeless advice, whether digital or not.
Matthew G. Andersson

To the Editor:
Molly Worthen made a sound argument for the creation of classes and programs at universities that limit and remove technology from students' daily lives.
TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat have already affected our collective attention span. They are designed to keep their users on the platform as much as possible; the revenue the companies generate from endless advertising is their lifeblood.
Look no further than the couple at a restaurant, glued to their phones, or the student trying to complete an assignment at 11 at night, who for hours was scrolling through a TikTok feed.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sarah Berkman and Phillip Dinner were standing in a stairwell in New York when they bonded over Nashville. A little over a year later, they began living together in Nashville ... with her parents.
Phillip Michael Dinner first caught Sarah Tedi Berkman's eye at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York on Feb. 6, 2019. He was heading in, and she was heading out. He was wearing a hat that read "NASH" when they met at the bottom of the stairs.
"I recognized the Nashville brand," Ms. Berkman said of the local apparel store.
A Nashville native herself, she asked if he was, too. He was not, but was moving there in two weeks. They chatted, mostly about hockey. He was in a hockey camp with Colton Sissons, who now plays with the Nashville Predators, when they were both in high school. She had always been a huge fan of the N.H.L. team.
As she left, she jokingly told him to say hello to Mr. Sissons and gave Mr. Dinner her Instagram handle.
He didn't have his phone on him, "so I didn't think much of it until a few days later when I got a DM," Ms. Berkman said. "I told Colton you said hello," it read. Mr. Dinner had not actually contacted the athlete, but "she was beautiful and had the best personality in our short conversation, so I wanted to flirt with her," he said.
After that, the two began texting. Two months later, when Ms. Berkman was back in Nashville for her sister's wedding on April 13, she went by Mr. Dinner's apartment for a drink afterward. "I was still wearing a full-length bridesmaid's dress," Ms. Berkman said. "Turns out I didn't have much energy because I fell asleep on his couch within 10 minutes."
Mr. Dinner woke her up and said, "You should probably go back to your hotel."
They got another shot at love the next morning when they met for coffee and chicken biscuits, "the perfect hangover cure," Ms. Berkman said.
Later that day, Ms. Berkman's flight back to New York was canceled, so she returned to his apartment to watch the season premiere of "Game of Thrones," a show they both love.
They spent most of 2019 getting to know each other from a distance while dating other people. But "every time I was home in Nashville, we would meet up," Ms. Berkman said.
During a visit in mid-December, they went to Lockeland Table, a popular Nashville restaurant, for dinner. "We discussed what we were doing from a relationship standpoint," she said. "That really felt like a defining moment for us."
After that conversation, Mr. Dinner texted his father that he was going to marry Ms. Berkman one day. By January, they were officially a couple.
In March 2020, when Ms. Berkman was visiting Mr. Dinner in Nashville, she introduced her parents to Mr. Dinner for the first time over dinner at 5th & Taylor, a restaurant. That "was supposed to be the extent of their time together," Ms. Berkman said. But the Covid-19 pandemic changed all that.
When the lockdown began that month, Ms. Berkman did not return to New York and instead moved in with her parents. And because her parents, both doctors, were not comfortable with the couple traveling between homes, Mr. Dinner joined them.

At the end of May, once his home in a new development was ready, the couple moved into it. In January 2022, they moved to an apartment in the Rose Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, where they still live.
Ms. Berkman, 30, grew up in Nashville and is the manager of influencer and partnerships at the clothing company American Eagle. She holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in psychology and community action social change.
Mr. Dinner, 30, who grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Simsbury, Conn., is a senior associate at AllianceBernstein, an asset management firm based in Nashville. He holds a bachelor's in finance from Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.
On Nov. 20, 2021, Mr. Dinner rented out L.A. Jackson, a bar and restaurant on the rooftop of the hotel Thompson Nashville, for a private proposal. Afterward, he surprised Ms. Berkman with an engagement party with her closest friends and family at the Virgin Hotels Nashville.
"He had my friend invite me to a fake event in Nashville, an invitation I initially turned down until my other friends, and my sister, convinced me I should go," Ms. Berkman said.
As the elevator doors opened to the rooftop, "I hear Harry Styles's 'Adore You' playing," Ms. Berkman recalled. "Then, I see the hallway is filled with flower petals and candles."
The two were wed on May 27 in the backyard of her parents' home. "It's where our story developed," Ms. Berkman said. "There's something really nostalgic and sweet about getting married there."
Shana Goldstein Mackler, Ms. Berkman's childhood rabbi from the Temple Congregation Ohabai Sholom in Nashville, officiated. About 140 guests attended, and a reception followed at the restaurant 5th & Taylor.
The best moment of the night, Mr. Dinner said, was when Ms. Berkman read her vows to him: "She finally admitted I'm funny."

Wellness Chatbot Is Taken Offline After Distributing 'Problematic' Eating Advice: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Mccarthy, Lauren

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The artificial intelligence tool, named Tessa, was presented by the National Eating Disorders Association as a way to discover coping skills. But activists say it instead veered into problematic weight-loss advice.
The idea behind a chatbot project funded by the National Eating Disorders Association was that technology could be unleashed to help people seeking guidance about eating behaviors, available around the clock.
Their creation was named Tessa, and the organization invited people to chat with it in an Instagram post last year, describing it as "a wellness chatbot, helping you build resilience and self-awareness by introducing coping skills at your convenience." In March, the organization said it would shut down a human-staffed helpline and let the bot stand on its own.
But when Alexis Conason, a psychologist and eating disorder specialist, tested the chatbot, she found reason for concern.
Dr. Conason told it that she had gained weight "and really hate my body," specifying that she had "an eating disorder," in a chat she shared on social media. Tessa still recommended the standard advice of noting "the number of calories" and adopting a "safe daily calorie deficit" -- which, Dr. Conason said, is "problematic" advice for a person with an eating disorder.
"Any focus on intentional weight loss is going to be exacerbating and encouraging to the eating disorder," she said.
Kendrin Sonneville, an associate professor and public health researcher at the University of Michigan, explained that for some people, "hyper-fixation on weight control can take innocent dieting or nutrition advice to a place that gets extreme and gets out of someone's control," which can harm their mind and body.
"There's no way to exit an eating disorder if you're actively trying to lose weight to control your body," Dr. Sonneville said, as part of treatment for the illness is learning to trust "internal wisdom" related to eating, whereas "calorie counting and intentional weight loss is relying on external rules."
The association, the largest nonprofit dedicated to helping people affected by eating disorders, announced last week that it was investigating the now-suspended A.I.-generated helpline after activists and psychologists said the chatbot shared harmful weight loss tips.
In a statement last week, the association said "the current version of the Tessa Chatbot, running the Body Positive program, may have given information that was harmful and unrelated to the program." It added: "We are investigating this immediately and have taken down that program until further notice for a complete investigation."
Elizabeth Thompson, the chief executive, said in an email on Sunday that the nonprofit is "waiting for an explanation about how that content was introduced into a closed program" from X2AI, the platform and development company used for Tessa, because it deviated from "a very specific algorithm" that was written by eating disorder experts.
Michiel Rauws, the founder and chief executive of X2AI, now Cass, said in an email on Wednesday that Tessa had a lot of guardrails, was restricted to specific topics and gave disclaimers of consulting a professional. "Even though one message is too many, only in 0.1 percent of the time this feature did not stick to guidelines," he said.
In addressing the potential consequences of the bot's misfiring, Dr. Conason underscored that the vast majority of people struggling with eating disorders are not underweight and that gaining weight can be a "sign of success in treatment" that may be "very difficult for people to tolerate."
Eating disorders are among the deadliest mental illnesses, experts say. In the past three years, the pandemic introduced new hurdles for people managing difficult relationships with food and eating disorders among teenagers worsened.
New studies have shown that people's assumptions about eating disorders are often wrong, bringing to light that many larger-bodied people are starving themselves. Binge eating disorder, the most common eating disorder in the United States, continues to be underrecognized by doctors as well as the general public.
A nationwide escalation in demand for treatment has been met with a shortage of providers, leading some mental health organizations to supplement care with chatbots and artificial intelligence that present a dilemma in public health: Is something better than nothing?
In March, the National Eating Disorders Association notified the staff members of a telephone helpline that the organization had operated for more than 20 years that they would be laid off, shortly after they had formed a union. At the time, the staff was told that the organization would "wind down the helpline as currently operating" and "transition to Tessa, the AI-assisted technology, expected around June 1," NPR reported.
Ms. Thompson said that there was an "onslaught" of 28,000 messages to Tessa, which first became available through the association in February 2022, over Memorial Day weekend. In the 15 months prior, more than 5,000 people had used the program, she said.
Ellen Fitzsimmons-Craft, a professor and psychologist who helped create Tessa, said the chatbot was "was never designed as a one-to-one replacement for the helpline, it's a totally different service." Instead, she said it was envisioned and shown to be effective as a preventive tool for people considered to be at high risk of developing eating disorders.
Sharon Maxwell, who is in recovery and advocates for people with eating disorders of all body types, also shared on social media portions of a conversation she had with Tessa. She engaged the bot of out curiosity, she said, and asked specific questions about eating healthy and weight loss.
"It gave me 10 tips, three of which are restrictive," Ms. Maxwell said in an interview. She added that healthy eating recommendations "might sound benign to the general public but to someone recovering from an eating disorder it is a slippery slope."
Among other suggestions, Tessa recommended using a scale once a week and tracking body measurements, energy levels and mood, she said. The bot told her that measurements could be tracked with skin fold calipers and offered suggestions of where to buy one after Ms. Maxwell replied that she "used to use one of those back when I was in my eating disorder."
Tessa also told her that "acceptance and weight loss are not mutually exclusive."
Joanna Kandel, the founder and chief executive of the National Alliance for Eating Disorders, said the organization's helpline received calls from people who were very upset by their interactions with Tessa, and she expressed concerns about outsourcing mental health care.
"When someone is reaching out for help and they are in their eating disorder and they are given content not only that's not helpful with connecting them to care but can be triggering, that can do so much more harm than good," Ms. Kandel said.
"That we're even talking about chatbots as a way to disseminate mental health treatment or prevention or mental health care at all," said Dr. Conason, "it really highlights the crisis we're in with the mental health epidemic in the country."

France Shocked by Stabbing Critically Injuring 4 Children: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A local prosecutor said there was "no apparent sign of a terrorist motive" after a knife-wielding man violently assaulted people in a park in the southeastern city of Annecy.
A knife-wielding man stabbed four children and two adults at a park and a playground in southeastern France on Thursday, in an attack that horrified the country and that President Emmanuel Macron called "absolutely cowardly."
The authorities said that a suspect, a Syrian asylum seeker who arrived in France last fall, had been arrested in the attack, which took place in Annecy, a city of about 130,000 people in the French Alps. Most of the wounded were hospitalized with critical injuries.
The incident was not being treated as a terrorist incident so far, the authorities said.
The brazen stabbing of very young children -- ages 22 months to 3 years -- shattered a peaceful morning in one of Annecy's bucolic lakeside parks, and quickly sparked outrage across the country, where past attacks have left deep scars. It also set off political recriminations over immigration.
"The nation is in shock," Mr. Macron said on Twitter.
Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, who hurried to Annecy after the stabbings, said the victims had been "savagely attacked."
Line Bonnet-Mathis, the city's public prosecutor, said that the suspect was being questioned and that he had acted alone.
Ms. Bonnet-Mathis said the victims were in "extremely fragile" condition and had been transferred to hospitals in the French city of Grenoble and in Geneva, in neighboring Switzerland. One of the injured children was British and one was Dutch.
The attack occurred just before 10 a.m. in an area with two parks, Les Jardins de l'Europe and Le Pâquier, that borders a glacier-formed lake surrounded by mountains.
Anthony Le Tallec, a former professional soccer player in Annecy, said in an Instagram story from the park, where he filmed police officers and emergency services at the scene, that he had been jogging when he saw dozens of people running in the other direction.
"There was a mom who told me: 'Run! Someone is stabbing everyone. He stabbed children,"' Mr. Le Tallec said. He then moved out of the way as the assailant, being chased by the police, ran toward him, he said. The attacker rushed up to an older man nearby and stabbed him, Mr. Le Tallec added.
"It's crazy to see this in Annecy," he said.
Ms. Borne, the prime minister, said that the suspect was homeless and that he had obtained refugee status in Sweden a decade ago. He had also applied for asylum in France, she said, but was refused because of his existing status in Sweden.
Ms. Borne said that the suspect had no criminal record, had never been flagged by French intelligence services and had no known psychiatric disorders.
Ms. Bonnet-Mathis, the prosecutor, said initial tests had found that the suspect did not appear to have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the attack.
The assailant was armed with a single switchblade knife, but one of the adult victims was also hit by a bullet when the police fired at the attacker, Ms. Bonnet-Mathis said.
Asked about the suspect's religion -- some French media reported that the suspect had told French asylum authorities that he was a Christian and that he was wearing a cross at the time of the attack -- Ms. Bonnet-Mathis declined to comment.
Laurent Wauquiez, who presides over the Regional Council of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, the region that includes Annecy, said that the attack happened as families were pushing children in strollers and high-school students were exercising nearby.
"Everyone is extremely shocked," Mr. Wauquiez said. "It's a garden, there is a school right nearby, facing a lake that is a haven of peace. Nobody can imagine this barbarity."
Mathilde Fuzat, an 18-year-old high school student, said she had been with classmates in the park when she saw a commotion nearby.
"We didn't know what to do," she told Le Dauphiné Libéré, a local newspaper. Then, she said, "I saw a mom pick her child up from the ground, and that's when we all understood that it was very, very serious."
Ms. Fuzat described a scene of chaos, as people ran from the assailant with children in their arms, warning bystanders that he had a knife. Her teacher quickly urged the class to leave.
"I was stressed, I was very panicked," she said.
France's lower house of Parliament observed a minute of silence, briefly interrupting fiery debates among lawmakers on Mr. Macron's pension overhaul.
Terrorist attacks have receded from the headlines in France in recent years, but the country is still on high alert.
France was struck by large-scale Islamist terrorist attacks in 2015 and in 2016, followed by a string of smaller but still deadly shootings and stabbings in subsequent years, often carried out by lone assailants.
In April, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on the news channel BFMTV that the security forces had thwarted 41 potential terrorist attacks since 2017, including about a dozen since 2020. Most had been planned by people with radical Islamist views, he said.
Attacks targeting children are rare in France.
In 1993, a masked gunman held toddlers hostage for two days at their kindergarten in a suburb of Paris, but he ultimately released them unharmed before being killed by police officers. And in 2012, a radical Islamist gunman went on a shooting spree around the southwestern city of Toulouse, killing a rabbi and three children at a Jewish school. The police fatally shot the attacker several days later.
The assault on Thursday quickly fueled political debates over immigration, a sensitive issue in France.
Mr. Macron's government has tried for months to introduce a bill that would make it easier to deport people who are in France illegally while also extending work opportunities for migrants with needed skills. But the bill has been repeatedly postponed, as it remains unclear whether the government can secure a majority to pass it.
Some politicians were quick to criticize the government's track record on immigration after the stabbing on Thursday, even as details of the attack had yet to emerge.
"Instead of lamenting every new crime, let's put a stop to mass immigration!" Olivier Marleix, a top Republican lawmaker, said on Twitter on Thursday. Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally party, said that France needed to "regain control of a situation that is slipping through the government's fingers."
Ms. Borne, the prime minister, noted that the suspect had obtained asylum in Sweden and could therefore legally travel around Europe's visa-free, 27-country Schengen zone.
"Before getting carried away on these issues, we need to wait for the investigation to take place," she said.

Season and Era Come to an End at the Met Opera: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the 2022-23 season ends, the country's largest performing arts institution looks ahead to a future of fewer titles.
The Metropolitan Opera's 2022-23 season may well have been the end of an era.
Since September, the Met, which closes for the summer on Saturday, has put on 22 titles -- 23 if you count both stagings of Mozart's "Magic Flute," one complete in German and one an English-language holiday abridgment. As a repertory house and the country's largest performing arts organization, it juggles multiple works at a time. On some weekends, it's been possible to see four different operas in 48 hours.
But is there enough of an audience to fill so many performances in a 4,000-seat theater?
Ticket sales have been robust for some new productions, even of contemporary works. But revivals, less obviously newsworthy and less widely promoted, are no longer sure things -- especially slightly off-the-beaten-path stuff like Mozart's "Idomeneo" or Verdi's "Don Carlo."
In an attempt to make ends meet, the Met has raided its endowment and plans to put on 10 percent fewer performances next season, which will feature just 18 staged operas (six of them written in the past 30 years). The days of being America's grand repertory company, of 20-plus titles a year, could be slowly entering the rearview mirror.
So it was fitting that, last month, the Met said farewell to one of the shows that typified the era that's ending: its "Aida" from the 1980s. The production was typical Met: hardly cheap but sturdy and flexible, into which you could toss singers with relatively little rehearsal. The company's model has depended on a core of stagings of the standards like this -- ones which could be mounted, and sell well, year after year.
If there's less of a year-after-year opera audience, though, the only solution may be to do less.
It's melancholy to look back on the past season and realize that my two favorite performances were the kind of thing that might go by the wayside in the Met to come. They were revivals of works by no means obscure, but not nearly as famous as, say, "Carmen": Donizetti's gentle romantic comedy "L'Elisir d'Amore" and Shostakovich's ferocious satire-tragedy "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk."
This has been the glory of the Met: the love, care, craft and experience that go into works as different as these two -- starkly contrasting titles, both presented at the highest level. In "Elisir," the tenor Javier Camarena and the soprano Golda Schultz were all tenderness, but were lit, as if from within, with a lively spirit by the conductor Michele Gamba, making his company debut.
The conductor of "Lady Macbeth," Keri-Lynn Wilson, was also making her debut, and showed mastery of Shostakovich's score, which is in a savage, if often eerily beautiful, mode that would have stunned Donizetti.
Neither run was nearly a sellout, but the season would been immeasurably more barren without them.
The new vision that the company will be pursuing next season has a silver lining in its doubling down on contemporary opera. Sales for recent works have been pretty robust, though it's unclear whether they've done well because people like them or because they've tended to be among the splashy, expensively publicized new productions rather than the perennial chestnuts.
But even if successful at the box office, the contemporary pieces this season have not been highlights. This spring, "Champion," a boxing melodrama by Terence Blanchard -- who also composed "Fire Shut Up in My Bones," which opened the Met's 2021-22 season -- was musically stilted and dramatically stodgy. Last fall, Kevin Puts's score for "The Hours," based on the novel and film, was relentlessly, exhaustingly tear-jerking.
While Puts's work was a vehicle for a trio of divas, including Renée Fleming and Kelli O'Hara, the real star was the third: the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato as a brooding but dryly witty Virginia Woolf, her voice mellow yet penetrating.
Hers was one of the performances of the year. Another was the mezzo Samantha Hankey's alert, youthful Octavian in Strauss's "Der Rosenkavalier." Hankey was joined by the Marschallin of the radiant soprano Lise Davidsen, who kept her immense voice carefully restrained for much of this long, talky opera before unleashing its full force in the final minutes.
In a clunky new production of Wagner's "Lohengrin" by the director François Girard, the tenor Piotr Beczala seemed almost to float -- utterly assured and elegant in the otherworldly, treacherously exposed title role. This is a singer nearing 60 and doing his best work.
But the coup of the year may have been the Met debut of the conductor Nathalie Stutzmann. Leading one new production of a Mozart opera is hard enough, especially as an introduction to the company -- but two, simultaneously? And Stutzmann's work in both Ivo van Hove's austere "Don Giovanni" and Simon McBurney's antic "Magic Flute" was superb: lithe but rich, propulsive without being rushed or stinting these scores' lyricism.
How was she repaid? Before "Flute" opened, Stutzmann was quoted in The New York Times remarking that McBurney's production, which raises the pit almost to stage level, lets the musicians see what's going on rather than keeping them, as usual, in the "back of a cave" where there's "nothing more boring." Jokey and innocuous. But for some reason, the musicians flew to social media and condemned her for accusing them of playing bored.
Even worse, the Met's music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, rather than standing up for his colleague or trying to resolve the conflict behind the scenes, publicly cheered this unseemly pile-on, adding seven clapping emojis to an Instagram post by the orchestra. He and the musicians should be ashamed of themselves; Stutzmann should be celebrated.
Next season, while curtailed, is hardly free of ambition, offering a profusion of recent works and some intriguing repertory pieces, like Verdi's "La Forza del Destino" (not seen at the Met since 2006), Puccini's "La Rondine" and Wagner's "Tannhäuser."
This new approach to programming is an experiment. Revivals of "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" and "The Hours" will test whether contemporary operas have legs beyond their premiere runs, and we'll see if the trims to the season increase sales for what remains.
Hopefully, it all keeps the Met alive and vibrant. But whatever the coming years bring will likely be quite different. It was oddly, sadly appropriate that the veteran soprano Angela Gheorghiu, absent from the company for eight years and set to return for two performances of "Tosca" in April, came down with Covid-19 and had to cancel.
This is a new phase, fate seemed to say, and the old divas -- at least the ones not named Renée -- need not apply.

These Put the 'Show' in 'Fashion Show': [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chanel in Los Angeles, Dior in Mexico, Gucci in Seoul. Clothes are just a tiny part of the content.
In 1964, John Cheever published a short story called "The Swimmer" in which a seemingly happy suburbanite endeavors to swim his way home across New York's Westchester County, by going from one backyard pool to the next in an odyssey that reveals the truth of his world.
It's a scenario that sprang to mind during the last cruise (or resort) season, a monthlong series of extravaganzas in far-flung destinations that came to an end last week. It was not hard to imagine fashionistas hieing their way from show to show to show before finally returning home.
They could have started in Los Angeles with Chanel on May 9, moved on to Seoul with Gucci, on to Mexico City for Dior, then to northern Italy for Louis Vuitton (which had confusingly held a separate pre-fall show in Seoul just a few weeks before) and Alberta Ferretti, ending in Rio de Janeiro on June 1 with Carolina Herrera. Many of them may have been treated to their trips by the brands themselves (The New York Times does not accept press trips, so yours truly watches the shows on the computer), caravanning around the globe as if the pandemic was a speck in the rearview mirror.
In other words, despite all the lip service paid in recent seasons to reducing the excesses of fashion, this was one of the most mileage-intensive, blowout seasons on record, one that widened the gulf between the mega-brands that can orchestrate such spectacles and the rest of the industry.
Each brand, it seemed, was trying to one-up the others in offering "experiences" complete with dinners and famous guests dressed to the nines, selfie-ing away in extraordinary places: Jaden Smith, Eileen Gu and Emma Stone at Isola Bella, Italy, the Borromeo family's private island (Vuitton); Naomi Watts, Alicia Keys and Riley Keough at the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso, once the school where Frida Kahlo studied and met Diego Rivera and now a museum (Dior); Kristen Stewart, G-Dragon and Sofia Richie at the Paramount Studios lot (Chanel).
Rarely has it been so clear that when it comes to fashion, there is now so much more at stake than just clothes.
It's About Content, Baby
The sheer fact that the press notes for Gucci's fashion fantasia in the 14th-century Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul contained not just a description of the "dialogue between the house's own heritage and the electrifying South Korean impact that influences it today" but also a 36-page document detailing the celebrities and "KOLs" (key opinion leaders) in attendance along with their Instagram, Twitter and TikTok followings, pretty much said it all.
The collection itself, a wetsuits-meets-the-bourgeoisie hybrid of neoprene, logos, suiting and chiffon created by an anonymous team because Gucci's new designer, Sabato De Sarno had not yet arrived, was significantly less striking than the idea that more than 350 million IG followers were granted secondary access to the experience through the postings of the lucky few actually in attendance.
In other words, the show allowed the brand to have its exclusivity -- to flex its power, ability to access a historic site that had never before hosted a fashion show and taste -- and advertise it widely too.
Not to mention court a market that is increasingly important, as K-pop takes over the world and China proves increasingly complicated politically. What better way to show respect, after all, than to go to the source?
That's also partly why Wes Gordon decided to take his first-ever Carolina Herrera cruise show, a bouquet of polka dots, juicy florals and cha-cha frills, to Brazil, in a nod to both the brand's Latin roots as well as the country's voracious appetite for beauty and fragrance.
Also Cultural Cross-pollination
Of course, the destination show also brings other benefits -- like inspiration. Designers have to produce so many collections, so often, that coming up with new ideas every season is pretty much a Sisyphean task. One advantage, then, of the traveling collection is that it comes with a built-in set of potential new ingredients based on paying "homage" to the culture and geography where a brand lands. This is both a necessary show of appreciation in the era of cultural appropriation, though one that can seem more expedient than long-lasting and authentic, and thematically useful.
Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior, in particular, had made a virtue of the trend, positioning her cruise shows as platforms to showcase the work of local artisans and using her power to argue, at least for a season, that skills that have often been dismissed as "craft" deserve the same respect as couture. As a result, she has created a specific identity and reason for being for the Dior cruise collections that no other brand has quite managed.
This season was no different, with six different expert weavers and artisanal groups invited to contribute their work to classic Dior shapes like the Bar jacket; lacy petticoat shirtdresses; and filigree gowns (and to sit in the front row at the show). For a grand finale, designed by the Mexican artist and activist Elina Chauvet, there was a set of 20 white dresses -- muslin toiles, taken from the brand's archives -- embroidered in blood red with hearts and words meant to represent the violence visited on women, their fragility and strength. It was jarring but also unexpectedly effective.
Another kind of conceptual liberation was on view in Nicolas Ghesquière's Louis Vuitton show, which was weird in the best possible way: a bizarro amalgamation of sea creature silhouettes, sci-fi royalty and romance sparked perhaps by the island site but not limited by it. It made for a persuasive argument for getting designers, literally, out of their comfort zone. Free the imagination!
And Haute Merch
Not that it always works. For Virginie Viard of Chanel, a journey to Los Angeles led to what seemed like thoughts of roller-skating on the Venice boardwalk, "Barbie" (Margot Robbie was in attendance), aerobics and related clichés, including palm trees, playsuits and bubblelicious bouclé so saccharine it made the jaw clench. Ms. Viard can lean casually into the soignée -- see one shimmery, simple tank top with a wisp of a black skirt -- when she isn't trying so blindingly hard to be hip, but this was one case when going further afield meant going astray.
Blink in surprise, however, at a particularly lurid aqua warm-up suit and simply cast your eyes somewhere else: to the bright lights and snack carts and movie stars and later a performance by Snoop Dogg. The show around the show was so fabulous, the fact that so much of the collection was more souvenir kitsch than chic was washed away in the rush of fame and fun.
And that, in the end, is the crux of this particular fashion phenomenon. That's the memory dangled, and designed, for purchase. Like any piece of concert merch, these collections tap into the atavistic urge to own a sign that you were there.
Or there-ish.

Very Smart, Very Rich And Getting Very Tough: [Correction]

Full text: It's been a tough run for Meta, and the boss seems to be getting out some aggression with military-style endurance routines and Brazilian jujitsu.
Close your eyes. Picture Mark Zuckerberg. What do you see?
Perhaps you envision the Meta boss and Facebook founder in a gray T-shirt, spotlighted on a Silicon Valley stage. Maybe his cartoonish metaverse avatar hovers before you -- with legs, or without them. Possibly Jesse Eisenberg, the bony actor who played the fledgling tycoon in "The Social Network" (2010), appears in your mind's eye.
But it's unlikely you conjure anything like the image Mr. Zuckerberg posted to Instagram (which Meta owns) and Facebook on Monday.
The mirror selfie shows the social-media billionaire wearing a camouflage flak jacket while glistening faintly with sweat. His neck swells wider than his jaw. His shoulders are capped with muscle. His forearms bulge.
He looks -- to use a scientific term -- completely shredded. He also looks completely focused, like a guy in a Michael Bay movie who just finished a dangerous mission, or at least the Raya profile picture of the actor who plays that guy.
Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a caption that he had just done the Murph Challenge, a Memorial Day workout and fund-raiser named for the Navy SEAL officer Michael P. Murphy, who died in Afghanistan in 2005. The challenge consists of a mile run, followed by 100 pull-ups, followed by 200 push-ups, followed by 300 squats, capped off with another mile run, all while wearing a 20-pound vest.
Just as eye popping as Mr. Zuckerberg's arms was the time he said the brutal routine took him: under 40 minutes. That's an elite time according to Dr. Joshua Appel, the Veterans Affairs physician who helped popularize the workout, which has become a staple in CrossFit gyms.
So when, exactly, did Zuck decide to go Rambo? And why?
Mr. Zuckerberg did not respond to a request for comment about his physical fitness.
"He looks great," said Sam Lessin, a venture capitalist, former Facebook vice president and longtime friend of Mr. Zuckerberg's. "But I don't think he's doing it for looks. I think he's doing it because he's really into jujitsu." (Though Mr. Zuckerberg's photo suggests that he may be feeling himself, at least a little.)
That would be Brazilian jujitsu, the grueling grappling-based combat sport that is a fundamental part of mixed martial arts. In an August 2022 appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience," Mr. Zuckerberg said that he had taken up martial arts during the pandemic, training with Dave Camarillo, a well-known coach in the Bay Area.
"The crazy thing is it really is the best sport," Mr. Zuckerberg told Mr. Rogan at the time. "There's something that's just so primal about it." (Mr. Rogan is a martial arts enthusiast and Ultimate Fighting Championship commentator.)
According to Casey Johnston, a cultural critic who writes frequently about exercise and strength training in her newsletter She's a Beast, sports like Brazilian jujitsu appeal to a desire among Silicon Valley types to reconnect with a primitive fighting spirit, but on their own, highly formalized terms.
"It's like being on a playground with a bully but in this new framework," she said. "It's not quite choreographed but the stakes and the rules are unambiguous."
On May 6, Mr. Zuckerberg competed in his first Brazilian jujitsu event, in Woodside, Calif., where he defeated an Uber engineer and won two medals, and lost consciousness. José Lucas Costa da Silva, a veteran Brazilian jujitsu fighter who refereed one of Mr. Zuckerberg's matches, said that he halted the bout after he heard Mr. Zuckerberg start to snore, a sign of someone who has passed out in a choke hold.
"This is something we are trained to know," said Mr. Costa da Silva, who added that Mr. Zuckerberg was a good sport who was "enjoying the moment."
After this article was published Friday afternoon, both Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Camarillo reached out and said that the Meta boss had not lost consciousness.
"That never happened," Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in an email. According to Mr. Camarillo, Mr. Costa da Silva mistook his student's effortful grunting for snores.
"This was his first tournament, but it didn't seem like it," said Danny Patalot, the chief executive of BJJ Tour, which organized the daylong event at a local high school. "He was aggressive using technique. There was no fear. That's not typical for a white belt competitor at a first tournament."
For Mr. Zuckerberg, who has absorbed a number of metaphorical body blows over the past several years -- including an election meddling scandal, a ghost town metaverse and widespread layoffs -- it is perhaps a revealing time to start fighting back.
Mr. Zuckerberg is, of course, not the first tech titan to add significant amounts of muscle. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, has, in his 50s, developed remarkable biceps, linebacker shoulders and impressive vascularity. But some of Mr. Zuckerberg's friends say the new regimen is not exactly a surprise.
Though Mr. Zuckerberg entered the popular imagination as an indoor cat -- the millennial archnerd outsmarting the strapping regatta princes of Harvard -- the 39-year-old has been devoted to physical activity for much of his life. He was the captain of his prep school fencing team and became an avid runner in the 2010s.
According to Mr. Lessin, Mr. Zuckerberg goes through phases with new sports, including roller hockey and surfing, a hobby that was immortalized in an image of the magnate afloat in Hawaii, a haunting mask of sunscreen slathered on his face.
"He sees them as super-fun side quests," Mr. Lessin said.
Famously competitive, Mr. Zuckerberg is the "great physical instigator" of his friend group, Mr. Lessin said, and frequently proposes physical challenges. "We've been on trips where he'll say, like, 'I'll race you up that mountain."' And on Mr. Rogan's podcast, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he had successfully encouraged many of his friends to train in Brazilian jujitsu with him.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerberg has a passion for benchmarking. In April, he posted a photo of a stopwatch appearing to confirm that he had run five kilometers in under 20 minutes. And though many commenters were skeptical of his Murph Challenge time, Mr. Zuckerberg clarified that he had done a special, easier-but-still-painful version, in which the exercises are performed in circuits.
Also performing a modified version of the Murph challenge: Two of Mr. Zuckerberg's three daughters. He posted a picture of the girls mid-push-up, in the midst of a "quarter-Murph (unweighted)" -- a clarification that the children were not wearing flak jackets.

Full text: Glamour and great menus abound.
Ciao, friends! I'm filling in for our usual host, Nikita. This week, I want to take on what might be the most maligned category in New York dining: the hotel restaurant.
Skepticism is valid -- by nature, a restaurant in a hotel is designed for tourists, not for residents. But over the past few years there's been a boom in honestly good, New Yorker-approved restaurants that just happen to be in boutique hotels. You could spend an entire weekend visiting hotels as dining destinations, rather than as necessary stopovers with middle-of-the-road (at best) food.
Feel free to email Nikita at wheretoeat@nytimes.com with your questions or advice, or just to tell her you missed her this week. (I did!)
Top-Tier Dining Rooms, New and Old ‌‌
If there's one thing a hotel restaurant is going to have, it's glamour. I'm a known hater of Manhattan West, but the scene at Zou Zou's in the Pendry hotel is undeniably enchanting: towering ceilings, velvet banquettes, the works. A spread of Mediterranean dips, served on a mirrored cake stand, makes a worthy appetizer for Yemeni filet mignon kebabs and Wadi Rum jeweled rice.
Le Crocodile, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has to be the most glamorous hotel restaurant of them all, with distinct New York charms: exposed brick walls, arched windows and detailed tile flooring. While the Wythe Hotel dates back only to 2012, it occupies a 122-year-old factory building. The menu, from the folks at the Greenpoint favorite Chez Ma Tante, is all hits: steak frites au poivre, French onion soup and a frisée salad with a poached egg (and smoked eel standing in for lardons).
Rooftop Shrimp and Arak Cocktails in Williamsburg
Williamsburg has become, seemingly overnight, the unofficial neighborhood of the Cool Hotel Restaurant. In the new Moxy Williamsburg is Mesiba, inspired by the restaurant scene in Tel Aviv. You don't even have to walk through the hotel lobby to enter the high-ceilinged dining room, where you'll find tender lamb neck served with Yemeni pancakes; an epic, whole fried fish; and, naturally, cocktails made with Arak.
And last month, Jaffa Cocktail & Raw Bar opened on the indoor-outdoor roof deck at the Hoxton. It's a surprisingly chill (at the time of publication, that is) alternative to Laser Wolf a few flights above. The menu focuses on seafood, like pastrami-spiced yellowtail with vaguely pickle-like grilled cucumber; tuna crudo topped with grated, cured egg yolk; and octopus shakshuka. And, because the bar sits on a Brooklyn rooftop in the year 2023, it serves a frozen drink: the Jaffa Orange, basically a melted Creamsicle with vodka.

Full text: Podiatrists suggest examining your feet year-round and implementing a few other habits during warmer months.
For the past few months, my feet have been sheathed in socks and slippers -- like cave fish, hidden from the light. With summer around the corner, though, it's time for them to emerge. In preparation, I carefully inspect every inch of my feet to ensure they are ready to show to the world.
But when I told Dr. Paul Greenberg, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine, that I give my feet a thorough once-over every spring, he told me to step it up. Your feet should be examined daily, he said, because their condition can provide important warning signs about your overall health.
Suddenly swollen feet can indicate high blood pressure, said Dr. Kirk Geter, the chief of podiatry at Howard University Hospital. Swelling can also be a sign of gout or kidney problems, Dr. Geter added, while tingling and numbness in the feet can indicate diabetes.
So each day, you should inspect the bottoms and tops of your feet -- as well as between your toes -- and wiggle your toes around, Dr. Geter said. Look for cracks in the skin, redness, changes in nail color, numbness, sores that won't heal and swelling, he said.
"And if something doesn't feel right or look right, then you probably need to get it checked out," he added.
Here are a few summer-specific ways to keep your feet healthy.
Rethink flip-flops.
Most flip-flops offer little to no arch, heel and ankle support, said Dr. Stephanie Wu, a professor at the Dr. William M. Scholl College of Podiatric Medicine at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago. Wearing them can exacerbate many foot conditions, such as arch pain and plantar fasciitis, an inflammation of the tight band of tissue on the bottom of the foot.
And, if you do wear flip-flops, don't mow your lawn in them. Emergency room visits involving injuries "where people decide to mow their lawns wearing flip-flops, trip, and end up running the lawn mower over their foot" aren't uncommon, Dr. Wu said.
Protect your feet from germs.
Exposing our feet in summer makes them more prone to infection, Dr. Wu said. And public swimming areas and locker rooms are filled with microorganisms that thrive in warm, damp areas, she said, causing ailments such as athlete's foot and plantar warts. She recommended wearing stable waterproof shoes in those areas.
And, as delightful as a barefoot walk on the beach can be, Dr. Geter (who has extracted sea urchin spikes and shells from patients' feet) suggested donning water shoes.
There's also the matter of hygiene. Even responsible sandal wearers can collect grime on the bottoms of their feet, Dr. Geter said, so clean your feet with an antibacterial wipe when you arrive home to kill pathogens.
Don't forget the sunscreen.
When you're applying sunscreen, make sure to slather your feet, said Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton, an assistant professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. Just like skin on the rest of our body, she said, the tops of the feet and the soles are prone to sunburn and skin cancer.
According to the American Podiatric Medical Association, skin cancers can develop on any part of the feet, including under the toenail. So you should opt for at least 30 SPF sunscreen and remember to reapply often when you're out in the sun.
When is social media use harmful to your child's mental health? Experts weigh in.

A Subway Platform Is His Dance Stage: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: You can tell when Ja'Bowen is feeling a song. The grounded power of his feet -- whether tapping delicate, whispery notes or hitting rhythmic patterns with ferocity and speed -- enlivens an unassuming place: a subway platform.
But beyond his sleek and supple feet, there is simply his presence. With rigor, elegance and humor, he takes the craft of tap seriously while disarming the crowds that pass through his impromptu theater.
Stumbling on Ja'Bowen is like uncovering a New York City art secret. The lucidity of his body and the music that it produces are steadying forces in an unpredictable space. For months now, this Chicago transplant has been bringing quality tap to the uptown F platform at Delancey Street/Essex Street.
What he creates with taps and a wooden board -- his portable stage -- is a reciprocal experience. His dances are containers for waves of energy that pass between him and a crowd. He is a dance artist who makes people smile. Of all ages. In the subway.
"I get real hyped, and then the audience gets real hyped, and then I lay back a little bit and the audience gets a little quiet," he said. "It's like a tennis match going back and forth."
His improvs often start slowly. "If I'm being honest," he said, "sometimes people aren't paying attention or could care less that I'm down there."
When a dancer, or really any performer, needs too much love, I tend to look the other way. Ja'Bowen is different. He can seem lost in his own world, dancing for himself until he feels the people around him drawing closer, looking -- taking a break from social media to watch a live performance. That's when he sends his energy out to the crowd.
Ja'Bowen knows audiences love it when he dances fast, but his preference is to sit back in the pocket, to swing. His internal focus -- the way he listens and reacts in this unprotected space of strangers -- is a vulnerable display of deep body-mind awareness. And while his musical sensitivity starts at his feet, it doesn't end there. He dances with his entire self. He likes to play with the levels and emotions in music.
Ja'Bowen hails from a tap family in Chicago, where his older brother and a friend started the collective company M.A.D.D. Rhythms in part to give Ja'Bowen, then a teenager, something to do. Ja'Bowen joined the percussive-forward group with no formal training. Once he became proficient enough, he started performing in the streets.
"That's what really developed my talent more than anything else," Ja'Bowen said. "You build the skill in rehearsals, but performing is a different thing."
If a train is a minute or so away and he's done with his number, he'll pick up his mic and invite kids on the platform -- they watch him in awe -- to learn a step. "I'm inviting the kids up, and I'm wishing everybody a good day and that's intentional," he said. "You know, more than tap dancing, I'm working to bring some good energy to the city, to the moment where I am."
That idea is proven again and again. "Hey, tap dancer!" a woman cried out from the opposite side of the platform one day. She wanted to know where to find him on Instagram.
Where does his inspiration come from? Ja'Bowen, also an actor and musician, draws a lot from Jimmy Slyde for the way he used tap as a way to connect with an audience, as well as Sammy Davis Jr. and Gregory Hines. "It's not just their footwork but their presentation," he said, "the way they talk to an audience when they're onstage, the way they stand still."
Tap, he added, is like music. "The notes that you're not playing also have just as much importance as the notes you do play."
In the subway, there is no fourth wall to break. Commuters talk to Ja'Bowen about their day. They ask for directions. They tell him how much his performance moved them. Men have cried. "I think it's because I'm being so open and vulnerable with the way that I'm presenting my art," he said. "Little interactions really mean a lot because I feel like those are the things that make you know your art is really art. It's touching people."

United Airlines and Red Tape: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A couple had to cancel a South America trip for which they'd bought refundable tickets. The airline wouldn't cough up the cash, and they felt like they'd hit the brick wall of bureaucracy -- until our columnist stepped in.
Dear Tripped Up,
On June 3, 2022, my husband and I booked one-way tickets from San Diego to Buenos Aires, which cost $ 8,370, and a separate reservation returning a few weeks later from Santiago, Chile, for $ 4,500 for me, plus miles for my husband's ticket, all on United. Because of health issues, we intended to book refundable tickets. But we noticed right away from the email confirmations that the flights down were nonrefundable -- perhaps our mistake. I called United immediately, and an agent changed those tickets to refundable for a $ 300 fee. So far, so good. When we did eventually cancel the trip, the $ 8,370 was "refunded" as electronic travel certificates, which makes no sense. We paid with a credit card! Two follow-up appeals have been denied. Can you help? Ellen, La Jolla, Calif.
Dear Ellen,
The roadblock that separates you from your money is such a straightforward example of red tape that readers far and wide may want to gather their children 'round the screen or newspaper to hear a tale of just what grown-ups mean when they complain of "bureaucracy."
When airlines offer refunds, they are generally returned in the customer's "original form of payment." Paid with miles? Those miles are restored to your account. Paid by card? That charge is reversed. Presumably, if you chartered a jet with gold bullion, a Brink's truck would soon show up at your home.
And if you paid with an electronic travel certificate, or E.T.C., you get that certificate back to use for future travel. But wait, you paid with a credit card, right? Sort of. When you called United to switch to a refundable ticket, the agent first granted you an E.T.C. for your mistakenly booked tickets, then used that certificate to purchase your refundable tickets. So the technical "original form of payment" was an E.T.C., even if the original original form of payment was a credit card.
Though they twice refused to help you, when I contacted United, they quickly admitted the misstep. "This sort of complicated, somewhat Byzantine situation is very rare," Charlie Hobart, a United spokesman, told me over the phone. He said he had to ask Erin Jankowski, a spokeswoman who also joined the call, to use her experience in customer service to explain the intricacies of what had gone wrong.
The airline has now refunded you $ 8,370, the right way. "This was a misstep on our part, and it was done with good intentions, to expedite the process and ensure the customer had that refundable ticket," Mr. Hobart said.
But United should have corrected the issue upon your request, long before you wrote to me.
You told me that you are a retired attorney, but I pretty much already knew that from the crystal-clear, exasperation-free, 20-page, 10-exhibit PDF you sent me via email. The original documentation you submitted via United's online refunds form, was polite, complete and convincing. (United's policy is not to handle issues after a flight has occurred over the phone.) But it appears no one read it, at least not carefully.
A follow-up email you sent didn't fare much better. United suggested you "direct any further questions to the financial institution that issued the card," which you dutifully did, predictably to no avail.
This is not an issue unique to United. How does a big company enable customer service agents to deal with massive numbers of complaints but still read them carefully enough to pluck out the ones in which a complex chain of events clearly favors the customer? I'm glad it's not my job to make that happen.
My typical advice in situations like this is to complain rationally, respectfully and concisely through one customer service channel (say, calling or an online form), then another (email), then another (social media), hoping that eventually someone with the time and training to step in sees your point. Ms. Jankowski, the United spokeswoman, had a more specific suggestion. "In this case I do think our social care team -- which can be found on Twitter and Facebook 24-7 -- would have been really helpful in this situation," she said. "They have the expertise and means to escalate this to a refund specialist."
Mr. Hobart added that customers should not have to go through all this. "The customer went through the right avenues to get this addressed," he said. "Our goal is to address it early, to address it on the first attempt, and to address it correctly."
When I pressed United on what, concretely, could be done to be sure similar situations -- or different but equally Byzantine one -- were avoided in the future, he said that executives in the "customer leadership group" had been informed and were "keenly interested in this particular scenario."
"We're going to look at this and learn from it, use it as a way to avoid something similar in the future," he said.
Perhaps. But let's end by looking at what you, Ellen, did right here -- and then compare it to something I recently did wrong in my own travels. Realizing potential and unpredictable health issues might disrupt your plans, you elected to book refundable tickets, something many cheaper, less thoughtful fliers (i.e., me) often stubbornly refuse to pay extra for. Then, you carefully read the email confirmation you got (something I'm also guilty of not doing), immediately noticed an issue and called within 24 hours, when airlines are required to refund or rebook you, to correct it. In this case, the airline still erred in how it dealt with your refund, but you ultimately prevailed.
Earlier this week, I found a very cheap one-way flight from New York to São Paulo, Brazil, via Mexico City on Aeromexico ( $ 407!), and booked it, ignoring repeated offers from the airline to make the reservation changeable with a penalty, changeable without a penalty or even refundable for a bit more money. I declined, but the next day realized traveling on a different date would be better for me. It was just under 24 hours since my email confirmation had arrived, so I called Aeromexico to reschedule.
The hold time was long enough to put me over the 24-hour limit, so I braced myself for a fight. But when I finally got on with customer service, the agent politely shut me down before I could even go there: Though I had called within 24 hours of the email confirmation, the actual booking had occurred a half-hour earlier, so I was totally out of luck.
I considered huffing and puffing and pleading and blaming them for not sending the confirmation immediately, but I realized I was doubly at fault -- first for booking a no-changes, no-refund ticket, and then failing to keep track of exactly what time I had made the reservation. I said thank you and hung up. We all need to pick our battles.

A Pacifist Sect From Russia Is Shaken by War, and Modernity

CASTLEGAR, British Columbia — When he was growing up among the Doukhobors, a pacifist religious group that immigrated to Canada from czarist Russia, J.J. Verigin would sometimes arrive home from school to find naked elderly women trying to burn down his family’s house.
One attempt, in 1969, succeeded, lamented Verigin, 67, who recently recounted the episode. A blaze destroyed precious family artifacts, including correspondence between his great-great-grandfather, a prominent Doukhobor leader, and Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, an early admirer of the Doukhobors’ pacifism and Christian morality.
The elderly women, Verigin explained, were part of a small and radical splinter group within the Doukhobors who periodically stripped naked and lit buildings on fire to protest land ownership and what they viewed as excessive materialism. Some among those charged with arson had another motive, he said: getting deported to Mother Russia.
These days, with the Ukraine war raging, most Doukhobors no longer aspire to return to Russia, said Verigin, who leads the largest Doukhobor organization in Canada, and studied in Moscow in 1979. The fires, which for years grabbed headlines in Canada, and polarized the Doukhobors, are also a thing of the past, he stressed.
“Pacifism is at the core of what it means to be a Doukhobor, and the war in Ukraine has ended any residual desire that remained to return to Russia,” said Verigin, the executive director of the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ. “We feel the emotions of our Ukrainian brothers and sisters because we, too, have faced repression in Russia.”
In the 18th century, the Doukhobors (the name comes from a Russian phrase meaning “spirit wrestlers”) rejected the icon worship of the Russian Orthodox Church. They also resisted serving in the imperial military; in 1895, thousands of Doukhobor soldiers set fire to their weapons, which led to the group’s violent suppression and exile.
Tolstoy devoted royalties from his novel “Resurrection” to help finance the Doukhobors’ transit to Canada, and in 1899, more than 7,500 immigrated to what became Saskatchewan to help farm the Canadian prairies. In 1908, the majority resettled in the rural mountainous region in southern British Columbia, in sleepy farming and mill towns like Castlegar and Grand Forks.
An estimated 30,000 people of Doukhobor descent reside in Canada, and for decades they lived ascetic, communal lives reminiscent of the Quakers or Mennonites, though suffused with Russian culture and traditions. Historically, many were vegetarian and shunned alcohol. Their motto: “Toil and peaceful life.”
Many Doukhobors in Canada still speak Russian among themselves; send their children to Russian-language schools; sing Russian hymns at weekly spiritual meetings; bathe in Russian-style steam baths; and eat traditional dishes like borscht.
But the Doukhobor way of life has been buffeted by intermarriage, the allure of city life and a younger generation drawn more to TikTok than Tolstoy. Today, Doukhobors are doctors, professors, lawyers, professional athletes and, in at least one case, a drag queen.
“Assimilation is a challenge to our way of life,” Verigin said.
At a recent choir practice at a Doukhobor cultural center, Jasmine Popoff, 34, a nurse with purple hair, led her choir in a rousing version of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” — in Russian — followed by a spirited rendition in English of Queen’s “Somebody to Love.”
“As Doukhobors, it’s important that our culture evolves so that we keep it going,” Popoff said.
As the discussion turned to the war during a rehearsal break, choir members of all ages said they rejected the authoritarianism and militarism of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. “I don’t feel any connection to Mother Russia because Russia isn’t our mother,” said one singer, Kelly Poznikoff.
Verigin said that, because of anger over the Ukraine conflict, several Doukhobors in recent months had been denied service in local shops in Castlegar.
In the past, prejudice against the Doukhobors in Canada has been fanned by the extremist splinter group, the Sons of Freedom, which in the 1920s began marching in nude protests and torching public buildings and homes. Members of the group opposed property ownership and public schooling for their children. In the 1950s, dozens of their children were forcibly sent to government boarding schools.
Among the last of the radicals was Mary Braun, who in 2001, at age 81, was sentenced to six years in prison after setting fire to a community college building in British Columbia. Before her sentencing Braun disrobed in court. She had previously gone on numerous fasts and lit small fires in courtrooms.
Nadja Kolesnikoff, a yoga instructor who grew up in a Sons of Freedom household, said she had been confused at age 5 when her paternal grandmother burned down her own house and was jailed for three years.
“We were supposed to be pulling together as a community,” she said. “I never asked her why she did it.”
But Kolesnikoff said her upbringing was also empowering. Her family used kerosene lamps and stored vegetables and fruits underground in winter. Luxuries were frowned upon.
“I learned to be self-sufficient, and to this day I feel there is nothing I can’t do,” she said by phone from Costa Rica, where she now lives.
At the Doukhobor Discovery Center in Castlegar, the museum director, Ryan Dutchak, said that some Doukhobors over the past decades had changed their Russian-sounding last names for fear of being ostracized. In Canada’s 2021 census, only 1,675 people identified as Doukhobors.
“Being stigmatized has pushed some people away,” he said.
Elders say preserving the Russian language holds the key to the group’s survival.
On a recent Thursday, dozens of Doukhobors gathered for a spiritual meeting. Wearing colorful kerchiefs, blouses, skirts and aprons, the women sat on one side across from the men. On a table lay a loaf of bread, salt and a pitcher of water, traditional symbols of Doukhobor hospitality.
“Gospodi blagoslovi” — Lord grant us your blessing — they said before singing the Lord’s Prayer in melodious Russian.
Standing at the front of his classroom at an elementary school in Castlegar, Ernie Verigin, a Russian teacher, acknowledged the challenges in preserving the Doukhobor faith. “The younger generation wants a quick fix, but spirituality is a lifelong process,” he said. “It’s hard to compete when my 14-year-old daughter is on Instagram and Facebook.”
The competing pulls of Canadian, Russian and Doukhobor identity can be complicated.
AJ Roberts, 21, a video game designer in Vancouver who grew up in Castlegar, regretted that his Russian was rusty. But he is learning to make his own borscht, even if his mother brings him many jars on every visit.
“I am proud to be Canadian but I don’t shy away from saying I am Doukhobor,” he said. “Because of the war, I am more ashamed of saying I have a Russian background.”

Full text: Bees, seeds, metal and stone all made appearances for the event that makes the city a design hub.
NYCxDesign, a design festival held each May in New York City, wrapped up its 11th edition last week with a strong array of group shows across boroughs -- in Soho showrooms, artist studios and backyards in Brooklyn, vacant office spaces in Chinatown and galleries in between.
Though officially billed as a weeklong festival beginning May 19 and anchored by the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) and WantedDesign at the Javits Center, the event circuit seemed to begin in earnest a week before, with a packed roster of adjacent art and design fairs in town -- including The European Fine Art Foundation (TEFAF), Frieze New York and the New Art Dealers Alliance (NADA). Below are a few highlights from this year's edition.
Heavy Metals
Though modern steel furniture and lighting have been around at least since the Machine Age, sleek chrome finishes, polished stainless steel and brushed aluminum surfaces were especially popular across both categories this year.
Jialun Xiong, a rising talent, presented Default, her debut showing at WantedDesign, in a monochrome palette of silvers and grays meant to evoke "walking into a render of a 3-D modeling program," she said. A few stalls down, Simon Johns shared aluminum tables from his foreboding Future Fossils series, which imagines today's designs as future artifacts excavated from stone.
At Sight Unseen's pop-up show at the Voltz Clarke gallery, Kouros Maghsoudi's cylindrical Neo-Lounge seat, made from hand-welded aluminum, nodded to the space age. So did Luft Tanaka's new Tenfold pendant sconces, which were part of a group show he staged in the backyard of the restaurant Chino Grande. The independent, women-run studio Egg Collective released a set of polished stainless steel side tables with wavy silhouettes and small illustrative inlays of snakes and eyes. And the month's most Instagrammed pop-up restaurant, We Are Ona, designed by Crosby Studios, featured confetti-covered floors and a silvery, photogenic table service tailor-made for the metaverse.
Improvisation
If necessity is one mother of invention, constraint is another. "Make-Do," a pop-up exhibition in Chinatown organized by the auction house Catalog Sale and the Los Angeles gallery Marta, offered a tongue-in-cheek paean to improvisation and instinct.
Avi Kovacevich, a "picker" for vintage galleries and a co-founder of Catalog Sale, showed 12 idiosyncratic chairs from his collection -- objects made from carpet, car tires and wheelbarrow parts -- alongside new commissions from a dozen New York designers, including Minjae Kim and Nifemi Ogunro, who were tasked with creating a new chair in three days.
"The spirit of 'just try it' is the most important aspect of this," Mr. Kovacevich said. "The final product is the sketch and the prototype and the adjustments, all at once."
Raw Materials
Several design galleries presented solo exhibitions that emphasized the heft and beauty of stone and concrete. In Chelsea, the Friedman Benda gallery presented "Coarse" by Samuel Ross, a British product and fashion designer and founder of the label A-COLD-WALL*, who cut his teeth working for Virgil Abloh. For his new works, Mr. Ross glazed and embalmed stone surfaces with turmeric and honey in a ritual gesture and joined them with contrasting accents of industrial materials colored in bright neon hues.
At Carpenters Workshop Gallery, Wonmin Park, a South Korean designer, presented a new collection that joined precise planes of steel with raw, sculpted hunks of stone. And a highlight at Rafael Prieto's debut solo show, "Together Over Time," at Emma Scully Gallery, was a lighting sculpture that joined a lantern and a stone with knotted rope. At a Soho pop-up, Arielle Assouline-Lichten showed her growing body of furniture and lighting made from found pieces of stone slabs, highlighting irregularities and surprising translucent qualities.
Real or Knockoff?
Where do you draw the line between an original and a fake?
At the design co-op and gallery Colony, on Canal Street, the founder, Jean Lin, turned the industry bugbear of counterfeits on its head by instructing members to find inspiration from existing designs for "The Knockoff Show." In a visual game of telephone, Bec Brittain lifted a few details from Lindsey Adelman, a fellow lighting designer and former employer. ("A sanctioned copy," Ms. Lin joked.) The most Instagram-famous piece of the group, by Ben Erickson, presented a replica of the tubular 1984 Ekstrem chair, cheekily remade with sewer pipe parts finished in chrome-mirror enamel.
Dealing with knockoffs is a tough reality for every designer, Ms. Lin said. But turning a point of frustration into one of creativity "can change the narrative a bit and also talk about the fact that nothing exists in a vacuum."
Community Service
At the 3.1 Phillip Lim flagship showroom, Andrea Hill, owner of Tortuga Forma, and Lora Appleton, founder of Kinder Modern and the Female Design Council, teamed with the Asian American Pacific Islander Design Alliance to present "Upon Further Reflection," an exhibition featuring works by 20 female-identifying Asian designers and artists based in the U.S.
"All of us within the community have been rethinking our personal journeys to becoming who we are," said Ms. Hill, who is first-generation Chinese American. She described that journey as "painful, fascinating, important work." Standout works -- including by the ceramist Jane Yang-D'Haene, the textile artist Windy Chien and the design studio Soft-Geometry -- turned that act of self-reflection into a joyful celebration of diverse perspectives and talents.
It's Crafty
Some of the most memorable handcrafted works also had a story to tell.
For her new series of coral-inspired glassware with La Romaine Editions, Sophie Lou Jacobsen, a French American designer, employed the rustic "bullicante" method, which creates bubbles in the glass for a watery effect. And at the Future Perfect showroom in the West Village, Chris Wolston, a Colombia-based artist, drew upon the beauty and symbolism of local plant life with "Flower Power," a new set of terra cotta chairs and lamps accented with little bronze ants, bees and other critters. At Sight Unseen, the South Korean designer Sohyun Yun's Tone side tables featured translucent acrylic panels hand-dyed in a palette inspired by traditional hanbok fabrics.
The itinerant Loewe Foundation Craft Prize exhibition, hosted this year by the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City, featured stunning, one-of-a-kind work by 30 finalists, including Liam Lee and this year's winner, Eriko Inazaki.
Sharing Is Caring
Bee habitats, rain water collectors, a seed library and a community fridge were among the 35 projects featured in the thoughtful exhibition "Public Access," curated by Jean Lee, a designer, at the Head Hi bookshop and the Naval Cemetery Landscape, an oasis of public green space in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Ms. Lee, who put out a global open call for public installations that provoke an act of sharing, said she began planning the show during the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when she felt "the need to connect, but also care for one another." A manifesto for the show espoused values including "authorship over ownership," "diversity over homogenization" and "sharing over commoditizing." In a welcome counterpoint to the private luxuries shaping much of the week, nothing was for sale -- all of the featured designs are open-source and available online.

Full text: Sarah Kaufman writes, acts, sings and makes podcasts and TikToks -- and not to mention works a day job.
This month, Sarah Kaufman will play the witch in the musical "Into the Woods" at the A.R.T./New York Mezzanine Theater in Midtown Manhattan.
It's a dream come true for the performer, who identifies as nonbinary and uses the honorific Mx. EPIC Players, a nonprofit theater company based in Brooklyn that features neurodiverse actors, is producing the musical, which is running June 8-18. "This is one of those shows I listened to on repeat since I was in middle school," Mx. Kaufman said.
Three years ago, the theater artist and writer was diagnosed with autism. "Before getting diagnosed and getting the correct help, I was unaware of the ways my environment was affecting me," Mx. Kaufman said. "I didn't know what my body and brain needed in order to be successful."
If success is measured in creative fulfillment, it has arrived for Mx. Kaufman, who, along with Shane Dittmar, the musical director for "Into the Woods," started a nonbinary writing team called They & Them, as well as a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired fantasy musical podcast, "The Reality Shaper."
Mx. Kaufman, 25, who has a day job at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, lives with Kai Bonacorso, 32, an educator at the New York Aquarium, on the second floor of a prewar building in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, next to the Q train. "You can hear it going by every six minutes," Mx. Kaufman said. "But I don't mind anymore. It's kind of like the ocean."
START WITH A SONG When I'm sleeping, I wear a face mask that blocks out light and ear plugs because I'm sensory sensitive. My iPhone's alarm is set to a sound that came with the phone and goes off at 7 a.m. My backup alarm goes off 20 minutes later -- I set those songs. Before it was "Waving Through a Window" from "Dear Evan Hansen." I recently changed it to "Non-Stop" from "Hamilton."
UP AND OUT I get dressed in my uniform -- a blue button-down shirt, because that's the 9/11 Memorial Museum color, which is inspired by the sky, and black pants -- and grab a lunch that Kai has packed. Usually it's an Amy's frozen meal, like cheese ravioli or the enchiladas, a banana or an apple sauce, and something from IT'SUGAR, a store in Coney Island, which we both love. They sell a snack crate filled with Japanese crackers, chips and cookies. I'm out the door when the second alarm goes off at 7:20 a.m.
CORPORATE EGG SANDWICH I get on the uptown Q or B train at Prospect Park and take that to DeKalb Avenue, where I transfer to the R. While I'm waiting, I'll pull out my phone and order breakfast from Starbucks. There are sadly no mom-and-pop stores in Lower Manhattan. It's just big corporations, so options are limited. When I get out at Cortland Street, my breakfast -- a sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin, and a small, iced Chai latte with light ice -- is ready. I walk through the Oculus and emerge at the museum.
NEW YORK PROUD I visited the museum in 2015 and remember thinking it was incredible. It could have been sad, but they managed to make it uplifting. A few years later, I saw a job posting on Indeed that they were hiring for visitor services. I love working here. It makes you proud to be a New Yorker. In September of 2021, I was the first membership assistant hired back after the Covid lockdown was relaxed, right before the 20th anniversary. Since then, I've raised over $ 70,000 for the museum.
RECHARGE During the week, I spend my day greeting people. Sundays, I'm at the membership desk. I take lunch at 2 p.m. It's not eventful. I microwave my lunch, then sit in one of the break rooms with my noise-canceling headphones and watch something on my iPhone. Right now, it's "Rise of the Pink Ladies." I'm not a big chit-chatter on my break. This is time I need to socially recharge.
DESK JOB I'm back at the desk by 3 p.m. Afternoons are slower. I answer the phones and emails. A lot of people get membership by mistake.
SAFE PLACE Usually I go to rehearsal at the A.R.T./NY South Oxford Space, a service organization for theater nonprofits, where EPIC has offices and rehearsal rooms. I usually meet Shane, who is blind, along with Chevelle, Shane's guide dog, accidentally on the street. Then we'll walk the five blocks together. We started rehearsing in February. As an autistic person who has worked in many nonaccessible spaces, it's great to have a place that feels safe.
RUN THE SHOW We usually go straight to the piano and break into a song, as theater kids do. In the beginning, Shane came in with a huge binder of Braille sheet music. I said, "Wow that's a lot of music," and Shane said, "That's the opening number." It's the most unwieldy thing. At this point, Shane has the entire show memorized. Because we're close to the performance date, we're doing full run-throughs. We start around 6:30 p.m. and go till 9:30 p.m.
FOOLING AROUND One Sunday a month, I drag Kai to Caveat on Clinton Street, where my friend Emily hosts Fantasy Tavern night. People come dressed as fun characters to sing drinking songs and eat tavern food with a collection of other queer nerds. If I'm not rehearsing or doing that, Shane comes over to my place to work on new material. We usually end up recording some silly TikToks. Originally, I wanted my pals to see what I've been working on, but the algorithm picked up our music and brought it to musical theater fans. That's opened doors and opportunities.
TV SHOW MUSICAL Kai, who already ate dinner, has waited impatiently for me. I'll have leftovers and recharge while we watch TV. Right now we're watching the second season of "Schmigadoon!" on Apple TV Plus. It's a musical show where they pay homage to classic Broadway tropes. Kai loves it and refuses to watch it without me.
SCROLLING BEFORE SLEEP I'm in my bedroom by 10:30 p.m. or 10:45 p.m. I watch theater or Dungeons & Dragons TikToks or read on my iPhone. The Dramatists Guild has a list of upcoming opportunities for writers, so I try to stay updated on that because Shane and I apply for fellowships and writing opportunities. I'm slow to fall asleep. I have an active imagination. But once I'm asleep, I'm pretty much out.

D.C. Judge Dismisses Privacy Suit Against Meta: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The District of Columbia accused the company of sharing user data in deceptive ways. A Superior Court decision said Meta had made its policies clear.
The News
A Superior Court judge on Thursday dismissed a privacy lawsuit against Meta by the District of Columbia, which had accused the company of deceiving consumers by improperly sharing their data with third parties, including the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
The decision was a rare victory for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as it battles lawsuits filed by the federal government, states, foreign regulators and consumers in privacy, antitrust and consumer protection disputes.
In his opinion, Judge Maurice A. Ross of Superior Court for the District of Columbia said Facebook's policies had clearly disclosed how third parties could obtain data "such that a reasonable consumer could not have been misled" under the district's consumer protection law.
The district's attorney general at the time, Karl Racine, filed the lawsuit in 2018 after revelations that Cambridge Analytica had obtained data on tens of millions of Facebook users -- including those in the District of Columbia -- without their consent. Mr. Racine accused Facebook of violating the district's law.
But Judge Ross said Facebook not only had adequately informed users of how data could be shared with third parties but had provided instructions on how to limit data sharing. He added that Facebook had taken adequate steps to investigate Cambridge Analytica and inform users after press reports about the activity emerged.
"While the district may disagree with Facebook's approach to the situation, there is no legal basis that required Facebook to act differently," Judge Ross said. "Facebook did not materially mislead consumers as to their response to Cambridge Analytica."
A spokesman for the District of Columbia attorney general's office, Gabriel Shoglow-Rubenstein, said in a statement, "We respectfully disagree with the court's decision and are considering all of our options."
Meta declined to comment.
Why It Matters: This was a rare win in a controversy that continues to dog Meta.
Meta faces legal challenges around the world. The company has grappled with scrutiny and criticism for its handling of disinformation, privacy and competition. Partly to shift Meta's narrative, the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has been trying to turn its focus toward the so-called metaverse, which is a virtual reality space, and artificial intelligence.
The dismissal of the District of Columbia lawsuit stands out not only against that backdrop, but also because it is a rare win in one of Meta's most lasting challenges: the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, which exposed how Facebook's user data can leak and spread.
Lawmakers and regulators around the world have criticized Facebook's handling of user data after the Cambridge Analytica issues surfaced. In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $ 5 billion for data privacy abuses related to the scandal. Last December, Meta agreed to a $ 750 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of sharing data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. Last month, a Delaware judge rejected Facebook's bid to dismiss a lawsuit brought by shareholders over Cambridge Analytica's use of data.
Background: Cambridge Analytica revealed Facebook's privacy issues.
In 2010, Facebook began a program called Open Graph, which gave developers access to the social network's data. Thousands of companies and researchers took advantage of the program.
One of the researchers was Aleksandr Kogan, who in 2013 created a quiz app for Facebook users that collected data on users and their connections on Facebook for psychological profiling.
In 2018, news reports revealed that Mr. Kogan had given the Facebook data from as many as 87 million users to Cambridge Analytica, which used the information to build political profiles for voter targeting by campaigns. At the time, Facebook's privacy practices and data use by other parties were not well understood. The Cambridge Analytica revelations showed how far Facebook user data could travel.

Amazon Agrees to Pay $25 Million to Settle Charges It Violated the Online Privacy of Children: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Regulators said the tech giant kept children's Alexa voice recordings "forever," violating a children's privacy law.
Amazon agreed on Wednesday to pay a civil penalty of $ 25 million to settle federal charges that it kept sensitive information collected from children for years, including their precise locations and voice recordings, in violation of a children's online privacy law.
It was the latest legal action in an intensifying regulatory effort to require some of the world's largest tech platforms to better safeguard their younger users.
The case, brought by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, centers on Amazon's handling of the personal details it collected from children who conversed with Alexa, the company's voice-activated virtual assistant.
In a legal complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, regulators said the tech giant had kept young people's Alexa voice recordings indefinitely and used the data for business purposes like training its algorithm to understand children, violating the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
That law, known as COPPA, requires online services aimed at people younger than 13 to obtain parental consent before collecting a child's personal details and to allow parents to have their children's data deleted. But even after parents sought to delete their children's voice recordings, Amazon failed to delete transcripts of the children's conversations with Alexa from all its databases, regulators said.
"Amazon's history of misleading parents, keeping children's recordings indefinitely, and flouting parents' deletion requests violated" the children's online privacy law and "sacrificed privacy for profits," Samuel Levine, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. "COPPA does not allow companies to keep children's data forever for any reason, and certainly not to train their algorithms."
The complaint also charged Amazon with deceiving consumers, including parents, by repeatedly assuring users they could delete data, like their Alexa voice recordings, yet failing to adequately honor users' deletion requests.
Though it agreed to settle the charges, Amazon said it disagreed with the F.T.C.'s claims and denied violating the children's law.
"We built Alexa with strong privacy protections and customer controls," the company said in a statement. The statement added that the company had designed Amazon Kids, a service that enables parents to manage games, books and other content for their children, to comply with the children's online privacy law, and that Amazon had worked with the F.T.C. before expanding the children's content service to include Alexa.
Under the terms of the proposed settlement agreement, Amazon would be required to delete children's voice recordings and precise location data as well as inactive Alexa accounts belonging to children. The proposed agreement also prohibits Amazon from misrepresenting how it handles users' voice recordings, precise location data and children's data.
A federal court must approve the settlement order.
The Amazon case comes at a moment of heightened public concern over how some prominent social networks, video game services and device makers treat their younger users. It highlights intensifying efforts by the Federal Trade Commission to force large tech platforms to bolster protections for sensitive information, like precise location or personal health details, whose disclosure could pose privacy or physical risks to adult consumers and children.
Last December, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, agreed to pay $ 520 million to settle accusations by the F.T.C. that it had illegally harvested data from players under 13 and, separately, steered millions of users to make unwanted payments. In 2019, Google agreed to pay a $ 170 million penalty to settle charges from the F.T.C. and the attorney general of New York that it had violated children's privacy on YouTube.
The intensifying regulatory push to protect children online is not limited to the United States. Last September, Irish regulators announced they would levy a fine of about $ 400 million against Meta for its handling of children's information on Instagram. Meta said it disagreed and planned to appeal.
In a separate case on Wednesday, the F.T.C. accused Ring, the home security camera service, of committing "egregious violations" of users' privacy, saying that privacy and security failures at the company had enabled employees to illegally snoop on customers and allowed hackers to hijack users' accounts.
Regulators said that Ring, which Amazon acquired in 2018, had "unreasonable" data security and privacy practices from at least 2016 through January 2020.
In 2017, for instance, one Ring employee viewed thousands of videos belonging to dozens of female customers, including in sensitive locations like the women's bedrooms and bathrooms, the agency said in a legal complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The proposed settlement order would require Amazon to pay $ 5.8 million in consumer refunds, institute stringent security measures and delete algorithms or other data products derived from the illegal viewing of consumers' videos.
In a statement, Amazon said Ring had addressed the security and privacy issues before the F.T.C. had begun its inquiry.

Full text: I'm traveling in West Africa on my annual win-a-trip journey, a global reporting expedition on which I take a university student to highlight issues that deserve more attention. My winner this year is Maddie Bender, a recent Yale graduate (the pandemic delayed our trip) -- and with that, I'm handing the rest of the column over to her.
By Maddie Bender
FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- When Abdul was a teenager and coming to terms with being gay, he was attacked by a group of men. They mocked him with homophobic slurs and assaulted him with broken beer bottles, slicing his thumb open.
He reported the attack to the police and was told that an arrest could be made -- of him, for homosexuality.
Sierra Leone is one of more than 30 African nations (over half the continent) that criminalize same-sex relations. While most of the gay people I spoke with there did not seem to fear being arrested, they said discrimination against them was widespread in housing, employment and family life.
Meanwhile, American conservative Christian groups with records of fighting L.G.B.T.Q. rights have poured millions of dollars into African countries, according to a 2020 report. Some American evangelicals have been known to encourage anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation in countries such as Uganda.
Queer issues are deeply personal to me, since I am bisexual. While L.G.B.T.Q. people still suffer danger and discrimination in America, traveling with Nick in West Africa offered a window into the immense adversity queer people experience here -- and their resilience and courage in the face of it.
But Africa is not uniformly homophobic, and I found some physical and virtual space emerging for L.G.B.T.Q. communities. In São Tomé and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa, homosexuality has been legal since 2012. "Sexuality is free," the country's prime minister, Patrice Trovoada, told me, adding that in his country, "you don't have this hate attitude" toward gay people.
Still, it's complicated. Members of an association for gay men in São Tomé say L.G.B.T.Q. people in the country have experienced violence and been ostracized from their families. The group's president, Kelve Borros, 28, told me, "Nothing about life is easy."
In Sierra Leone, I met two dozen queer people inside a community center run by the Dignity Association, a local advocacy group. The center's warmth reminded me of a support group I belonged to in high school, where I had my first kiss with a girl.
Outside, the atmosphere is chillier. Although people were happy to talk about homosexuality when I asked, most said they'd never encountered a gay person. But in 2013, the Sierra Leonean government estimated that around 20,000 (and possibly more) men who have sex with men live in the country. Statistics for queer women are fuzzier.
Spending time online may be broadening some people's worldviews. A 2020 review of Africans' attitudes toward homosexuality suggests that frequent internet users are more likely to be tolerant of gay people.
Two teenagers in the city of Makeni in northern Sierra Leone, Fatmata Binta Jalloh, 17, and Marie Kamara, 16, told me that while they believe homosexuality doesn't exist in their country, they've seen plenty of gay people online. They recalled watching a viral TikTok video of a lesbian couple celebrating after conceiving a child through in vitro fertilization. The video, they said, made them happy for this couple, whose sexuality they had been taught to fear.
For L.G.B.T.Q. youths like Abdul, online content can be a kind of lifeline. He follows queer celebrities on Instagram, including the musician Sam Smith and the rapper Rashad Spain (known as Saucy Santana), and aspires to a level of success that could partly insulate him from violence and homophobia.
When asked about the queer representation that Sierra Leone's young people may see online, the country's president, Julius Maada Bio, compared external influences to the contagion of gun violence. Because of technology, he said, "copycatting becomes very easy," and he worried that outside information "poses a serious threat to our own culture and way of life."
I'd like to see the United States use its influence to press for more tolerance -- certain forms of aid, for example, could require participating organizations not to discriminate against L.G.B.T.Q. people -- but after talking to people like Fatmata and Marie, I suspect that our greatest tool for making change is soft power.
We should be outraged by how far the Christian right has gone to support the persecution of gay people in African countries. These laws need to change, but I doubt that equal and opposite meddling is the solution.
Instead, we can call on our own leaders to help fund safe spaces abroad and strengthen lines of communication with local organizations in Africa like the Dignity Association, and speak out when their members are threatened.
As for those of us in the L.G.B.T.Q. community, let's embrace our power online. In the face of bigotry and restrictive legislation at home and abroad, flaunting our pride can be an act of radical resistance. And all of us can speak with our wallets, making clear that tourism will be jeopardized in countries that punish same-sex love.
Attitudes aren't shifting fast enough for young people like Abdul, who was outed in 2019 and driven from his home. Now 20, he imagines a different life for himself because of the queer celebrities he follows online.
They've taught him that he has to strive, he said, adding, "I know it's not going to be easy."

Full text: Looking for nonalcoholic drinks beyond seltzer? You're in luck.
Unofficial summer is officially underway. I'm looking forward to eating outdoors as much as humanly possible before it gets unbearably hot. (I'm a summer agnostic.) That said, it's reader question time and, as usual, my inbox was full of thoughtful and fun requests, including where to go for large-format dining, where to find carciofi alla giudia (Jewish-style artichokes) and where to have great nonalcoholic drinks.
As always, please email your questions to wheretoeat@nytimes.com, and you may see them answered in a future newsletter.
Duck, Pig or Sea Bass?
One of our favorite things to do with friends is to go out to eat where fixed-menu, family-style dining is offered. We recently ate at Momofuku Ssam Bar for the pork shoulder dinner. Can you recommend some other restaurants that offer this type of experience? -- Joy W.
Francie, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has a whole roast duck for $ 135 that's presented with various flora before it's carved up. It's definitely worth ordering if you can afford it, especially for the soppressata jam that, I agree with Pete Wells, is good enough to lick off "a stack of junk mail." Peasant, in NoLIta, will serve you a family-style whole pig roast with antipasti, sides and dessert for $ 125 per person, given at least four days' notice and provided there are six or more people in your party. And Monsieur Vo, in the East Village, has a few big-format dishes, including a whole sea bass that's market-price, and the Monsieur Platter ( $ 48), which includes four types of meat skewers with the option to add more, as well as sides like vermicelli and roasted peanuts that you then assemble into your own bites. We call that fun with food.
Finding Carciofi alla Giudia
Just spent a week in Rome where I fell in love with Roman artichokes, Jewish-style. Ate them several times that week. Where can I find them in N.Y.C.? -- Lisa S.
I ate this exact type of deep-fried artichoke spritzed with lemon juice and dressed with mint and red chile flakes at Bottino, in Chelsea, a few weeks ago. The occasion? My sister's wedding! Talk about kismet. They're also on the menu at Macosa Trattoria, a small-but-mighty Italian restaurant in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that I mentioned a few months ago.
Not-Boring Nonalcoholic Beverages
As I have recently had to stop drinking alcohol for health reasons, I was hoping you can send me to the restaurants with the most creative nonalcoholic beverage programs. I can drink only so much sparkling water! -- Ira L.
I wasn't quite sure if you were looking for nonalcoholic drinks that were mimicking cocktails, or just very creative nonalcoholic drinks. So, I have recommendations for both. I see the phony Negroni from the Brooklyn distiller St. Agrestis on a ton of menus and, as a Negroni obsessive, I endorse it as an alterative. El Quijote has a version of the restaurant's famous sangria that's cheekily called Santa Sangre, as well as a G + T without the G. And the eternally excellent Gramercy Tavern has nonalcoholic red wine and a nonalcoholic cocktail list that's four options deep, including two seasonal spritzes (strawberry-rhubarb and green apple-fennel at the moment).
In the category of creative drinks, there's abcV, Jean-Georges's health-leaning restaurant in the Flatiron district. Between bites of your mushroom-walnut Bolognese, you can sip on any number of "juices, tonics and vibrations." I'd choose Root Reboot because lemon and ginger are my life, though a pollen shake might be the best way to toast the dustiest spring ever. Or if you'd really prefer to have some pork al pastor, Atla, in NoHo, has six agua frescas that range from the traditional hibiscus to a more experimental yuzu avocado.
In Other News ...
The dream of top-tier Peking duck is alive and well at Juqi, the Beijing-based chain with a new location in Flushing, Queens. In his review, Pete Wells writes that the restaurant pulls off "all the fine points of roasting, carving and serving -- so consistently and satisfyingly."
Openings: The Migrant Kitchen, known for its eclectic mix of cuisines, will start serving lamb torta and esquites hot dogs at Ballfields Café in Central Park; the Golden Swan has taken over the space that once housed the Spotted Pig, in the West Village; and Hand Hospitality is back at it again with Moono, a more casual project from the chef behind the Michelin-starred restaurant Jua.
Kim Severson delivered a deep dive on what restaurant hospitality looks like after the pandemic and labor shortages devastated the industry.
Should you find yourself in southern New Mexico any time soon, consider stopping by Chope's Town Bar & Cafe, the family-run restaurant with a beloved (and closely guarded) recipe for chile con queso, Maggie Hennessy reports.
Here is how Zouheir Louhaichy, the head maître d' at Balthazar, spends his Sundays.
Nicholas Gray, the founder of the popular hot-dog stand Gray's Papaya, died May 19 at the age of 86.

Flight Attendant Shares Her 12 Etiquette Rules For Summer Traveling: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Air travel is going to be busy this summer. With some common sense and courtesy, could flying be ... pleasant?
After 21 years as a flight attendant, I've seen it all. The pandemic heightened tensions on board, with the most extreme incidents of bad passenger behavior escalating to violence. More commonly, though, I see discourteous behavior lead to verbal disagreements, or a general unpleasantness.
As we enter the busy summer season, it's worth discussing some of the common courtesies that could make flying, dare I say, pleasant.
Here are my airline etiquette rules, which aim to strike a balance between your own reasonable comforts and thoughtfulness to those around you.
Everyone has the right to recline -- but there's a polite way to do it.
The wrong way is slamming back the seat as hard and fast as you can. That has broken laptops, spilled drinks and caused fistfights that have caused flights to be diverted. Be aware of your surroundings. Before reclining, peek behind you and see what the situation is, and nicely ask if that person minds.
Clean up after your kids.
We are not maids. Flight attendants do not have access to vacuums, brooms or cleaning supplies that go beyond hand soap, wet wipes and air freshener. You are not required to clean up, but it's courteous. There are knock-on effects, too: Messes in the aisle can be a safety hazard, and a big cleaning job can even delay the next flight. Proactive thinking helps. Can a small child handle a large bag of snacks? If not, put them in a smaller, more manageable container ahead of time.
The overhead bins aren't your personal Tetris game.
The bins are first-come, first-serve in economy class. You don't own the spot directly above your seat, and it's not acceptable to take out someone else's bag to make yours fit. Sliding bags to maximize space is fine, but save the complex puzzle solving for the flight attendant. And remember, small bags belong at your feet, keeping room for large bags in the overhead bins.
No one wants to hear your FaceTime conversation.
We don't need to hear both sides of that conversation; plus, boarding an airplane is not the time for your goodbyes. It's time for you to concentrate on finding your seat and stowing your bags as fast as possible so the people behind you can do the same thing. While we are on the topic, no one wants to hear your movies, video games or TikToks, so bring headphones. Even for children.
The middle seat gets both armrests.
It's the consolation prize for being squished between two people with nowhere to lean. Case closed.
Headphones are a perfectly acceptable conversation ender.
Overly chatty seatmate? Headphones are a great way to keep from being the sounding board for your neighbor who can't take a hint. It's my go-to move: After a long day of being a flight attendant, my noise-canceling headphones are my haven. I want peace on my commute home.
Keep your socks on.
If it's a long flight, by all means relax and take off your shoes, but there is never a reason to take off your socks. Foot smell is inescapable. Also, keep your feet to yourself. It is not acceptable to rest your feet on the armrest of the person in front. And I highly recommend putting your footwear back on to use the lavatory.
Use the call button wisely.
If you need something -- a coffee refill, assistance with a medical issue or help with a disruptive passenger -- please use it. It is preferable to poking or tapping the flight attendant, which is not OK. Before you press it, though, make sure we aren't already in the aisle with a beverage cart or a trash bag -- that means we're already coming! If you are having a true emergency, please hit it several times so we know it's important.
Don't discipline other people's kids.
Nothing makes a flight more miserable than the back of your seat becoming a punching bag. However, if a child behind you is being disruptive, address the parents. You don't have the right to yell at someone else's child. A nice way to approach this is to ask the parents calmly, and with a smile, if they realize their child is kicking your seat. Then say it's bothersome; is there any way you can you make the child stop? This way you are not accusing in your tone, and are asking instead of being bossy.
Deal with your seating issues before you get on the plane.
If your family is split up on the flight, the chaotic rush of boarding is not when flight attendants can solve it for you. The gate agents have access to the seating chart and family reservations, so please ask them first if it is possible to change your seats. Some airlines even have a policy that families with children under 13 must sit together, so the gate agent is the best place. Or even better: Call the airline before coming to the airport.
You don't have to switch seats if someone asks you.
I'm going to be unpopular here. No, you do not have to switch with someone who asks you. If you have paid extra for your seat, or even if it is just an inconvenience, you can kindly say no. If it is advantageous, like trading a middle seat for a window seat, or you are happy to help, please go ahead and swap.
Flush. Please.
This should be common sense, but somehow it isn't. I deal with this all day, every day. I do not want to flush your deposit, and neither does the passenger after you. If you can't find the button, please look for it: I guarantee it's there. On every airplane.

Full text: Vicmar Flores and Cullen Heater met in Panama City in 2017, and over the next couple of years traversed great distances to be with one another.
Vicmar Carolina Flores Hidalgo and Cullen Joseph Heater first crossed paths at a hostel in Panama City in late 2017. Mr. Heater, a Peace Corps volunteer from Milton, Mass., was recuperating there after ankle surgery. Ms. Flores, who moved to Panama from her native Venezuela a year earlier, was teaching yoga at the hostel.
They caught glimpses of each other, but didn't speak until the end of Mr. Heater's monthlong convalescence, when they learned they would both be attending a concert of a mutual friend.
After a night of communal drinking and dancing, they decided to stay in touch, despite the difficulties posed by Mr. Heater's return to his Peace Corps community. He lived in Boca de Cuiria, a remote village without electricity, in the province of Coclé, about six hours and two river crossings away from Panama City.
The two made plans to meet in January 2018, and at a friend's suggestion visited Isla Taboga, in the Gulf of Panama.
"We fell in love with this island," said Ms. Flores, 30. They have returned there every year since that first visit.
Unlike many other tourists who lounged on the popular beaches, Mr. Heater and Ms. Flores opted to explore less-trodden corners of the island, where they discovered what became one of their favorite places: Playa de las Piedras or "stone beach."
"It's all rocks so nobody ever goes there," Mr. Heater said. "But it's beautiful because the tide will come in and you won't be able to see the beach. And then the tide will go out and there's all these beautiful shells and rocks."

For the next year and a half, the couple traversed great distances to be with one another. The long trek between Mr. Heater's Peace Corps community and Panama City was often challenging. They had to rely on multiple buses, sometimes hitch rides in the back of trucks and then hike a couple miles from the road to the village.
"It has been a theme throughout our relationship," said Mr. Heater, 32. "'Go on this adventure with me."'
Ms. Flores, who studied agronomy at the Universidad Central de Venezuela in El Limón, Maracay, is currently a self-employed yoga instructor. Mr. Heater, who has a bachelor's degree in psychology from McGill University in Montreal, works remotely as a writer and editor at the Rainforest Foundation, which supports Indigenous groups in Central and South America.
When his Peace Corps service ended in September 2019, Mr. Heater decided to stay in Panama to be with Ms. Flores. In January 2020, the couple moved to a small apartment in Panama City. An eight-month-long pandemic lockdown followed, during which the couple realized that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.
In August 2021, Mr. Heater proposed on their beloved stone beach on Taboga. They came upon a rare patch of sand amid the rugged shore.
"Hey, look what I found here," Mr. Heater said to Ms. Flores. It was common for them to show each other colorful debris, like an ornate shell or pretty rock, churned up by the ebbing tide. Ms. Flores turned around to find Mr. Heater on one knee with an uncut diamond ring in his hand.
The couple hoped to settle in the Boston area, but the plan came with complications. Ms. Flores had been denied a tourist visa to the United States. The couple then decided to apply for a K-1 fiancée visa, which would allow her to come to the United States and marry Mr. Heater within 90 days. It took two years for the visa to be approved.
"We planned four weddings for four seasons," Ms. Flores said, laughing.
In March, Ms. Flores acquired the visa, and over the next 40 days, they planned their wedding.
The couple were married May 13 in the backyard garden of Mr. Heater's parents' home in Milton, where they are currently living until they find their own place in the Boston area. The wedding was officiated by Lisa Ward, a local Unitarian Universalist minister.
Forty-two guests attended, most of them family members. Ms. Flores' parents were unable to attend, though many of her other close relatives did, including two of her three siblings. The ceremony was livestreamed over Instagram in English and Spanish for friends and family outside the country.
"He truly cares about other people," Ms. Flores said of Mr. Heater. "He truly wants to save the world."
Mr. Heater said he admires the passion Ms. Flores brings to her career and her willingness to uproot her life in pursuit of a new adventure. "She does it with a grace that I could never manage," he said.

Full text: In Montauk, chic rooftop lounges with cover fees and $ 20 cocktails have yet to overtake one marina.
Last spring, Liar's Saloon, one of the last no-frills watering holes left in Montauk, the rapidly developing beach town at the tip of Long Island's East End, looked like it was gone for good. The family-owned business had just closed, its longtime owners ready for a change.
"When it was closed, locals saw it almost as a lost way of life," said Jennifer Fowkes, the executive director of the Montauk Chamber of Commerce.
Residents clucked that another chic lounge or hotel would replace it as the hamlet, with its rustic fishing village roots, continued its whirlwind evolution from casual surfers' hangout to glamorous hot spot. "Every day there was a new rumor," Ms. Fowkes said. "It was everything from, 'They are knocking Liar's down to build luxury condos' to 'The owners of Gurney's are turning it into something exclusive' to 'Liar's isn't actually closing."
That last rumor ended up being true. A local couple, Hali Devlin and Phil Baigent, along with Ms. Devlin's mother, Eileen Devlin, 62, are reopening Liar's just as it was, with nothing more than a fresh coat of paint, some new gravel in the parking lot, and a new name.
"We think people will probably still refer to it as Liar's," Hali Devlin said. "We did for a long time."
There's a reason for that: The 600-square-foot bar, part of a marina on Montauk Harbor, was something of a salty, storied institution.
"It was like the old guard of Montauk type of place," said Brian Lee, 38, a commercial fisherman who now operates out of New Bedford, Mass. "It was where all the fishermen hung out," he said, recalling its dollar drafts and generous mudslides. "We could get a little crazier there than at a normal bar," he continued. "It would be like taking 20 cowboys from the 1800s and putting them in a bar today. We were like wild pirates."
For Hali Devlin, 29, who grew up in Montauk, and Mr. Baigent, 39, a fisherman, taking over Liar's -- and honoring its traditions -- was personal. For one thing, the Devlin family owns Salivar's Clam & Chowder House, a dockside restaurant and another old-school holdout in Montauk. But Liar's is also where Ms. Devlin used to socialize, and where she and Mr. Baigent, who had known each other from around town, met and fell for each other.
"I always put quotes around the word 'met,"' she said laughing. "It was one of those typical not all there kind of nights at Liar's."
The bar is now called Marlena's Pack Out, as the new owners don't have the legal right to the old name. Marlena's is the name of the marina where the bar is, and "pack out" is a fishing term, referring to fishermen unloading their catch.
This week, Marlena's Pack Out got its liquor license. Depending on when its first shipment of alcohol arrives, it could be up and running Memorial Day Weekend. If that happens, customers will be greeted with the same wooden bar and metal stools, and the same photographs -- mostly of local fishermen and patrons holding up their catches -- from the Liar's era. Frozen pizza and mudslides will still be on the menu. Unlike many other bars in Montauk, there will be no cover fee and no " $ 21-dollar cocktails," Ms. Devlin said.
Many of the bartenders will be the same as before. "A lot of the bartenders are really good friends," she said. "We all have a lot of good memories at the old bar, and we are all happy to come back."
Mr. Lee looks forward to returning with some of his fishing buddies. "My family lives in Noyack, so I end up down there a couple of times every summer, and I am definitely going to go get a mudslide," he said. "It felt like home for a bunch of us. I like that it's coming back."
Some of the younger people drawn to Montauk's more flashy and Instagram-friendly venues have mentioned their interest in stopping by to pay their respects.
"I always associated Montauk with Surf Lodge," said Megan Eberly, 26, who works at a public relations company in Manhattan, referring to Montauks' celebrity-clad live music venue, which opened in 2008. But the more she spoke with people who lived out there, she said, the more she learned that Liar's, which had been around for well over twice that long, was more representative of the beach town before its glow-up.
For Ms. Devlin, everyone is welcome, especially the Liar's regulars, she said, adding that she's feeling the pressure of bringing back a place loved by so many.
"Every time we leave the house everyone keeps asking, "When is it opening?"' she said. "I'm like, 'Please stop asking. We are more anxious than you to have it open."

Full text: In his velvet jacket, colorful scarf and longish, graying hair, David Dubal looks as if he might have emerged from a 19th-century daguerreotype album recalling the life and times of a lesser-known romantic poet, a Renaissance man from an era long gone.
Yet his many accomplishments are decidedly modern. A professor emeritus (Juilliard), Peabody award-winning radio broadcaster, TV producer, pianist, painter and, most centrally, authority on piano, Mr. Dubal is a mainstay of New York's classical music scene. In addition to being the author of many published works ("The Art of the Piano," "Evenings With Horowitz") and the host of long-running radio shows ("The Piano Matters" on WWFM and "Reflections From the Keyboard" on WQXR), he won an Emmy for his 1993 documentary, "The Golden Age of the Piano." But he is perhaps most in his element on Tuesday evenings at Grace & St. Paul's Church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
It is there that he holds his weekly course, Piano Evenings With David Dubal, which is filled with a cross-section of piano enthusiasts and aficionados, many of whom have been studying with Mr. Dubal for decades. Top-notch pianists perform, and Mr. Dubal critiques the composer's work. His encyclopedic knowledge is stunning.
But what has galvanized him lately is a new venture: an interactive video game called Piano Galore. It is meant to, in his humble estimation, address the "dearth of arts in America," which he equates with psychic and social annihilation.
"No art? No life!" he proclaimed during a wide-ranging conversation in his spacious, lived-in Upper West Side apartment that is awash in his own nonfigurative paintings and his massive, eclectic book collection, which he estimates contains 5,000 volumes.
"You cannot be an educated humanist unless you read," he asserted. "I read five or six books at a time. I underline passages I like. I make comments in the margins. I quote them on the radio show. I love the smell of the book page. I sniff at it as others sniff cocaine."
The video game is an antidote to what Mr. Dubal views as a crisis embodied in the diminished audience for classical music and the vast cut back in concert venues. It is also a financial opportunity, given the limited opportunities for writers of books on serious music.
"My publisher for my latest piano book loves it but says it will not sell," he said. "Nothing has value in this culture unless it's monetized. I no longer have a publisher or agent but need one."
Asked which of his many roles most defines him, Mr. Dubal responded with some drama: "I never want to define myself." His eyes grew wide. "To define yourself is death. Nietzsche said that." Like a judge pounding a gavel, he slapped his palm onto his coffee table. "I am constantly reinventing myself. Every day."
Mr. Dubal was born around 1944 (he would prefer not to say exactly) and was raised in Cleveland. Like most boys of his generation, he grew up loving baseball. "Every child in that era wanted to be a baseball star," he recalled. But when he was 9 years old, his parents quite casually bought a piano, and it didn't take long for him to trade in his baseball cards for sheet music. He was one of the few who later made it to Juilliard.
He hoped to earn his living as a concert pianist but ultimately came to terms with the fact that it was not realistic. And so following graduation, he taught music in various institutions, including in what was formerly The New York Institute for the Education of the Blind. One day, while sitting in the dentist's chair, he learned about an opening for the job of music director at WNCN, a classical music station.
His face still numb from Novocain, Mr. Dubal called the station and within short order was hired, serving for more than 20 years as its guiding force, reshaping its direction and programming every hour of every day. Today, he said, he is grateful not to be in charge of a station's programming anymore, responsible only for his regular radio shows.
Despite his dire cultural predictions, Mr. Dubal expresses a quirky optimism and a healthy dose of irony. Piano Galore initially envisioned superheroes -- Superman, Wonder Woman, the Green Hornet -- as piano teachers. When a student would make a mistake, for instance, Catwoman might swat the keyboard with her tail. He scrapped that idea because of copyright issues, though he especially regrets the loss of Catwoman.
He is now toying with the idea of creating his own cast of animated superheroes -- pianists, conductors, composers -- who will interact with one another and the players. The mandate is to teach piano and music appreciation.
Mr. Dubal has hired a web designer, Dante Montovano, to help him work out the details. Mr. Montovano's company, Seven Circle Media, collaborated with Mr. Dubal on another project, "The Unconquerable Piano: A Literary Journal of Piano Culture," an online quarterly to be launched in October.
He is determined to accommodate Mr. Dubal's fanciful ambition and its comic improbability, whatever that involves, including the acquisition of a computer for Mr. Dubal, who does not own one. He does have an iPhone, though, and will occasionally text and email on it. Still, he favors pen, paper and cursive script.
Nothing takes greater precedence for him than his love of classical music. "Great classical music is the purest and the most ecstatic art form," Mr. Dubal said. "It touches the Godhead. But nobody wants that. They want stadiums, noise, all the manifold properties of pop culture that have nothing to do with art."
A natural improvisor, Mr. Dubal gained enthusiasm as he spoke. He was fierce, almost unnerving, yet he seemed to be rather enjoying the slightly demented impression he was making.
"We've been conditioned from birth," he continued. "Capitalism and commercialism. Salesmanship. The lying publicity machine, the 21st-century Barnum. The first ugly American. Glory, glory, hallelujah, a monument to nothing. Social media. It's antisocial."
Still, he is aware that his interactive video game would certainly benefit from social media and the possibility of reaching audiences in the millions. In fact, in an effort to broaden his market, he said he has plans to master Instagram, TikTok and all the other "antisocial" media out there. He doesn't exactly know what an influencer is or does, but he aspires to become one to help his brand and promote his game, his vision and himself.
On a cryptic note that both celebrates and slyly derides himself, he summed it up: "In a society in which incompetence rises to the top, mediocrity is an ideal that we may never achieve again," said with a hint of mischief. "I'm a midlevel mediocrity, even as I'm circling around perfection."

A Schooner That's Fit for a Gazillionaire: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon's founder has been spotted on Koru, a massive schooner with a design that evokes the golden age of sailing in the early 20th century.
Just in time for the high season of yachting in the Mediterranean, when multimillion-dollar megayachts descend on ports like Monte Carlo and St. Tropez, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has been photographed with his partner Lauren Sánchez on his new boat, Koru, off the coast of Spain.
Mr. Bezos' vessel is a sailing yacht, a departure from the diesel-powered, floating palaces popular with other billionaires. But it is still massive. At 417 feet, Koru is the world's largest sailing yacht, according to Boat International, and it cost an estimated $ 500 million to build, Bloomberg reported. (Parsifal III, the boat featured on Bravo's reality series "Below Deck Sailing Yacht," is 177 feet long -- less than half the length of Koru -- and cost $ 18 million, according to the website SuperYachtFan.)
A spokesperson for Mr. Bezos did not comment for this article; neither did Oceanco, Koru's builder. Here is what to know about the boat.
The Design
For traditionalists, Koru is refreshing. At a time when yacht design skews outrageous -- see the lizardlike, 262-foot Artefact or the otherworldly 463-foot Yas -- Koru stands out as a schooner, a sailing vessel with two or more masts. Photos reveal a large sailboat with three masts, an on-deck pool and a voluptuous mermaid on the bow, that bears a resemblance to Ms. Sánchez. But otherwise, the sleek, classic lines suggest the patrician age of yachting in the early 20th century, said Robert B. MacKay, author of "The Golden Age of Newport Yachting: Between the Wars."
"With the clipper bow and the dark hull and the masts," Mr. MacKay said, referring to Koru's concave, pointy forward section, "it reminds me of a boat built in 1930 for J.P. Morgan Jr., Corsair IV. It is almost like a reincarnation. It's certainly at odds with the stuff the oligarchs are building -- those look like bloated Clorox bottles."
Compared with the world's very largest motor yachts -- built for sheer size and the accompanying bragging rights -- Koru could almost be considered quaint. Azzam, one of the world's largest motor yachts, is nearly 200 feet longer.
The Experience
Koru will be propelled primarily by the wind. "Sailboats are usually greener than most powerboats," said Don Anderson, a former captain of M5, the world's largest single-masted sailboat, at 256 feet. "I'd like to think that Koru will be one of the most ecological yachts out there, with its sails and also with the technology that will be aboard."
"When you're on a sailboat, you're more in touch with the wind and the waves than on a powerboat," he continued. "You're more susceptible to the elements, too. But you can leave California, and once you get past the Catalinas you can basically surf downwind all the way to Hawaii. All you need to do is run with the waves."
Mr. Bezos has been a guest on similar boats, according to Bloomberg: In 2019, he was spotted on Eos, a 305-foot sailing yacht owned by Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg.
Bill Tripp, a Connecticut-based naval architect, said the appeal of this type of boat is clear: "When you are on a powerboat, you ask, 'Are we there yet?' and on a sailboat, you're enjoying the ride and the ocean so much that you don't ask that question."
The Dinghy
Koru will be trailed by Abeona, a 246-foot support vessel. Superyachts often have support vessels following along behind them. These "shadows," as they are colloquially known, are for the "toys" -- the ATVs, supercars, seaplanes, motorcycles, smaller boats, scuba gear, personal submarines and even helicopters that pleasure boaters might bring on a trip. According to its builder, this model of boat can carry these gadgets along with dozens of crew members. (Ms. Sanchez flies helicopters, and the couple was recently photographed taking a helicopter to board Abeona and then Koru.)
Abeona, a motor yacht, will have enough range to follow Koru from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean -- a common course for yachts -- on a single tank of gas.
The Kerfuffle
Koru set off a controversy last year -- before it was even completed -- in a face-off with the Dutch city of Rotterdam. The boat was built at Oceanco's facility in Alblasserdam, the Netherlands, and needed to pass the historic Koningshaven Bridge, known as "De Hef," in Rotterdam, to undergo testing in the North Sea.
When the city announced it would dismantle the bridge to allow the boat and its mainmast -- an estimated 230 feet tall -- to pass through unscathed, locals were angry. They planned a protest to throw eggs at the yacht as it cruised by. In the end, the bridge was not taken apart, and the yacht was towed to a different location to have its masts attached.
The Name
Koru is Maori for "coil" or "loop" and refers to the unfurling of a fern frond. The koru design is common in traditional Maori art, where it symbolizes new life, growth and peace. Mr. Bezos included a photo of a koru frond in an Instagram post on Jan. 1, 2022.
Brad Stone, who was the first to report on Koru, in his 2021 book "Amazon Unbound: Jeff Bezos and the Invention of a Global Empire," said the name was "consistent with where we see him today."
"He is no longer this single-minded tech guy," Mr. Stone said. "He's in media and Hollywood and has a new relationship."

Full text: Many said her music and her life story were inspirations as she overcame abuse during her marriage to Ike Turner and emerged as a star on her own.
Rock and soul singers, civil rights activists and political leaders mourned Tina Turner on Wednesday as a trailblazing artist whose music and life epitomized resilience, determination, heart and the power to not only survive but thrive over five decades in the music industry.
"Tina would have so much energy during her performances and was a true entertainer," Magic Johnson, the former star of the Los Angeles Lakers, wrote on Twitter. "She created the blueprint for other great entertainers like Janet Jackson and Beyoncé and her legacy will continue on through all high-energy performing artists."
As news spread of Ms. Turner's death, at 83, in Switzerland, many said her life story was an inspiration as she overcame abuse during her marriage to Ike Turner and emerged as a star on her own, with the release of her solo album "Private Dancer" in 1984.
"This woman rose like a Phoenix from the ashes of abuse, a derailed career, and no money to a renaissance like I've never seen in entertainment," Sherrilyn Ifill, the former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said on Twitter. "She became fully herself and showed us all how it's done."
Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, who toured with Ms. Turner in Britain in 1966 and then in the United States in 1969, in a series of concerts that helped introduce her music to white audiences, said that he was "so saddened by the passing of my wonderful friend Tina Turner."
"She was truly an enormously talented performer and singer," Mr. Jagger wrote on Instagram. "She was inspiring, warm, funny and generous. She helped me so much when I was young and I will never forget her."
Former President Barack Obama said on Twitter that "Tina Turner was raw. She was powerful. She was unstoppable. And she was unapologetically herself -- speaking and singing her truth through joy and pain; triumph and tragedy."
"Today," he added, "we join fans around the world in honoring the Queen of Rock and Roll, and a star whose light will never fade."
The actress Angela Bassett, who was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Ms. Turner in the 1993 film "What's Love Got to Do With It," said in a statement: "How do we say farewell to a woman who owned her pain and trauma and used it as a means to help change the world?"
"Through her courage in telling her story, her commitment to stay the course in her life, no matter the sacrifice, and her determination to carve out a space in rock and roll for herself and for others who look like her, Tina Turner showed others who lived in fear what a beautiful future filled with love, compassion, and freedom should look like," Ms. Bassett said. "Her final words to me -- for me -- were 'You never mimicked me. Instead, you reached deep into your soul, found your inner Tina, and showed her to the world."'
The R&B and soul singer Aaron Neville recalled when the Neville Brothers toured Europe with Ms. Turner in 1990, selling out shows with more than 70,000 fans in attendance. It was during that tour, he said, when he came up with the idea for his song, "The Roadie Song," as he watched the crew set up stages all across Europe.
"She showed us much love and respect," Mr. Neville wrote on Twitter. "I know she has a place in the heavenly band."
Ms. Turner's career began in the late 1950s, when she was in high school in East St. Louis, Ill., and spanned half a century, as she moved from singing R&B and soul into rock and pop. She was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with Mr. Turner in 1991 again as a solo artist in 2021.
She gave her final public performance in 2009 and then retired.
"Tina Turner was our voice," Mayor Eric Adams of New York wrote on Twitter. "She's an icon who knocked down boundaries, shook our soul and redefined music. She overcame so much to become an icon."
Kelly Rowland, the singer formerly of Destiny's Child, is part of a younger generation of singers who drew inspiration from Ms. Turner: "Thank you Queen, for giving us your all!" she wrote. "We Love You!!"
The R&B singer Ciara wrote: "Heaven has gained an angel. Rest in Paradise Tina Turner. Thank you for the inspiration you gave us all."
And rapper and songwriter Kid Cudi wrote that Ms. Turner was a hero to his mother, and "she was the ultimate superhero to me too."

Where Future Monarchs Learn to Be Social Butterflies: [Style Desk]

Full text: At Atlantic College, a school in a 12th-century castle clinging to the windy Welsh coastline, teenage royals take classes on world peace.
The rolling green lawns of a 12th-century castle perched on a windy stretch of the South Wales coastline hosted not one but two kings of Europe last weekend.
The purpose of the visit to St. Donat's by the royal families of Spain and the Netherlands was the graduation of their daughters from UWC Atlantic College, a high school housed in a remote castle once owned by the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst.
Under unusually bright blue skies on Saturday, Princess Alexia of the Netherlands, 17, smiled in a white linen trouser suit flanked by her parents, Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander (a former Atlantic College student himself) in a photograph posted on Instagram.
Princess Leonor of Asturias, who is also 17 and the heir to the Spanish throne, wore a scarlet red button down blazer dress with split sleeves as she posed for selfies with her parents and younger sister Princess Sofia, who is set to start there in September.
The scene was a reflection of how Atlantic College, which is part of the United World Colleges group, has become the school of choice for many young royals. It increasingly draws students who may have once gone to better-known places like Eton College in the shadow of Windsor Castle or Institut Le Rosey on the edge of Lake Geneva in Switzerland, considered the most expensive boarding school in the world.
Other recent alumni of the school, which educates students for their final two years of high school, include Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, who is Belgium's future queen. She graduated in 2021 and went on to study at Oxford.
The British press has pondered whether the British royal family may break with tradition and send its own young heirs to a school that has recently educated several future queens of Europe.
One Enduring Tradition: Discretion
Although UWC may have more of an updated atmosphere and curriculum than its more traditional counterparts, it does appear to subscribe to at least one very old -- and very royal -- convention: the art of being tight-lipped. The school did not respond to numerous requests for comment for this article, and seems to mostly avoid speaking to reporters.
Tori Cadogan, the education editor of the British society magazine Tatler, said that the appeal of Atlantic College has largely to do with an optimistic ideology rooted in "deliberate diversity" and world peace. The school enrolls plenty of children of royalty and other wealthy families, but there are also a significant number of less privileged students.
Tuition is expensive: about $ 82,000 for the two-year international baccalaureate program.
Many students receive financial aid, however, including a significant cohort who are victims of war or refugees on full scholarships. Their applications go to the U.W.C. national committee, which then assigns the students to United World College campuses around the world, perhaps in Thailand, Costa Rica, Norway or the United States.
Last week, the Dutch royal family announced that Princess Ariane of the Netherlands, the third and youngest daughter of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima, would attend the United World College Adriatic near Trieste, Italy.
Atlantic College opened in 1962 -- the height of the Cold War -- and the idea to make a diverse student body a priority came from Kurt Hahn (who founded Gordonstoun, King Charles's alma mater). He decided a new form of teaching, which emphasizes responsibility, internationalism and democracy, was needed to avoid another world war.
A statement on the school's website says the mission of the school is "to bring together young people from around the world to help create an atmosphere for peaceful coexistence between cultures and nations."
Leave the Rolex at Home
What, then, does a teenage princess do with her days at Atlantic? According to the "A Day in the Life" section of the school website, classes run from 8 a.m. to just after 1 p.m., with afternoons left open for community service at local hospitals and schools, as well as activities like kayaking, archery, planting in the greenhouse or working on the school farm, or even serving on the school's own lifeboat service. (According to the BBC, the widely used Rigid Inflatable Lifeboat was invented by students at the school in the early 1960s.)
Cellphone reception is said to be ghastly (likely to the delight of teachers and parents). "E.D.W.s" (excessive displays of wealth) are banned, which means no expensive watches or designer gear.
Louise Callaghan, a former student who is the Middle East correspondent for the Sunday Times, wrote a column in 2018 about her time at the school. She said it forced many students to "get very used to being around, and getting along with, people who are nothing like you."
These included, she wrote, "refugees from West Africa, Brits from across the social spectrum, California hippies, religious Malaysians." Learning how to interact with such a diverse group, she said, "is a useful life skill -- one, I imagine, you do not gain at a normal private school."
She also had a more lighthearted take on her time there. Atlantic College, she wrote, was a little like "a hippie Hogwarts."

Full text: Aiming to boost revenue and cater to a rising number of passengers willing to pay for premium seats, airlines are reconfiguring cabins and flying larger planes.
Does it seem like that long walk back to economy class goes past more and more rows of cushy premium seats? You may be right.
Driven by a rise in leisure travelers willing to pay more for a wider seat, extra legroom and a nicer meal in premium economy or first or business class, airlines are cashing in by reconfiguring their cabins to accommodate more of those higher-priced comfy seats, and using larger planes that have more premium seating on existing routes.
The moves are significant: Major U.S. airlines are expanding premium seating by 25 to 75 percent in portions of their fleets.
Leisure travelers began upgrading in earnest as the pandemic eased, said David Slotnick, who follows the aviation industry for the travel website the Points Guy. Still feeling the lingering fear of an airborne virus, some fliers felt safer with a little more space between them and the passenger next door, and were willing to pay more for it. And after months of not spending any travel dollars, there was a good deal of pent-up demand.
Premium seat prices fell during the pandemic because business travelers weren't flying, said Mr. Slotnick, giving leisure travelers a chance to experience life at the front of the plane in first, business and premium economy seats. Airlines noticed the appetite of these customers, and have been setting prices as high as they can while still feeling affordable, he said.
The price of airline tickets overall has also surged as inflation has risen and travelers have rushed to make up for lost time. At the same time, previously lagging business travel has started to pick up again.
Airlines see this shift in demand as a financial boon, said Chris Lopinto, a co-founder of ExpertFlyer, a website that provides seat maps, cabin upgrade availability and other information to frequent fliers. Aircraft are being upgraded with more premium seating to increase revenue per flight, Mr. Lopinto said.
Cabin retrofit projects are planned over several years and take into account the age of the existing interiors and customer demand and expectations, among other factors, according to Mark Muren, United Airlines' managing director for identity, product and loyalty. Planes need to be taken out of rotation to get this work done, so airlines don't undertake this work lightly, said Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Cowen, an investment bank.
United, for example, has increased the capacity of domestic premium seating -- which includes Economy Plus and first class -- by 25 percent overall compared with the beginning of 2019. In North America, there will be more than 53 premium seats per flight by 2026, about 75 percent more than there were in 2019. On some planes that fly internationally, United expanded the number of business class seats to 46 from 30 by removing some of the economy seats. Passengers are most likely to experience these changes on United's cross-country flights (between San Francisco and Newark, for example) or those to Hawaii, according to the aviation data analytics firm Cirium.
American also has plans to increase premium economy and business class seating, adding 45 percent more on long-haul flights by 2026. The carrier's Boeing 777-300ER, 787-9 and Airbus A321XLR jets will all offer more premium economy and business class seating. Those aircraft are typically used on long-haul international and transcontinental routes, according to the company, but the schedule has not been set for 2024 network routes yet, which is when the changes will begin to appear.
Delta will offer 15,000 more premium economy or business class seats a day compared with before the pandemic, according to the company. On Delta's 767-400 planes, 20 economy and six business class seats were taken out to make room for a 20-seat premium economy cabin. On some A330 models, 16 premium economy seats were removed to install 21 business class seats. Customers will most likely see the changes on Delta's trans-Atlantic routes, and possibly also on domestic routes like New York to Los Angeles, and Atlanta to Honolulu, according to analysis by Cirium.
Some of the cushiest seats are getting even more luxurious. Delta One "cabins," available on some international flights, offer full-height closing doors along with a lie-flat bed and other amenities.
The premium cabins may be growing, but if you want to lie back and enjoy one of these new seats, it's still going to cost you: In early May, a sample round-trip from New York to Los Angeles on the three major airlines for the first week of June started at about $ 300 for economy, $ 900 for premium economy and $ 1,200 for business.

Meta Is Fined $1.3 Billion Over E.U. Privacy Rules: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Facebook owner said it would appeal an order to stop sending data about European Union users to the United States.
Meta on Monday was fined a record 1.2 billion euros ( $ 1.3 billion) and ordered to stop transferring data collected from Facebook users in Europe to the United States, in a major ruling against the social media company for violating European Union data protection rules.
The penalty, announced by Ireland's Data Protection Commission, is potentially one of the most consequential in the five years since the European Union enacted the landmark data privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Regulators said the company failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the European Union's highest court that Facebook data shipped across the Atlantic was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.
But it remains unclear if or when Meta will ever need to cordon off the data of Facebook users in Europe. Meta said it would appeal the decision, setting up a potentially lengthy legal process.
At the same time, European Union and American officials are negotiating a new data-sharing pact that would provide legal protections for Meta and scores of other companies to continue moving information between the United States and Europe -- a pact that could nullify much of the European Union's ruling on Monday. A preliminary deal was announced last year.
The ruling, which comes with a grace period of at least five months before Meta needs to comply, applies only to Facebook and not to Instagram and WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. The company said there would be no immediate disruption to Facebook's service in the Europe Union.
Still, the E.U. decision shows how government policies are upending the borderless way that data has traditionally moved. As a result of data-protection rules, national security laws and other regulations, companies are increasingly being pushed to store data within the country where it is collected, rather than allowing it to move freely to data centers around the world.
The case against Meta stems from U.S. policies that give intelligence agencies the ability to intercept communications from abroad, including digital correspondence. In 2020, an Austrian privacy activist, Max Schrems, won a lawsuit to invalidate a U.S.-E.U. pact, known as Privacy Shield, that had allowed Facebook and other companies to move data between the two regions. The European Court of Justice said the risk of U.S. snooping violated the fundamental rights of European users.
"Unless U.S. surveillance laws get fixed, Meta will have to fundamentally restructure its systems," Mr. Schrems said in a statement on Monday. The solution, he said, is most likely a "federated social network" in which most personal data would stay in the European Union except for "necessary" transfers like when a European sends a direct message to somebody in the United States.
On Monday, Meta said it was being unfairly singled out for data-sharing practices used by thousands of companies.
"Without the ability to transfer data across borders, the internet risks being carved up into national and regional silos, restricting the global economy and leaving citizens in different countries unable to access many of the shared services we have come to rely on," Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, and Jennifer G. Newstead, the company's chief legal officer, said in a statement.
The ruling, which is a record fine under the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., could affect data related to photos, friend connections and direct messages stored by Meta. It has the potential to bruise Facebook's business in Europe, particularly if it hurts the company's ability to target ads. Last month, Susan Li, Meta's chief financial officer, told investors that about 10 percent of its worldwide ad revenue came from ads delivered to Facebook users in E.U. countries. In 2022, Meta had revenue of nearly $ 117 billion.
Meta and other companies are counting on the new data agreement between the United States and the European Union to replace the one invalidated by European courts in 2020. Last year, President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced the outlines of a deal in Brussels, but the details are still being negotiated.
Without a deal, the ruling against Meta shows the legal risks that companies face in continuing to move data between the European Union and United States.
Meta faces the prospect of having to delete vast amounts of data about Facebook users in the European Union, said Johnny Ryan, senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. That would present technical difficulties given the interconnected nature of internet companies.
"It is hard to imagine how it can comply with this order," said Mr. Ryan, who has pushed for stronger data-protection policies.
The decision against Meta was announced almost exactly on the five-year anniversary of G.D.P.R. Many civil society groups and privacy activists have said the data privacy law, initially held up as a model, has not fulfilled its promise because of a lack of enforcement.
Much of the criticism has focused on a provision that requires regulators in the country where a company has its European Union headquarters to enforce the far-reaching privacy law. Ireland, home to the regional headquarters of Meta, TikTok, Twitter, Apple and Microsoft, has faced the most scrutiny.
On Monday, the Irish authorities said they had been overruled by a board made up of representatives from E.U. countries. The board insisted on imposing the €1.2 billion fine and forcing Meta to address past data collected about users, which could include deletion.
"The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organizations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences," said Andrea Jelinek, the chairwoman of the European Data Protection Board, the E.U. body that set the fine.
Meta has been a frequent target of regulators under the G.D.P.R. In January, the company was fined €390 million for forcing users to accept personalized ads as a condition of using Facebook. In November, it was fined €265 million for a data leak.

Griner's W.N.B.A. Return Is Hailed as a 'Day of Joy': [Sports Desk]

Full text: Griner, the Phoenix Mercury center, played in her first two official games since was freed from prison. She didn't win either, but the moment meant far more than that.
PHOENIX -- The public address announcer paused before introducing the final player in the Mercury's starting lineup on Sunday. The song "Coming Home" by Skylar Grey began to play, and then Brittney Griner appeared on a red carpet with tall video screens behind her, an entrance befitting a rock star.
It was Griner's first regular-season home game since 2021. She missed last season because she was imprisoned in Russia, caught in a geopolitical showdown between Washington and Moscow. But on Sunday, minutes before her team faced the Chicago Sky, Griner stood with her arms crossed in an "X" in front of her chest to acknowledge the Mercury fan base, which has the nickname the X-factor. Then she ran down the red carpet and onto the court.
Griner embraced the Sky starters at half court, wiping tears as she tightened her shorts, tucked in her jersey and prepared for the tipoff. She scored the game's first 3 points, energizing the thousands of fans who had come to see her.
"Part of the process of healing is kind of just letting it out," Griner said. "So, yeah, I got choked up a little bit but tried to hide it."
Sunday's game against the Sky wrapped up Griner's first weekend back in the W.N.B.A., which began with a game against the Sparks in Los Angeles on Friday. The Mercury lost both games, though each felt more like a celebration or an All-Star Game where the final score doesn't really matter.
"It's a day of joy," Mercury Coach Vanessa Nygaard said before Friday's game, adding: "We brought back this woman -- this Black, gay woman -- from a Russian jail, and America did that because they valued her."
Customs officials at an airport near Moscow detained Griner in February 2022 after they found a small amount of a marijuana concentrate in vape cartridges in her luggage. The U.S. State Department said that she had been wrongfully detained, but she was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to nine years in a penal colony. Griner was freed in December as part of a prisoner exchange for Viktor Bout, an arms dealer nicknamed the Merchant of Death.
A week after her release, Griner made her first public statement on Instagram, saying she intended to play for the Mercury.
"I look forward to being able to say 'thank you' to those of you who advocated, wrote, and posted for me in person soon," she said. On Sunday, the Mercury gave fans orange T-shirts with that message written inside of an outline of Griner's face.
When Griner made that statement, after nearly 10 months in Russian custody, it seemed far-fetched that she could return to the court so soon. She had not been allowed to play basketball while she was detained. She was arguably the best player at her position when she last played; even if she did return, it seemed unlikely that she could quickly get back to that form.
But through her first two games, Griner has put those questions to rest. She and her teammates have acknowledged she isn't yet the player she once was, but Griner performed like the Mercury's best player over their first two games. She led the team in points and rebounds over the two losses, averaging 22.5 points, 8 rebounds, and 4 blocks.
"By All-Star, I hope to be exactly where I want to be," Griner said after the Sparks game. "You know, not having to limit my minutes, being able to just play -- I'm going to regret this, but -- being able to play 40 minutes. Just getting back to what I was before."
Before the Friday's game, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to both teams in their locker rooms, thanking them for supporting the campaign to bring Griner back to the United States.
"You have inspired so many people," Harris said, adding: "And for you to be back on the court, it's so incredible. And for all the people that look like us and need to know nothing is going to knock you down -- that's good."
Griner has shared few details of her imprisonment in Russia. In her first news conference last month, Mercury staff said she would not discuss Russia, and on Friday, she winked and told a reporter she would elaborate in her book, referring to a memoir set to be released next spring.
But the effect of her time in Russia has been clear in one regard: When the national anthem plays, Griner has stood with her teammates.
Before her detention in Russia, Griner had for some time chosen not to participate in the anthem because of anti-Black racism in the United States. But she said not being able to stand up comfortably in prison changed her perspective on standing for the anthem. Still, she said she supports players who do not stand for the anthem.
"One of the good things about the country is you have the right to protest," she said. "You have the right to speech, to be able to speak out, question, challenge, and do all these things. And you know what I went through, and everything just means a little bit more to me now."
In Los Angeles, several celebrities and athletes came to watch the game and support Griner, including Magic Johnson, Dawn Staley, Billie Jean King, Pau Gasol, Darvin Ham, and Leslie Jones. Staley, who was sitting courtside next to the Mercury bench near Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, laughed and joked with Brittney during the game's final minutes.
But, even with the celebrity-laden audience, the arena, which was filled with 10,396 fans, seemed to lack the energy expected for Griner's return, which bothered her coach.
"Honestly, come on now, L.A. We didn't sell out the arena for B.G.? Like, I expected more, to be honest," Nygaard said. "It was great. It was loud. But how was it not a sellout?"
The game was scheduled to begin at 11 p.m. Eastern but started about 20 minutes later and was pushed to ESPN2 as an N.H.L. playoff game went to overtime on ESPN. The late -- and delayed -- start seemed like a missed opportunity for one such a significant moment. W.N.BA. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the decision for Griner's first game to be on the road and starting so late was made before the league knew she would be back.
In Phoenix on Sunday, the Mercury fans welcomed Griner with a large crowd: 14,040 people. It wasn't a sellout, but from the beginning the crowd brought an energy that was missing in Los Angeles.
The loudest moment of the night, other than the introductions, came in the third quarter when Griner made a 3-pointer, rare for a center. She waved her hands and yelled to the crowd.
"I'm back," Griner yelled as she pounded her chest.

“You have inspired so many people,” Harris said, adding: “And for you to be back on the court, it’s so incredible. And for all the people that look like us and need to know nothing is going to knock you down — that’s good.”
Griner has shared few details of her imprisonment in Russia. In her first news conference last month, Mercury staff said she would not discuss Russia, and on Friday, she winked and told a reporter she would elaborate in her book, referring to a memoir set to be released next spring.
But the effect of her time in Russia has been clear in one regard: When the national anthem plays, Griner has stood with her teammates.
Before her detention in Russia, Griner had for some time chosen not to participate in the anthem because of anti-Black racism in the United States. But she said not being able to stand up comfortably in prison changed her perspective on standing for the anthem. Still, she said she supports players who do not stand for the anthem.
“One of the good things about the country is you have the right to protest,” she said. “You have the right to speech, to be able to speak out, question, challenge, and do all these things. And you know what I went through, and everything just means a little bit more to me now.”
In Los Angeles, several celebrities and athletes came to watch the game and support Griner, including Magic Johnson, Dawn Staley, Billie Jean King, Pau Gasol, Darvin Ham, and Leslie Jones. Staley, who was sitting courtside next to the Mercury bench near Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, laughed and joked with Brittney during the game’s final minutes.
But, even with the celebrity-laden audience, the arena, which was filled with 10,396 fans, seemed to lack the energy expected for Griner’s return, which bothered her coach.
“Honestly, come on now, LA We didn’t sell out the arena for B.G.? Like, I expected more, to be honest,” Nygaard said. “It was great. It was loud. But how was it not a sellout?”
The game was scheduled to begin at 11 p.m. Eastern but started about 20 minutes later and was pushed to ESPN2 as an NHL playoff game went to overtime on ESPN. The late — and delayed — start seemed like a missed opportunity for such a significant moment. WNB.Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the decision for Griner’s first game to be on the road and starting so late was made before the league knew she would be back.
In Phoenix on Sunday, the Mercury fans welcomed Griner with a large crowd: 14,040 people. It wasn’t a sellout, but from the beginning the crowd brought an energy that was missing in Los Angeles.
The loudest moment of the night, other than the introductions, came in the third quarter when Griner made a 3-pointer, rare for a center. She waved her hands and yelled to the crowd.
“I’m back,” Griner yelled as she pounded her chest.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The author of the new book "Quietly Hostile" is a fan of listening to Paul Mooney records, rereading "Gone Girl" and watching guys arguing about sports.
Like many people, Samantha Irby went a little feral during the pandemic lockdown.
This created a dilemma. She had signed a contract to write a book that would follow her 2020 best seller "Wow, No Thank You," but since her specialty is humor and bits about what's happening in her life, what could she write about if she wasn't leaving the couch?
"I started thinking of all the things I could do inside my house. I can watch QVC, I can listen to Dave Matthews. Thank goodness I went into anaphylactic shock during that time," she said, referring to a chapter in her new book "Quietly Hostile," out Tuesday, that raises the dramatic stakes since she did, in fact, have to leave her home in Kalamazoo, Mich., for the emergency room.
The book delves into, among other topics, "Sex and the City" and her work as one of the writers on its HBO follow-up, "And Just Like That ..." She received hate mail from fans who believed the series revival had somehow blasphemed their beloved Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. Her response in "Quietly Hostile" is an entire chapter devoted to her ideas about changing up episodes of the original series, like having Aidan murder Mr. Big.
"There has been no topic I've written about that has made anyone ever say, 'You can't do that,"' she said. "One of these days someone is going to be like, 'Girl, no.' So I feel very lucky."
From her home office in Michigan, Irby talked about her comedy inspirations, her favorite pillow and the podcasts that give her the pop culture fix she craves. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
'Inside the NBA'
My favorite thing about sports is listening to guys in uncomfortable-looking suits talk about and analyze them. I watch all the "dudes arguing about sports" shows, and my favorite guys are the ones on TNT -- my very close friends Shaq, Ernie, Chuck and Kenny. These are massive stars, but it feels like watching siblings bicker. It's very comforting to me.
The Modern Proper
Their recipes never miss, ever. They make approachable food you actually want to eat that looks like you could easily do it in your own kitchen. Take it from the laziest cook: Life is hard, I do not seek out other difficult things. If I'm doing something, you know a monkey could do it.
Old Paul Mooney Comedy Records
Paul is a genius and maybe the funniest stand-up comic who ever lived. People ask me about my influences and are always surprised when I start listing old dudes like Redd Foxx and Robin Harris and Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney. I don't have the self-esteem to compare myself to other writers. All these old, dead, raunchy comedians and Eddie Murphy's "Raw" and "Delirious" helped shape my humor as much as anything I've read.
Evanston, Ill.
Evanston is the best place on earth. It's cute without being precious or claustrophobically small, it has great restaurants that are fancy enough to impress people who are wondering why you didn't pick a nice place for dinner downtown, the schools are good enough that I can fool people into thinking I have more than a high school education (I do not), it's full of all my friends' very nice parents driving their little Subarus around, and it's on the lake, which is a selling point to people who enjoy being outside (not me).
'Who? Weekly' and 'The Read'
I like my low-stakes celebrity and pop culture news explained to me with jokes and spicy opinions, and these two brilliant podcasts never let me down. I trust the hosts implicitly. I have never missed an episode! My stepkids are 15 and 17, and you know teenagers, nothing exists outside their body or their phone, so they don't keep me hip. It's nice to have my pop culture delivered into my ears by people who are funny and know more than I do.
'Gone Girl'
The first time I read "Gone Girl," it knocked me out of my socks. It's such a good book -- so clever and so funny and detailed. I read it once a year. It's my comfort book, which probably means I'm a sicko, but I don't care! (BTW where is Gillian Flynn's next book? No pressure but also: PRESSURE. Girl, we miss you!)
My Car
I don't even have to go anywhere, I am perfectly happy being cocooned in a warm car with a heated seat and a book (by "a book" I mean "my phone"). I don't even like my current car that much, but I still would rather be sitting in it listening to the thoughts bouncing off the walls of my brain than almost any place else. You know how you burrito-wrap a baby and the baby stops crying? That's me in a car. I put the seatbelt on and the tears are gone. My wife knows that if I say I'm going to make a phone call in the car, it's definitely to talk about her.
At-Home Hair Clippers
I first shaved my head when I was 16, the day before I started my senior year of high school, and I haven't stopped cutting my own hair since. I've had many barbers and I've loved them all. I appreciate a crisp (unnecessary) lineup, but it's not like I'm in the N.B.A.; literally no one cares if I don't have an expertly crafted hairline.
Playlists
As a kid, I was always making mixtapes for people. Now you can make a playlist on whatever music platform you use, and it's much faster and less labor-intensive than in the olden days when you had to go buy a pack of 60-minute tapes and devote an entire afternoon to compiling the best songs that say, "Hey, I like you, but also there's plausible deniability if you are repulsed by me." I very intentionally make playlists with themes and post them on Instagram or put a link in my newsletter. I like to make hyper-specific playlists for myself ("7 Songs to Run Errands To"), but I also enjoy making them for my friends ("A Collection of Music That Will Trick You Into Thinking I'm Cool").
Gel Pillows
We got a new mattress a couple years ago and the salesman threw in two fancy gel pillows as a bonus. Now I'll never not have one. They don't get too hot, but the best feature is that if you, like I, are a side sleeper who prefers to kind of crunch your pillow into a makeshift bulging tube, you can do it. It'll stay crunched, and in the morning rather than crying because you broke your pillow, you can instead just mash it back to its original shape and not be sad. Genius technology! I am never going back.

Designing a 'Powerful' Look for Your Wedding Day: [Society Desk]

Full text: Sally LaPointe's first bridal collection bucks the constraints of tradition while celebrating brides who embrace their confidence and the risqué.
On April 4, Sally LaPointe, designer, co-founder and creative director of her namesake company, LaPointe, a ready-to-wear, monochromatic color-driven luxury fashion brand, took on an additional role -- host.
Ms. LaPointe, 38, clad in black, stood out instantly, perhaps almost purposefully, in her one-bedroom apartment, on Broome Street in SoHo, as everything was dripping in cream: the walls, shag carpet, couch, even the floor-to-ceiling drapes hiding her exposed closets. It seamlessly matched her first cream inspired bridal collection, which debuted last month online and in stores.
The 46-piece collection (31 new pieces and 15 from previous collections) offers an array of sexy and nontraditional bridal textures, designs and stylings. There are feathers, sequins, faux leather blazers, cropped tops and thong bodysuits paired with high-waisted pants.
The LaPointe brand was conceived in 2010, and Bergdorf Goodman showcased its first collection three years later. When business flourished and more stores began offering the brand, so did the number of celebrities wearing it, like Jennifer Lopez, Jill Biden, Zendaya and Jessica Chastain, among others.
To celebrate the bridal line, 20 or so friends, brand ambassadors and influencers, some whom arrived decked out in full bridal offerings, were invited to a champagne and caviar-filled showcase of the collection in her apartment. Though editors had previewed the release in October with a digital lookbook, Ms. LaPointe and Sarah Adelson, the brand's co-founder, co-owner and chief executive, thought a party would be more personal and a deviation from past previews.
"We stopped doing runway, which we had done from the beginning, when Covid happened, so we had to think of other nontraditional ways to show," said Ms. LaPointe, a Massachusetts native and graduate from Rhode Island School of Design. "The runway is drama, it's an amazing moment, but an event like tonight is smaller and more intimate. I get face time with people in my apartment which makes it personal."
What made you include bridal this year?
Bridal was a natural evolution. Though cream is in our main collection, it's very tight, maybe 10 pieces, because we do a lot of colors. We noticed clients were wearing our cream pieces to their weddings, at bachelorette parties, the morning after breakfasts and engagement parties. They would tag us on Instagram. We would get feedback from retail stores. It caught on. So, I jumped on it and turned the line around within six months.
In 2021, you went through a divorce. Was this collection more emotional for you?
Every collection I do somehow mirrors what I go through in my personal life. This was about finding my voice, being confident and infusing that into these pieces for other people that perhaps are like me. It became about being OK with who you are.
I lost my voice and found it in this collection. When you're attached to someone so closely there's no way you can't lose a piece of yourself. We were together for 10 years and married for four. When you partner with someone you meld into one. I'm seeing myself now as an individual. I think regaining that has been empowering for me.
This collection is about transformation and bringing out the confidence to be alone. It's about learning to be by yourself, to be an individual and to not be afraid to be who you really are without being attached to someone else.
What do you attribute the rise in nontraditional bridal looks to?
The traditional idea of weddings has changed. Covid made people think outside the box about how to get married. That was exciting. That catapulted the line. People are doing shotgun weddings or going to Vegas. They're doing small, intimate dinners. Weddings don't have to be this big production. That translated in fashion. You don't have to wear the ball gown or be a princess. Brides can mix and match pieces. I love wearing a suit to weddings. It's a feeling of power.
Why is that feeling of power so important to you, and how do you visually translate that into bridal wear?
I love powerful women who own who they are, and own a room when they walk in. I'm proud to have dressed some of them -- Adele, Beyoncé, Oprah, Lizzo, Rihanna. When I was a guest at weddings, I would shun the idea of wearing a cocktail dress. I'd wear a suit. I thought it was very confident and challenged the traditional idea of what you're supposed to wear to a wedding.
How are your designs different from other bridal designers?
I'm a master disguiser because I'm not a size 2. I know where to hide things. A lot goes into my designs: creating perfect proportions, where things hit, how to adjust the sleeves so that it's not bulky, using fabrics that stretch. I'm shunning the idea of a gown and doing separates. There's a thong bodysuit with a see-through pant; it's a little risqué and a little naughty. I'm not afraid to go there. There's a see-through cupro pant with feathers down the side; also double face satin and lace-up dresses. I did sheer trench coats, pants that have high-slit cuts, feathered bridal suits and cutout bodysuits. It's mixing sequins with a crop top instead of doing a sequined dress. These are sexy, pretty pieces for the bride who's not afraid to have attitude.
Was it hard designing bridal outfits while you were experiencing a breakup?
I had to shut down wondering how everyone was going to think about this collection. Are people going to like it? Will people understand it? I wanted to present something that's not overthought. I'm providing this new bride, who could potentially be me, or another version of me, confidence. Our bride is inspired and optimistic. She's a cool, rad, powerful woman who's inspired by love. That inspires me.

Andy Rourke, 59, Bassist for Smiths: [Biography]

Author: Marshall, Alex; Williams, Alex

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His sinewy bass lines were a vital -- if, as one writer put it, "habitually unsung" -- part of the influential British rock band's success.
Andy Rourke, the bass player who provided the muscle and drive behind the darkly poetic musings of the Smiths, one of the most influential bands of the 1980s, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 59.
A representative said he died of pancreatic cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Center.
While Mr. Rourke -- along with the band's drummer, Mike Joyce -- received a tiny share of the accolades (and revenues), his sinewy bass lines provided both heft and melodicism behind Morrissey's lachrymose vocals, which bounced between elegiac and funereal, and Johnny Marr's intricate, layered guitar work, which could be almost symphonic in its complexity.
"The nature of the music that we were playing in the Smiths meant that the sound needed a bit more of a kick," Mr. Rourke said in a 2019 interview with Bass Player magazine. "And because it's me," he added, "every time I do something, I do it big."
Mr. Rourke's playing, influenced by Paul McCartney and John Entwistle of the Who, was always "habitually unsung," David Cavanagh, an Irish journalist, wrote in 1993, but it was also "incontrovertibly top drawer."
Discerning listeners understood Mr. Rourke's value. Morrissey once said that Mr. Rourke was good enough to have been in Elvis Presley's band. "He didn't ever know his own power, and nothing that he played had been played by someone else," Morrissey wrote in a tribute on his website after Mr. Rourke's death.
Mr. Rourke's nimble, often effervescent bass lines were often foregrounded in landmark songs like "This Charming Man," "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now" and "Cemetery Gates," all of which transformed the Smiths into a cult act in the United States and a chart-topping group in their home country.
Andrew Michael Rourke was born in Manchester, England, on Jan. 17, 1964. He met Mr. Marr at school in Manchester in 1975.
"We were best friends, going everywhere together," Mr. Marr wrote in a recent Instagram post, adding, "I soon came to realise that my mate was one of those rare people that absolutely no one doesn't like."
The Smiths formed in Manchester in 1982. The group had a couple of bassists before Mr. Marr brought in his childhood friend.
In a 2012 interview with The Guardian, Mr. Rourke recalled playing his first show with the band in a tiny gay club. The Smiths always "rehearsed to death," he said, so it was not surprising when they quickly soared in popularity.
As they rose to prominence, the four Smiths were inseparable. "We were a gang," he told Mojo. "A very tight band of brothers. When we were at our peak, nobody could penetrate that." Within two years, the Smiths had their first Top 10 hit in Britain with "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now."
But success brought problems, including a heroin habit that Mr. Rourke developed. "You start getting a bunch of money and you don't know what to do," he recalled in a 2011 interview. "You start spending it on drugs."
In 1986, Morrissey fired Mr. Rourke, reportedly via postcard, because of his drug use. But he soon rejoined the band.
The Smiths broke up for good in 1987 after releasing four albums. Two years later, Mr. Rourke and Mr. Joyce, the drummer, began legal proceedings against their former bandmates, claiming that they had been equal partners and should have been paid a bigger split of the royalties. (They had been given only 10 percent.)
Mr. Rourke eventually dropped his case after being offered 83,000 pounds (about $ 100,000). But Mr. Joyce went to court and a judge found in his favor, saying that Morrissey should pay him compensation of around a million pounds, according to news reports at the time.
As late as 2007, Mr. Rourke told the BBC that the Smiths' breakup "still smarts a bit." Still, not long after the split, he laid down bass tracks for solo singles by Morrissey like "Interesting Drug" (1989) and "Last of the Famous International Playboys" (1990).
Post-Smiths, he also played on albums by Sinead O'Connor and the Pretenders and toured with Badly Drawn Boy. In 2009, Mr. Rourke moved to New York, where he performed at clubs with the D.J. Olé Koretsky in a duo called Jetlag, which evolved into a band called D.A.R.K. when they enlisted Dolores O'Riordan of the Cranberries.
Information on survivors was not immediately available.
Long after his Smiths days, Mr. Rourke was asked about the origins of his melodic style. "It was just my love of bass playing," he said.
"If I wasn't eating or in the bath," he added, "I had a bass in my hand."

Fallen Leader From Britain Visits Taiwan, Roiling China: [Foreign Desk]

Author: Buckley, Chris

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Liz Truss, the former British prime minister, met Taiwan's leader, who has sought to push back against China's efforts to isolate the island democracy.
On a controversial trip to Taiwan, Liz Truss, Britain's prime minister for 44 tempestuous days, met President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday and called for an "economic NATO" to counter Chinese coercion.
Ms. Truss's visit has been denounced by Beijing, which claims the self-governed island as its territory. China opposes visits to Taiwan by foreign politicians, even fallen ones like Ms. Truss, who resigned last year after the shortest tenure of any British prime minister. And even some members of Ms. Truss's own Conservative Party suggested her trip was unnecessarily provocative -- "the worst kind of Instagram diplomacy," said one.
Taiwan's government has nonetheless treated Ms. Truss's five-day visit as a small but welcome gesture of support in the face of Beijing's tightening political isolation of the island democracy. Taiwan now has only 13 formal diplomatic partners -- most states have shifted recognition to Beijing -- and Taiwan has increasingly reached out to foreign lawmakers, think tanks and organizations to promote its global standing.
"Taiwan and the United Kingdom are like-minded partners," Ms. Tsai told Ms. Truss when they met at Taiwan's presidential office. "Together we are working to advance freedom and democracy around the world."
As she had earlier on her trip, Ms. Truss said in her meeting with Ms. Tsai that countries should band together and form an "economic NATO": a bloc united against coercion by China and other authoritarian governments. China has often resorted to economic retaliation in diplomatic disputes with other countries, imposing punishing tariffs and informal embargoes on Australia, Norway, South Korea and other countries. (Beijing also faces trade and technology restrictions imposed by the United States and its allies.)
"What has been achieved here in Taiwan must be protected, and the international community and international free democracies must support you in your endeavors," Ms. Truss told Ms. Tsai.
The Chinese Embassy in Britain, in a statement on Wednesday called Ms. Truss's visit "a dangerous political show." While the full measure of China's reaction to the trip, which ends Saturday, remained to be seen, it seemed unlikely to go beyond angry words.
Last year, China launched large-scale military exercises near Taiwan after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taipei. But Britain is far less consequential than the United States in supporting Taiwan. As House speaker, Ms. Pelosi held a powerful role in policymaking in Washington; by contrast, Ms. Truss was unceremoniously pushed from power.
China's leader, Xi Jinping, has also been focused this year on improving relations with European countries, including Britain, as he tries to thwart the Biden administration's efforts to build an international coalition against Beijing.
The last former British prime minister to visit Taiwan was Ms. Truss's political idol, Margaret Thatcher, in 1992. Taiwan was willing to look past contention in Britain over Ms. Truss, said Chen Fang-yu, an assistant politics professor at Soochow University in Taipei.
"Taiwan really needs more of this kind of attention from every country, because only if more people visit Taiwan and more speak up for Taiwan, will the Chinese Communist Party realize that many people are paying attention to Taiwan, and so they should not act rashly," he said in an interview.
This week, Taiwan also launched a push for international support to rejoin the World Health Organization and attend the World Health Assembly that opens on Sunday. Taiwan was an observer in the organization from 2009 to 2016, but China blocked its participation after Ms. Tsai was elected president.
And on Thursday, the Biden administration emphasized U.S. support for Taiwan by announcing that it had concluded its first agreement under a trade initiative begun last year. The agreement will reduce red tape for firms shipping goods between the two sides and promote trade by small businesses.
Ms. Truss's trip has also come as Taiwan is preparing to hold a presidential election in January, when voters will choose a successor for Ms. Tsai, who must step down.
On Thursday, Ms. Truss met Lai Ching-te, the vice president of Taiwan, who is the presidential candidate of Ms. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party. That party favors asserting Taiwan's separateness from China, and its formal platform calls for establishing Taiwan "as a sovereign, independent and autonomous nation," a goal that is anathema to Beijing. Mr. Lai used his meeting with Ms. Truss on Thursday to amplify that message of standing tall against Chinese pressure.
But Alexander C. Huang, a professor at Tamkang University in Taipei who advises Taiwan's opposition Nationalist Party, said that the Nationalists would also welcome visitors like Ms. Truss. The Nationalists maintain that they can create more stable relations with China, while keeping Taiwan close to the United States and its allies. The Nationalists anointed their candidate for the presidency, Hou Yu-ih, this week.
"Taiwan has no influence over the domestic issues of a friendly country," Mr. Huang said, referring to Britain. "We just want to have more international attention and visibility."

A Saucy Recipe for Reinvention: [Style Desk]

Full text: The domestic diva talks about shedding her inhibitions, and (most of) her clothes, for the cover shoot.
It's useless to try to pigeonhole Martha Stewart. Decorously entertaining homemaker-slash-lifestyle guru, television personality, publisher, canny entrepreneur-turned-white-collar criminal, Snoop Dogg's unlikely BFF -- these are labels she spins, or drops when it suits her, as adroitly as a juggler.
Resisting attempts to peg or malign her, Ms. Stewart has survived, even thrived, "not as a Superwoman," as Joan Didion once put it, "but as an Everywoman."
But now, at 81, she seems intent on shrugging off that label as well, swapping her "domestic goddess" persona for something a little saucier: badass Martha, a hottie who, it would seem, will shuck her inhibitions as lightly as an ear of corn.
In recent months, Ms. Stewart has teased her four million Instagram followers with goofily seductive, demiclad snaps of herself. She promoted her partnership with Green Mountain Coffee wearing an apron, halter-style, over what seemed to be nothing at all. She baited her fans, pouting suggestively at the edge of her pool. And she followed those antics with a naughty throwback, her 1996 Spy magazine cover, a siren on a seashell, knees hugged to her chest to cover her nudity.
And now, in what some may consider the ultimate stroke of bravado, Ms. Stewart appears on one of the four covers of the storied Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, which dropped on May 15.
She is not the first woman over 60 to appear on the cover. At 74, Maye Musk claimed that distinction. But Ms. Stewart may well be the most candidly cheerful participant in what seems a bid by Sports Illustrated to court controversy and hang on to its relevance.
Her experience was a novelty and simultaneously a test of grit, Ms. Stewart said, her voice warmly husky over the phone. In an interview, edited below, she talked about flirting, Madonna, how she came by her sexual confidence and more.
What gave you the gumption to pose?
Actually this was a rather large challenge. I had to make sure I was ready to pose in a bathing suit. It took a bit of vanity but also a bit of confidence. I thought, "If I'm feeling good enough physically and mentally to do such a thing, I'm up for it."
Did it take a lot of prep work?
I'm still healthy, my hair is nice, and my skin is good. As for filters, forget it. I keep my facial appointments with Mario Badescu. I've done that once a month religiously for 40-something years.
And your body?
I had two months, basically, to make sure I felt good enough about the way I look. If I'd thought my waist was too big, or that I was too wobbly, I wouldn't have done it. But after working in Pilates three times a week, I thought I could. Also, I went to the tanning booth and had a very light spray tan, something I've never done.
Were there physical challenges during the shoot?
I had to wear nine different bathing suits. All these people were prodding me and talking about "the girls." I have never called my breasts "the girls" in my life. I hate stuff like that. The whole time, these people were nudging, "Poke this out, push that in." I had to put up with that for eight hours. Still, we were shooting in the Dominican Republic and I had a really good time.
How do you come by the sexual confidence to pull off a move like this?
It doesn't have as much to do with blatant sex as with a self-assurance that started when I was a child. So, when the offer came, I thought, "I can do this. I don't have to give in to convention." How else would I, as an 81-year-old, have talked myself into feeling good about getting into a bathing suit?
There are people who find nothing quite as steamy as your competence at work. What do you make of that?
I just returned from four and a half hours at Breads Bakery in Union Square. I had to bake a challah in the shape of a crown, something I had never done before. When I finished, that bread looked better than the baker's version. But I'm a teacher and kind of an artist.
An artist who makes kneading dough look sexy?
I pride myself on being able to show you physically as well as verbally how to do things.
Do you flirt?
Oh, do I. Of course I do. I'm not shy. I find certain men very attractive. If I am at a social event, I will make sure that I talk to those very attractive men.
About a year ago you joked with Chelsea Handler that while you're no home-wrecker, you are waiting for friends to die so you can swoop down on their husbands. Do you stand by that?
I don't take it back. But, well ... the husbands do tend to go first. And, really, I prefer younger men.
Are you posing in a swimsuit to counter an image that once seemed starchy, even downright intimidating? Are you rebranding?
No, this is part of my ongoing self-creation -- I call it education. One of my mottos for many years has been, when you're through changing, you're through.
You seem to share that conviction with Madonna. Yet when Madonna, who is 64, turned up at the Grammys in February with her face showing signs of a cosmetic procedure, she caught a lot of flak. So far, you have not.
I would never compare myself to someone like Madonna. She is a talent like no other. But as a performer she needs to keep reinventing herself. And it's much more difficult for her to alter herself without altering her face. I don't want to do that.
But there's another very big difference between me and Madonna: She is wearing pointy bras and weird clothes. I'm teaching you how to roll dough.

Full text: Fashion lovers flocked to shop from the star's collection of garments in what was advertised on social media as the "sale of the century."
For a certain kind of fashion fiend, it was a dream: shop the actress Chloë Sevigny's closet, with her present.
Ms. Sevigny, lauded as a fashion influencer and enthusiast, held a sale on Mother's Day in a studio space in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. Customers had the chance to buy items from Ms. Sevigny's own wardrobe, Academy New York, pieces she had designed with Opening Ceremony, and costumes from various roles.
"I decided to properly care for or store some things in Los Angeles," said Ms. Sevigny, who wore a black Comme des Garçons shirtdress and Manolo Blahnik slides. "And then there was a lot left over and I was like, you know what, I'm 48, I'm a mother, there's a lot of stuff I don't want to wear anymore. This is a big purge to pay for a few years of storage, give a chunk to a charity and pay for some more storage."
The event was organized by Liana Satenstein, a former Vogue writer whose "Schmatta Shrink" service helps fashionistas clear out their closets and has evolved into a video series called Never Worns, where she tells the stories behind those clothes.
The sale was announced on Thursday via Instagram, under the title "Sale of the Century." Ms. Sevigny was joined by the fashion editors Mickey Boardman (formerly of Paper Magazine), Lynn Yaeger (a contributing editor to Vogue) and Sally Singer (formerly of Vogue; now at Amazon), all hawking their clothes.
By noon, when the sale officially opened, a line snaked completely around the block; some customers had left their homes in New Jersey at 5:30 in the morning. "It's like ouroboros, or the human centipede of fashion," Ms. Satenstein said.
Mr. Boardman was seated in a side room with his friend Laura Wills, the owner of the vintage store Screaming Mimi's, while Ms. Singer ran the till, which was in fact mostly Venmo. Was this her first experience working retail? "Sadly, no," Ms. Singer said.
As the first customers charged out of the elevator, they had to pause. There was Ms. Sevigny, welcoming shoppers, gamely posing for selfies and doling out fashion advice. "You have to buy that," she told Bella Raykhman, a 24-year-old art director considering some $ 145 denim chaps by Katharine Hamnett.
Ms. Raykhman said, "It might have been a marketing strategy, but it was effective."
Ms. Sevigny held up a tiny leather miniskirt she said was from the 1990s. "It's Michael Kors for Celine," she said. "During my Oscar campaign for 'Boys Don't Cry,' I wore this to different press events." Nearby was a denim jacket and matching pants with a leafy print, a collaboration between Levi's and Supreme. "I dated a boy who worked at Supreme for a while, so I used to get hooked up," she said. "They still hook me up, because they like me."
While a lone speaker blared Britney Spears, Madonna and Sonic Youth, shoppers -- mostly women in their 20s -- browsed items like an Hermès shearling coat ( $ 1,995), a Lord & Taylor leather blazer ( $ 135) and black Supreme shorts with the Playboy bunny near the hem ( $ 150). "These are forever pieces in my closet," said Abby Tompkins, a 26-year-old music marketer. She came for "the essential New York It girl look," she said. "I'm already planning outfits in my head."
Asha McDonald, a 29-year-old stylist, was trying to decide between a plaid Vivienne Westwood skirt ( $ 450) and an armful of other items. The time had come to make a call. "It's either now or I'm going to get a bladder infection," she said. There were no restrooms.
Ms. Sevigny was still at the sale at 3, sorting clothes, moving mules from the floor to a more prominent rack where space had cleared up. Chelsea Manning stopped by, as well as Ivy Getty, a socialite and model, who admired a tiny sheer camisole dress in cyan. "That's Versace!" Ms. Sevigny yelled to her from a couch.
Ms. Sevigny stayed until the bitter end, with the sale extending its hours until 6 (it was supposed to end at 5), when the very last pilgrims made it through the door. Ms. Satenstein said later that about 90 percent of the clothes were sold.
"I thought more people would rip things out of people's hands," said Rebecca Snyder, 22, a student who had waited for more than four hours with her friends. "It honestly ended up being really chill. It's not that deep. It's just clothes."

NEW YORK — For a certain kind of fashion fiend, it was a dream: shop actress Chloë Sevigny’s closet, with her present.
Sevigny, lauded as a fashion influencer and enthusiast, held a sale on Mother’s Day in a studio space in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. Customers had the chance to buy items from Sevigny’s own wardrobe, Academy New York, pieces she had designed with Opening Ceremony, and costumes from various roles.
“I decided to properly care for or store some things in Los Angeles,” said Sevigny, who wore a black Comme des Garçons shirtdress and Manolo Blahnik slides. “And then there was a lot left over and I was like, you know what, I’m 48, I’m a mother, there’s a lot of stuff I don’t want to wear anymore.

Harlem Socialist Won't Seek 2nd Term: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Kristin Richardson Jordan was celebrated as part of the rising progressive movement. Now, after just one term, she has decided not to run for re-election.
Kristin Richardson Jordan, a democratic socialist who is among the most left-leaning elected officials in New York City, announced on Tuesday that she was abruptly withdrawing from next month's Democratic primary and would not seek re-election to the City Council.
Her upset victory in a Harlem Council race by 100 votes just two years ago was seen by some as a watershed moment for the city's ascendant progressive movement, a sign that voters could accept a politician whose views included abolishing the Police Department.
The Nation, a left-leaning magazine, said in a celebratory piece that a "Black lesbian" and "radical poet" had complicated the narrative about Black voters and the leftist agenda. A political action committee associated with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, gave her its stamp of approval.
Then things got messy. Ms. Jordan was dinged for using Council funds to promote her campaign. Her hard-line positions on policing, housing development and the war in Ukraine drew backlash from colleagues and voters. She failed to form alliances even with natural ideological allies, as she missed nearly half of her committee meetings, city records show.
On Tuesday, facing three more moderate primary challengers and a looming flood of negative advertising from powerful interest groups, she bowed to the reality of her diminished support and withdrew from the June 27 primary.
"Thank you for seeing the true possibility for radical love in the loveless land of politics," she wrote in a message to supporters on Instagram. She vowed to continue to fight "for community care, economic justice, abolition, liberation, and radical societal change." She did not respond to requests for comment.
Ms. Jordan's exit comes at a complicated moment for the left across the country. Progressives are still celebrating the swearing in of Brandon Johnson as Chicago's new mayor on Monday and hoping that Tuesday's mayoral contest in Philadelphia extends a string of big-city mayoral victories.
But the movement's electoral progress has slowed in New York of late, where moderate Democrats lead the city and state governments.
Critics and supporters of Ms. Jordan alike cautioned that it was not her ideology as much as her job performance and inability to form coalitions that led to her undoing.
"The City Council is a place where activists are called to govern, but she misunderstood her role," said Antonio Reynoso, the borough president of Brooklyn who is a progressive Democrat and former councilman. "There are many other activists on the City Council who understand their purpose and also know how to govern."
Ms. Jordan was facing challenges from three more moderate Democrats: Inez Dickens, a state assemblywoman who formerly held the Harlem Council seat; Al Taylor, another assemblyman; and Yusef Salaam, one of five Black and Latino men who was exonerated in 2002 in the rape and assault of a female jogger in Central Park in 1989. Despite dropping out, Ms. Jordan's name is likely to remain on the ballot.
As Primary Day inched closer, Ms. Jordan had declined to appear at two recent community forums with her fellow candidates and increasingly criticized the meanspiritedness of politics and the media.
It was also becoming clear that Ms. Jordan was going to face an onslaught of outside spending had she stayed in the race. An unlikely coalition of real estate developers, a pro-Israel group and some of the city's largest labor unions were considering independent expenditures to damage her candidacy. They included the New York City District Council of Carpenters, 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union and the nation's largest police union, the Police Benevolent Association.
A video advertising truck with a big picture of Ms. Jordan asking "Have you seen this person?" was recently spotted on the streets of Harlem.
"It was going to be our No. 1 priority to take her out," said Kevin Elkins, the political director for the carpenters' union, a group that clashed with the councilwoman over a project to build an affordable housing development in Harlem.
Ms. Jordan rejected the plan because she said its units were not affordable enough for Harlem residents. The developer turned the site into an erstwhile truck depot.
Even though Ms. Jordan prevailed in 2021 over Bill Perkins (Mr. Perkins died early Tuesday at his home in Harlem, according to his wife), she did not at the time have the official endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America or the Working Families Party, the standard bearers of the left in New York.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's political group, Courage to Change, however, said she was its first choice in that crowded race. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who has yet to make any endorsements in Council races this year, declined to comment.
Jaslin Kaur, who helps lead the city's D.S.A. chapter, said on Tuesday that Ms. Jordan had been unfairly maligned.
"She was attacked relentlessly for the program she was elected to pursue, with attacks coming from both mainstream Democrats from Jordan's upset victory against their electoral machine, as well as right-wing media outlets," she said.

Full text: The Federal Trade Commission said the deal would enable Amgen to exploit its size to block competition for two expensive Horizon drugs.
The News
The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday sued to block the drug maker Amgen's $ 27.8 billion acquisition of the pharmaceutical company Horizon Therapeutics, saying it would thwart competition in the drug industry.
The F.T.C. said the deal would allow Amgen to exploit a maneuver known as bundling, in which pharmaceutical companies take advantage of their large portfolios of drugs to offer discounts to insurers and others in exchange for favoring their products. The agency pointed to two expensive Horizon medications that lack competition, saying that bundling would entrench those monopolies.
The commission's move is its most aggressive yet after years of signaling that it would be tougher in scrutinizing pharmaceutical mergers. Its commissioners voted 3 to 0 to approve filing the suit.
Holly Vedova, a senior commission official, said the agency's lawsuit "sends a clear signal to the market: The F.T.C. won't hesitate to challenge mergers that enable pharmaceutical conglomerates to entrench their monopolies at the expense of consumers and fair competition."
Amgen said the merger did not pose competitive issues and that it would not bundle the two Horizon products.
The merger, announced late last year, was poised to be one of the largest pharmaceutical deals in recent years.
The F.T.C. has long forced merging pharmaceutical companies to sell off drugs that treat the same types of diseases, but it is much rarer for it to try to quash a merger altogether. This case is unusual because Amgen and Horizon do not sell competing products.
Background: The F.T.C. has been challenging corporate deals
Under the Biden administration, the F.T.C. has challenged corporate mergers for reasons that go beyond traditional antitrust concerns about overlapping products.
The F.T.C. chair, Lina Khan, has been very skeptical of corporate mergers in the tech industry. For example, the agency unsuccessfully tried to block Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, from buying a small virtual reality start-up, a rare challenge to an acquisition in a nascent market for an unproven product.
The F.T.C.'s move to try to block the Amgen-Horizon merger because of concerns about bundling is also unusual. "It tells us that the F.T.C. is considering new theories of harm that have not been front and center before," said Michael Carrier, an expert on antitrust issues in the pharmaceutical industry at Rutgers Law School.
Why It Matters: Bundling can keep drug prices high
The F.T.C.'s concern about bundling in the Amgen-Horizon merger is linked to concerns about high drug prices.
There has been increased attention to the rebates that drug companies offer to insurers and the industry middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers in exchange for favoring their drugs. By offering deep discounts through bundling, a company can prevent competitors from gaining market share or discourage them from even trying to enter the market. That can keep prices high.
In the case of Amgen and Horizon, the F.T.C. said, the merger would enable Amgen to pressure insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to favor two expensive Horizon drugs for rare conditions. The drugs treat an autoimmune disease, thyroid eye disease, and an inflammatory condition, chronic refractory gout.
Amgen's promise to the F.T.C. not to bundle the two Horizon products would be difficult for regulators to enforce. Drug negotiations are confidential, and drug makers have a long history of finding creative ways to get around such commitments, said Ameet Sarpatwari, an expert in pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.
What's Next: The case will move to court
Amgen and Horizon said that they would not abandon the deal and would go to court to try to push through the merger by mid-December. The outcome is likely to be decided by a federal court in Illinois, where the F.T.C. filed its lawsuit.
"How it plays out will serve as a litmus test for the ability to use antitrust law as a way to promote affordable access to pharmaceuticals," Dr. Sarpatwari said.

Full text: In Marion Siéfert's much-anticipated new show, the French director explores the dynamics of online grooming.
The French stage director Marion Siéfert has her finger on the pulse of our digital lives. In "2 or 3 Things I Know About You," she playfully tackled oversharing on Facebook, before turning to the perils of online streaming in "_jeanne_dark_" -- a show that fell foul of Instagram's moderation policies when it was relayed live on the platform.
With "Daddy," a sharp, no-holds-barred new production at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, in Paris, Siéfert has ventured even further into the internet's dark corners. In it, a 13-year-old is groomed online by an older man and gets lost in a virtual reality game that exploits teenage girls for profit.
It also marks a new stage in Siéfert's career. "Daddy" is her first big-budget production for a major playhouse, and one of the Paris season's most anticipated premieres. So Siéfert is swinging much bigger, on every level: larger cast, more atmospheric sets and a somewhat indulgent running time of three and a half hours. Yet her biting originality remains intact.
Reality is no match for screen entertainment in "Daddy." The central character, Mara, is a quiet teenager from southern France. A subtly written scene, early on, introduces her family: Her parents, a nurse and a security guard, are too exhausted by their poorly paid jobs to devote much attention to their daughters. It's no surprise that whenever she can, Mara escapes to the brighter landscape of online gaming.
In an unnamed video game, she joins Julien, a smooth-talking 27-year-old who is her frequent online partner in crime. The easy intimacy they have built is showcased through a spectacular video sequence: On a screen the size of the Odéon's stage, we see a 3-D game designed by the video artist Antoine Briot in which Mara and Julien's avatars who shoot at enemies with assault rifles before hopping on fluorescent skateboards.
Throughout, we hear Mara and Julien banter over their headsets. "You're the most badass girl in this game," Julien says.
The groundwork is laid for the abusive dynamic that ensues. When they first meet outside the game, on a video call, Mara confides in Julien that she dreams of being an actress. He compliments her, and tells her about "Daddy" -- a new game that allows players, Julien says, to become avatars sponsored by sugar daddies, and showcase their talents to a "fan base."
Siéfert has a knack for assembling captivatingly unconventional actors, and just as "_jeanne_dark_" was tailor-made for Helena de Laurens, a shape-shifter unafraid to lean into grotesque physicality, "Daddy" owes much to its two central performers. As Mara, the 15-year-old Lila Houel, who came to the production with limited stage experience, is coarsely candid in these early scenes, with turns of phrase that emphasize the character's working-class background. Opposite her, Louis Peres, best known as a screen actor, is a startling tech-generation descendant of Christian Bale in "American Psycho": clean-cut, in control, smoothly scary.
Siéfert's smartest move is to leave video and special effects behind once the two enter the game world of "Daddy." The virtual space becomes a sinister, near-empty stage dotted with what look like snow mounds, where Mara encounters other preyed-upon young women.
The rules of "Daddy" aren't wholly clear. Men invest so teenage girls can perform routines that earn them points with fans. Houel, for instance, interprets a scene from the movie "Interview with the Vampire"; the sparkling Jennifer Gold, who plays the game's reigning star Jessica, delivers cabaret-style numbers, including Marilyn Monroe's "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" from the 1960 film "Let's Make Love."
The points and the fans are never shown -- Siéfert keeps things deliberately vague. The focus is on the dynamics of child abuse, and the erosion of Mara's individuality and willpower by Julien. While some scenes of verbal and physical violence are troubling enough to make you fear for Houel's mental health, she rises to the occasion with astonishing sang-froid, quietly haunted then seething in the second act.
Siéfert co-wrote "Daddy" with Matthieu Bareyre, and some of the points they make don't need so much time to come across: Cuts would be welcome. Yet "Daddy" speaks to the zeitgeist and the lives of teenagers today with a mix of ease and critical distance that few stage directors can match.
And even at 11:30 p.m., one final scene had the audience sitting up and leaning forward. After a bloody narrative twist, the back wall of the stage slid away to reveal the street outside, and a performer staggered out of the game into the Odéon's leafy neighborhood -- while a few passers-by stopped, puzzled, to peek at the action onstage. In Siéfert's theater, the real and the virtual keep colliding in invigorating ways.

Once Soaring, Vice Media Now Faces Bankruptcy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Vice, which had wooed media giants, has struggled to adjust to the punishing realities of digital publishing. A group of creditors could buy Vice for $ 225 million.
Vice Media filed for bankruptcy on Monday, punctuating a yearslong descent from a new-media darling to a cautionary tale of the problems facing the digital publishing industry.
The bankruptcy will not interrupt daily operations for Vice's businesses, which in addition to its flagship website include the ad agency Virtue, the Pulse Films division and Refinery29, a women-focused site acquired by Vice in 2019.
A group of Vice's lenders, including Fortress Investment Group and Soros Fund Management, is in the leading position to acquire the company out of bankruptcy. The group has submitted a bid of $ 225 million, which would be covered by its existing loans to the company. It would also take over "significant liabilities" from Vice after any deal closes.
A sale process follows next. The lenders have secured a $ 20 million loan to continue operating Vice and then, if a better bid does not emerge, the group that includes Fortress and Soros will acquire Vice.
Still, the dreams that Vice executives once had of a stock market debut or a sale at an eye-popping valuation have been wiped away. The company was considered to be worth $ 5.7 billion at one point.
Investments from media titans like Disney and shrewd financial investors like TPG, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars, will be rendered worthless by the bankruptcy, cementing Vice's status among the most notable bad bets in the media industry.
Like some of its peers in the digital-media industry, including BuzzFeed and Vox Media, Vice and its investors bet big on the rising power of social media networks like Facebook and Instagram, anticipating they would deliver a tide of young, upwardly mobile readers that advertisers craved.
Though readers came by the millions, new media companies had trouble wringing profits from them, and the bulk of digital ad dollars went to the major tech platforms. Last month, BuzzFeed shut down its namesake Pulitzer Prize-winning news division after going public at a small fraction of its earlier valuation, and Vox Media earlier this year raised money at roughly half its 2015 valuation.
"There are definitely commonalities in the hardships media organizations have been facing and Vice is no exception," said S. Mitra Kalita, the founder and publisher of Epicenter-NYC, a community journalism company based in Queens. "We now know that a brand tethered to social media for its growth and audience alone is not sustainable."
Bankruptcy records filed Monday show that Vice is made up of a web of companies associated with its various businesses, including Pulse Films and Carrot Creative, an ad agency. The filings say Vice has outstanding debt of $ 834 million, dwarfing the amount Vice was recently in talks to sell for.
They also show Vice owes some of its biggest business partners millions of dollars. The company said it owed Wipro, an information technology firm, nearly $ 10 million. Justin Stefano, one of the co-founders of Refinery29, is owed more than $ 500,000, according to the filings. And Davis Wright Tremaine, a law firm that has represented Vice, has a claim of more than $ 300,000.
The bankruptcy filing will give the company some relief from its onerous debt load as its lenders, including Fortress, seek to salvage their investments. Vice Media raised a $ 250 million loan from Fortress and Soros Fund Management in 2019 as it struggled to make a profit. It has been in default on that loan for months.
"It's the lender coming in and saying, 'I'm done funding the losses -- if I'm going to fund the losses, I'm going to take control of the company,"' said Eric Snyder, chairman of bankruptcy at the law firm Wilk Auslander. "It's not unusual for the lender to come in and tell the debtor, the borrower, 'You're putting this into bankruptcy, you're going to make a motion to sell, we're going to put in a first bid."'
Fortress sees a continuing role at Vice for Shane Smith, the brash co-founder who became synonymous with the company's gonzo journalism from exotic locales and oversaw a boundary-pushing culture that was rife with allegations of sexual harassment, according to a person familiar with the matter. Hozefa Lokhandwala and Bruce Dixon, co-chief executives at Vice, will also stay on.
According to the terms of Vice's bankruptcy loan, the company has 55 days to complete a sale. In documents filed with the bankruptcy court, Vice said that the timeline to sale, "while tight," is necessary "to best position the company to survive as a going concern."
In a statement, Mr. Dixon and Mr. Lokhandwala said that the bankruptcy sale would ultimately "strengthen the company."
"We look forward to completing the sale process in the next two to three months and charting a healthy and successful next chapter at Vice."
The bankruptcy is a moment of humility for Vice, which a decade ago appeared destined to sell for an eye-watering sum or make its debut on the public markets. In the 2010s, Vice raised piles of money from traditional media companies, which it had assailed for growing complacent. The company sold advertisers and investors on its ability to reach young millennials who were hungry for an alternative to its corporate rivals, delivering you-are-there dispatches from North Korea and Liberia without the decorum of the mainstream news media.
But the harsh realities of digital publishing caught up with Vice, and things went sideways. In 2017, the company raised $ 400 million from the private equity firm TPG in a deal code-named "Project Venus" that valued the company at $ 5.7 billion. But the cash infusion saddled Vice with financial obligations if it didn't hit aggressive profitability targets, and it eventually became an albatross for the company. Later that year, The New York Times and other outlets published investigations into allegations of sexual harassment at the company, kicking off a crisis at Vice that shook confidence in its management.
Mr. Smith replaced himself as chief executive of the company, appointing Nancy Dubuc -- a longtime TV executive at A&E who shepherded hits like "Duck Dynasty" -- to oversee the sprawling Brooklyn-based media empire. Investors hoped Ms. Dubuc would sell the company or take it public, and she made repeated attempts.
The latest took place this winter, a sales process that drew interest from several potential suitors. Antenna Group, a Greek media company that has done business with Vice before, expressed interest in acquiring it, but a deal never materialized. Ms. Dubuc left in February, with no buyer in sight and without achieving her long-stated goal of consistently turning a profit at Vice.
The situation got worse last month. The company laid off employees after Antenna stopped making payments to Vice for a production deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The cuts included employees at Vice World News, the company's global reporting initiative, after it became clear those efforts were no longer financially viable.
Alex Detrick, a spokesman for Antenna and the former chief communications officer for Vice under Mr. Smith, declined to comment.
Ms. Kalita of Epicenter-NYC, who also co-founded URL Media -- a network of media outlets owned by Black and brown people that share content and advertising -- said Vice's bankruptcy was a reminder to founders to develop many different kinds of businesses beyond just advertising.
"I think even those of us running profitable media start-ups now," Ms. Kalita said, "are thinking more carefully about growth and making sure we can continuously define our audience and the value we represent to them."

The Pomp and Customization of Graduation Caps: [Style Desk]

Full text: Decorating mortarboards has long been a tradition. Graduates who would rather outsource the task can now hire designers to do it.
Maria Rubio wasn't sure she would graduate from Arizona State University after having a daughter when she was a sophomore.
"I was on the verge of dropping out," she said.
But Ms. Rubio, 22, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Mexico before she was born, said that becoming a mother in 2020 ultimately gave her the motivation to finish college. "More than ever, I wanted to graduate and do something for myself and my daughter," said Ms. Rubio, who lives in Phoenix.
At her graduation this month, Ms. Rubio plans to have her daughter in the audience -- and on her head, in the form of a custom portrait decorating Ms. Rubio's graduation cap. The portrait, which cost $ 120, features likenesses of Ms. Rubio and her daughter.
"It's the cherry on top of my accomplishment," Ms. Rubio said.
Decorating graduation caps has long been a tradition among graduates, many of whom do all the gluing, beading and glittering themselves or with friends. But those who would rather outsource the task can now hire a growing number of artisans to create elaborate artwork that is placed flat on top of a cap.
Kimberlee Morales, who made the portrait for Ms. Rubio's cap, said she has received order inquiries for graduations through 2034. She started customizing caps in 2016, when she was still in college. After a few that she had made for classmates drew attention on social media, strangers began requesting their own designs, she said. When Instagram later promoted her business, Kim's Custom Caps, it resulted in even more orders.
Ms. Morales, who works from a studio at her home in Norwalk, Calif., said she is making about 250 custom designs this year. Each one typically takes two to three hours to decorate. They start at $ 65, but pieces that require more detailed portraits can cost more than $ 100.
Ms. Morales also sells semi-custom styles (starting at $ 28), which can be personalized with quotes or photos, as well as premade designs (starting at $ 26).
Judith Dueñas, 24, who is pursuing a degree online from Thomas Edison University, ordered a custom piece from Ms. Morales for her graduation this winter. Ms. Dueñas, who lives in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., and works as an administrative assistant, said she and Ms. Morales spent days developing the design. It features a prosthetic leg, which Ms. Dueñas has had since childhood, as well as elements that nod to her Mexican heritage.
Ms. Dueñas said that when she saw the finished product, which cost $ 120, she "sobbed for a good 10 minutes."
Ms. Morales said that most of her clients who request custom designs are the children of immigrants or have immigrated to the United States themselves. Many, she added, "owe their journeys to their families, and they want to honor that."
Like Ms. Morales, Emiah Youman began customizing graduation caps when she was in college. Ms. Youman, who started selling them through her business, Custom Couture by Emiah, in 2019, now also offers premade styles (starting at $ 50), as well as hand-painted designs (starting at $ 210).
Ms. Youman, who lives in Washington, said she has received about 100 orders this year. Her custom designs can take up to three months to complete, in part because she is running her business while attending law school at Howard University. "It's just me doing everything," she said. But, she added, "to get videos and pictures of the families with the caps, it's just really special."
Marc Goldberg said he saw the potential for a cap-decorating business back in the late '90s, when his mother couldn't locate him among the throng of black-capped students at his college graduation. "I thought, 'There's got to be a way that you can stand out in the crowd,"' said Mr. Goldberg, who lives in Midland Park, N.J. Years later, in 2012, he started Tassel Toppers, which lets customers design mortarboards online.
Custom mortarboards from Tassel Toppers start at $ 25, in part because the company does not offer hand-painted styles; premade designs start at $ 15. Mr. Goldberg, who also owns a technology company, said this allows some orders to be shipped within 24 hours of being placed. The company, which employs five full-time assistant designers, can complete as many as 1,000 orders a day between April and June, Mr. Goldberg said.
Sarah Plazola, a part-time substitute teacher in Los Angeles who began making custom caps in 2017, said she received thousands of order inquiries in 2022. This year, Ms. Plazola said she has accepted some 260 orders for her custom designs, which start at $ 30. She also sells premade styles, starting at $ 25.
Ms. Plazola said that in the years since she started her business, Uncapped Creations, she has noticed that the field of cap decorators has become more crowded, and that more designs are starting to look alike. She once had to ask another maker to stop offering styles that borrowed too much from hers.
"I don't mind when other makers add their own personality and creativity to it," Ms. Plazola said. "But when it's a complete copy, I will not stay quiet."
Even though she has more competition, Ms. Plazola still has to turn customers down.
"There are so many graduates," she said. "I can't cater to all of them."

Full text: THE CHEF MOST often credited with inventing the croquembouche, the French-born confection that towers haughtily over any table it graces, was, unsurprisingly, an architecture enthusiast. Toward the end of the French Revolution, years before he baked the cake for Napoleon Bonaparte's (second) wedding, Marie-Antoine Carême began an apprenticeship at a patisserie near the Palais Royal. He'd spend his afternoons in the national library across the street, mesmerized by images of architectural marvels. "He copied in ink -- and then created in pastry and marzipan, in sugar paste and spun sugar -- the ruined castles and hermitages, temples, pyramids and fountains he had seen in the Bibliothèque," writes Ian Kelly in his 2003 biography of Carême, "Cooking for Kings."
Among Carême's most heroic specialties were his statuesque pastries, known as extraordinaires, some shaped as giant harps or colonnaded fountains. But it was the croquembouche in particular -- a conical tower typically rising several feet high and constructed out of cream puffs (a.k.a. choux à la crème) bound together with caramel -- that became a staple of French wedding banquets and, eventually, his legacy.
Its name translated as "crunch in the mouth," the pastry, when made properly, should deliver a gratifying crackle with every bite. Ensuring that crunch -- by preparing the dough just so, and serving before the caramel softens -- is in itself a feat, says Claire Saffitz, 36, the baker and food writer who included a recipe for croquembouche in her 2020 book, "Dessert Person," cautioning readers that it's an arduous undertaking. The outsize ambition required for a croquembouche may be why, along with its undeniable visual appeal, a crop of young pastry chefs are reviving the form. Over the years "it became a way of showing off my baking achievement," says Saffitz. "People sort of gasp and they're like, 'What is that?"'
Last spring, Zélikha Dinga, 33, a Parisian chef who runs the catering company Caro Diario, created a 2 1/2-foot-tall croquembouche after the Danish fashion brand Ganni requested "something spectacular" for a Paris dinner event. Dinga embellished her collection of cream puffs with a scattering of pale yellow and pink snapdragons, accompanying it with stalks of poached rhubarb and a mound of Chantilly cream. "To me, everything about the croquembouche is appealing," says Dinga, noting its unusual shape, its gleam and "the ceremony of serving it."
This means that the croquembouche is the ideal dessert for an era in which food is consumed first by the eyes. In December, the nonalcoholic spirits company Ghia held an event at the Los Angeles nightclub Los Candiles for which the main centerpiece was a 200-puff croquembouche pierced with sparklers. That same month at Nine Orchard, a new hotel on Manhattan's Lower East Side, the French fashion brand Hermès hosted a dinner where the New York-based artist Laila Gohar, 34, presented a savory spin on the croquembouche, replacing the puffs with brussels sprouts, purple potatoes and turnips. But then, at the end of the meal, the sweet version emerged, too -- laboriously constructed by Nine Orchard's executive director of food and beverage, Jason Pfeifer, 38, and doused with a pour of melted bittersweet chocolate. And in March, at the 95th Academy Awards Governors Ball after-party, guests came face to face with miniature chocolate Oscar statuettes perched on a croquembouche, its puffs filled with mango and passion fruit cream.
ANOTHER KEY PART of its allure: The croquembouche provokes childlike wonder, as well as childlike eating habits. It's sticky, gloriously so. The Paris-based baker Andrea Sham, 36, appreciates the hands-on aspect. "There's a contact thing with it; everyone's taking the choux," she says. "It's quite messy, but it's fun." When Sham was asked to create a croquembouche for a 2022 wedding, she mixed charcoal powder with the caramel to give some of the puffs a patent leather shine, while she turned others white with a thin layer of fondant, then tucked peach-colored chrysanthemums in between orbs.
But though it may inspire messiness, the simplest croquembouche takes precision. For starters, one must perfect the dough for the choux, which is often topped with craquelin, a thin layer of cookielike dough that adds crunch and a buttery flavor. Then comes the assiduously whipped pastry cream that fills the choux. Finally, there's the caramel that not only glues the choux together but gives it all a pleasing sheen. Some bakers use a conical mold to ensure a perfect shape. Others prefer a more artisanal approach. When Julia Child made croquembouche with Martha Stewart, Child constructed hers "country-style," as Stewart put it, in more of a pile than a hollow building. Saffitz prefers an organic, coneless construction and, despite the seeming fragility of the form, notes that one of her foot-high croquembouches fared fine on a hundred-block New York City taxi trip.
So why, of Carême's many intricate extraordinaires, has the croquembouche persisted when the others remain locked in the culinary archives? One theory: It offers satisfaction from beginning (the cook marveling at her own accomplishment) to end. Much of Carême's elaborate centerpieces, with their hardened dough and excess of spun sugar, were never intended for consumption; they were as flavorful as cardboard and often reused at multiple banquets. By contrast, a tower of choux is meant to be enjoyed within an evening, shortly after the puffs have been piped. Yes, its grandeur can be preserved on Instagram, but the real delight of it is purely present tense.

Full text: Rohit Kalkur proposed to Stephanie Korbely with a 28-page scrapbook consisting of photo memories and love notes. Their wedding took place at an event focused on ending child marriages.
During one of New York's rainiest weekends, Ladies Pavilion, an ornate cast-iron gazebo in Central Park off West 77th Street, kept Rohit Subramanya Kalkur and Stephanie Janina Korbely sheltered at the time of their wedding ceremony on April 30.
They struggled a bit to slip rings onto each other's fingers because of the humidity from the storm. But the splattering of the rain actually served as a pleasant soundtrack for the ceremony. The city's skyscrapers, shrouded in mist, made for a romantic backdrop. The Central Park Lake, and a beautiful pink tree that popped out among the greenery, only added to the picture.
That's why the couple did not mind skipping over the puddles down the path to the pavilion. It was a distinctly New York City wedding ceremony for a New York City love story.
That morning, Mr. Kalkur made himself and Ms. Korbely cups of hot chai with freshly grated ginger, a pinch of turmeric and cardamom. Mr. Kalkur's morning chai -- "the best," according to Ms. Korbely -- has been a daily ritual for the couple since they started dating.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, they matched on the dating app Hinge in July 2020 and had their first date a few weeks later over a video call. The next week, they met in Prospect Park for a "socially distance walk and talk," Mr. Kalkur, 34, said. They had takeout drinks from the bar Washington Commons and watched the sun set and the fireflies fluttering in the night sky. "It felt very magical," Ms. Korbely, 36, said.
"With New York dating, you never really know how serious it is and where things are going to go," she said. But she had a good feeling about Mr. Kalkur, and so did he about her.
"We quickly became a pandemic pod," she said. They spent a lot of time in his apartment working remotely, cooking together and watching movies.
In May 2021, they moved in together to a one-bedroom apartment in Downtown Brooklyn in the same building he had been living in. (He had previously been in a studio.) Mr. Kalkur is from Colorado Springs, and Ms. Korbely is from Bavaria, Germany.
For the proposal, Mr. Kalkur put together a 28-page scrapbook filled with photos from their travel adventures, road trips and fun times with friends. He added her photo from Hinge that he had swiped right on, a collection of dishes they cooked together during the pandemic and love notes that she had left him whenever she went away on trips. He even collected Post-it Notes she had left around their apartment as little reminders, including one she had put on their rice cooker that says: "Add oil!" ("He always forgets to do it," she said.)
He also wrote messages throughout the book. One said: "Little did I know that on the day I swiped on your profile, my life would change forever."
He presented the scrapbook to her on Christmas morning in 2022.
"Stephanie always used to joke around that she didn't want a corny holiday proposal," Mr. Kalkur said. "I'm like, 'Well, you're going to get one."'
On the last page, there was a plastic bag with a ring inside, "a suspicious bulge" that she had been ignoring the whole time, she said.
He took the ring out and went down on one knee in his set of their matching Christmas pajamas. "I was crying the whole time already," Ms. Korbely said. (Mr. Kalkur recalled that she had responded with an "of course," but she doesn't remember.)
Mr. Kalkur works as a software engineer at the financial technology company Robinhood and graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Ms. Korbely is a program manager at Stripe, also a financial technology company, who graduated from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich with a bachelor's and master's degree in communication science. Both work from New York offices.

Their wedding ceremony was part of an event called Elopements for Couples Who Care, hosted by Have Lover, Will Travel, a wedding officiating company, and the nonprofit Vow for Girls, which is focused on ending child marriages globally. According to the group, "every three seconds, a girl is forced into marriage against her will."
Couples chose from one of two donation tiers for their elopements. Mr. Kalkur and Ms. Korbely selected the tier 2 package, which cost $ 611 and "pays for small business start-up costs and vocational training for one girl," a representative for Vow for Girls wrote in an email. The package included a ceremony, five photographs and the signing and filing of the license. Liz Norment, the founder of Have Lover, Will Travel, officiated in front of 10 guests. She is ordained through the Universal Life Church.
Ms. Korbely found out about the elopement event on Instagram about a week before it happened. The couple wanted the legal marriage officiated ahead of a Hindu wedding ceremony with family in Munich on July 1.
"It's just really special if we can give this day a bigger meaning, a meaning that's bigger than us," Ms. Korbely said.
It was also special for them to have the ceremony in New York, the home of their love story. They bonded over their love for the "resiliency of New York City," Mr. Kalkur said, having had lots of takeout drinks and bicycle rides together during the pandemic.
"We couldn't tell our story without New York."

As the Beaches of Malibu Beckon, Rosie O'Donnell Lists Her Manhattan Penthouse: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The duplex apartment on East 49th Street is on the market for $ 8.3 million, slightly above what the comedian and actor paid for it six years ago.
Rosie O'Donnell is bidding farewell to New York City, at least for the time being.
The comedian, actress and serial real estate buyer has decided to sell her last remaining Manhattan property: a sprawling penthouse in the Turtle Bay neighborhood with an immense rooftop terrace and stunning East River vistas.
Ms. O'Donnell, 61, who was raised on Long Island, recently relocated to the West Coast with her youngest daughter, Dakota, 10. She bought a modern farmhouse for $ 4.6 million in the Beverlywood neighborhood of Los Angeles in late 2021, though only four months later sold it for a small profit. She is now renting a beachfront home in Malibu, reportedly near the actor Fran Drescher.
The Turtle Bay apartment, one of two penthouses in the Sterling Plaza condominium, at 255 East 49th Street near Second Avenue, is on the market for $ 8.3 million, according to the listing broker, Paul Anand of Brown Harris Stevens. Monthly common charges are $ 4,784. Ms. O'Donnell paid $ 8 million in 2017 for the unit, which had served as her primary residence.
The nearly 3,600-square-foot apartment, on the red brick tower's top two floors, has four bedrooms and three full bathrooms, plus a 1,620-square-foot terrace on the roof, where there is also an enclosed 120-square-foot pantry and kitchenette. (Mr. Anand says the penthouse is being marketed as a duplex, not a triplex, despite this extra room.)
"The crown jewel of the property is the terrace, with its 360-degree views of Manhattan's Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building and East River," Mr. Anand said. "It's like a private oasis. And it's what sold Rosie on the apartment."
Ms. O'Donnell also appreciated the top-to-bottom renovations undertaken by the previous owners, he said, as well as its high-end finishes, like the imported Russian wide-plank oak floors, marble bathrooms and Boffi kitchen. Sound and lighting systems were also installed.
"It was turnkey condition," Mr. Anand said, "and the new owners won't have to do anything to it, either."
The main level of the home is on the top 33rd floor. A small entryway leads to a great room, where there is a living room area with a honed black granite wood-burning fireplace and a formal dining area with cozy window seats and an onyx-clad wet bar with a wine refrigerator and a sink. Centrally located is a sculptured, curvy staircase.
"It's perfect for entertaining," Mr. Anand said of the layout, "and you can take your guests up the stairs to the terrace."
At the opposite end of the floor is a large eat-in kitchen. "You get two of every top-of-the-line appliance," Mr. Anand said, noting the Gaggenau refrigerators, including one for wine, and the Miele ovens and dishwashers. There is also a 33-foot-long center island/breakfast bar, Corian countertops and an integrated espresso and cappuccino maker.
Near the kitchen is a bedroom and bathroom.
The primary bedroom suite, measuring 14.5-by-20 feet, is down a separate hallway near the entrance to the apartment. It has a wall of closets and an en suite bathroom with a steam shower and soaking tub.
On the floor below is another bathroom, a sauna and two more bedrooms, one of which comes with a walk-in closet and a balcony.
The rooftop terrace has areas carved out for dining and lounging.
Ms. O'Donnell, a former host of "The View," more recently starred in the Showtime drama series "American Gigolo," which was filmed in the Los Angeles area. Over the years, she has bought and sold numerous properties up and down the Eastern Seaboard. These have included homes in Greenwich, Conn.; Saddle River, N.J.; Nyack, N.Y.; Miami Beach; and West Palm Beach, Fla. (The West Palm house was just six miles away from former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Ms. O'Donnell and Mr. Trump have famously feuded for years.)
Her transactions in Manhattan have included the 2014 sale of another duplex penthouse, at 130 West 12th Street in Greenwich Village, and last year a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment at 350 West 53rd Street in Hell's Kitchen, which she had used as a pied-à-terre.
Judging by her frequent Instagram and TikTok posts, it looks like Ms. O'Donnell's next real estate purchase might be in Malibu.
"I gotta say, I love it here so much," she recently told her followers, showing off the direct ocean views and picturesque sunsets from her balcony. "It's beautiful here. It really is."

Full text: Arthur Dove
Through May 25. Alexandre, 25 East 73rd Street, Manhattan; 212-755-2828, alexandregallery.com.
The unmissable first full survey in a quarter century of the great American modernist painter Arthur Dove (1880--1946) is a swoony, museum-weight exhibition compressed into an Upper East Side gallery the size of a one-bedroom apartment. With 40 works, more than half of them paintings, all on loan from private collections, the show deftly sketches Dove's leaping, jolting career trajectory from Manhattan magazine illustrator, to Paris Impressionist, to fully abstract painter, some say the first such in the United States.
What he was for sure was American Modernism's great visual Transcendentalist. His images of molten rain clouds and God's-eye sunrises are views of the natural world as Thoreau might have seen and, more important, felt it. Dove always said that the meteorology -- the "sensation of light" -- he painted was a personal, intuitive one. And only somewhat more objective were his depictions of forces he saw as threats to that light: images of derricks, freight cars and cinder barges that evoked a spreading plague of industry and pollution.
Dove's art, despite its exultations, is tough and complex, as is clear at a glance through the splendid catalogue raisonné by Debra Bricker Balken. And although his reputation grew steadily in the New York art world, that world wasn't the one he really cared about. For years he lived in a sailboat moored on Long Island. And he spent his last years in a converted one-room former post office, a space probably not much different in size from that in which this gallery survey, one of the best of the season, is installed.

'Kanten 観展: The Limits of History'
Through May 20. Apexart, 291 Church Street, Manhattan; 212-431-5270, apexart.org.
Beginning in the late 19th century, Japan amassed an empire that extended far beyond its contemporary borders. It was dismantled after the country's surrender in World War II -- but just because something is over doesn't mean it's forgotten. The exhibition "Kanten 観展: The Limits of History," curated by Eimi Tagore-Erwin, uses the work of eight artists and historical propaganda postcards to trace the scars left by imperial Japan.
In his photo series "Torii," Motoyuki Shitamichi documents Shinto gates that were once installed to mark the empire and now stand in other countries. The pictures show how the gates have been incorporated into their surroundings, becoming mundane but haunting remnants of the past.
Bontaro Dokuyama demonstrates how nationalist legacies live on in people. His video "My Anthem" (2019) features interviews with Taiwanese elders who can still recall the militaristic songs they had to memorize as children in a school choir. Scenes of them wearing uniforms and singing are both funny and sad.
My favorite piece, "Making a Perfect Donut" (2019), leans into humor as a tool for repair. The video features the duo Kyun-Chome trying to bridge the gap between Japanese locals and U.S. military personnel on Okinawa Island. They do so by enlisting people to make Japanese and American doughnuts on either side of a military fence and then put the two together: The small, roundish Japanese doughnut sort of fits, imperfectly, into the American one's hole. Their absurd quest becomes a metaphor for finding human-scale ways to navigate geopolitical complexity. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Pentti Monkkonen
Through May 18. Jenny's, 9 Pell Street, Manhattan; 646-861-1581, jennys.us.
It's been over a decade since New York has seen one of the grand, hyperrealist installations constructed by artists like Mike Nelson, Christoph Büchel, Gregor Schneider or Justin Lowe and Jonah Freeman. These large, psychedelic fun-house affairs functioned like surrealistic movie sets, à la Luis Buñuel or David Lynch, and came with warnings and waivers that visitors had to sign. The Minneapolis-born artist Pentti Monkkonen has created a much smaller but effectively unsettling environment with his new show, "Oscillator."
The setting is a wood-paneled office -- but things are off at the office. The shelving units radiate an icy glow; a giant moth sculpted in epoxy hangs on one wall; an enlarged vintage Visa card, issued to King Kong, on another. Embedded in the fourth wall is an old desktop computer outfitted with a synthesizer that visitors can play, creating their own retro-futuristic soundtrack. "Oscillator" mimics not so much the contemporary minimal office cubicle as a hallucinogenic rendition of a '70s Sidney Lumet movie involving contraband and hostages.
The overall medium here is nostalgia. Some appurtenances are outdated while others, like King Kong, have morphed over decades from movie monster to furry folk hero. The art world is similarly nostalgic: It used to embrace (and fund) epic installations; now we're stuck with immersive Van Gogh or Hieronymus Bosch "experiences" and art fairs. In this sense, "Oscillator" serves almost like a mnemonic device, reminding us not only of pop culture past, but lost art worlds. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Marcelo Pombo
Through May 21.‌ ‌ Barro‌, 25 Peck Slip, Manhattan; 646-642-2625, barro.cc‌‌
The Argentine artist Marcelo Pombo is deviant in the best way: He depicts human sexuality as acts of speculation and ingenuity. Barro gallery's "Artisanal Conceptualism: Starting Point" offers the 1980s and '90s work of Pombo, who had fled the Argentine dictatorship for Brazil to avoid conscription in the Falklands War. This is half of the two-part exhibition -- Pombo's "Dibujos de San Pablo" ("The São Paulo Drawings") made in 1982 -- portraying human figures with bird bills or snouts like mice, or sex organs in the place of heads. These figures are engaged in all manner of gazing and wanton bodily exploration. It's utterly refreshing to see sexual relations as pansexual instead of expectedly heteronormative, or even rigidly homosexual. Using animal figures as surrogates, Pombo makes two human-bird hybrid creatures with wet beaks fondling each other ("Untitled 1982") intensely erotic, and curious.
Simultaneously Pombo uses this vocabulary of surrealism to make the terror of that time palpable. He draws a bird-man bleeding in a street from what are likely two bullet wounds, a dog and two witnesses weeping for this loss.
The other half contains everyday objects such as curtains and mosquito nets decorated as if Pombo insisted on recognizing that beauty often holds hands with tragedy. And his drawings of textiles, for example, the one with the knitting needles, "(1) ST," is so realistic I want to touch the paper. And that is the key to this work: the desire to touch and to come to know by touching. SEPH RODNEY
Harris Rosenblum
Through May 20, Sara's, 2 East Broadway, third floor, Manhattan; saras.world.
What do preppers, gamers and religionists have in common? Not least, a taste for magical objects. With "Inorganic Demons," the Massachusetts-based artist Harris Rosenblum draws out the overlapping aesthetics of several contemporary subcultures, from primitive survivalists on Instagram to practitioners of the tabletop role-playing game "Warhammer." Laughably big, lumpy anime swords hang from the rafters; thus arrayed, the gallery, an unfinished loft in Chinatown, has the air of a LARPer's treasure room. Weaponry and relics include "Mourning Bracelet (For Hatsune)," 2022, a thin braid of cyan fibers from a manga cosplay wig; and "Knife," a World War II-style blade delicately displayed in a case lined with pink camouflage satin.
These are the accessories of subcultures that, maybe more than most, rely on fantasy. Several sculptures take the form of biblical paraphernalia. There's "The Sacrificial Lamb," a hollow statue patched together from disturbing, spongelike chunks of resin; and "Censer (Mechanical Squonk Mod)" made from PC parts and vaping components -- a peek into the sympathetic cults of customizable smoking and gaming gear. Rosenblum dedicates special attention to materials, the way a splinter of wood or bone proves the lives of the saints. Today, the rites of devout nerds involve PCs and fast internet, nicotine and fast food. In "Earth and New Earth Miku," one Hatsune figurine is 3-D printed, another made of clay from a Wendy's construction site. It takes some imagination to see past the crudeness of the objects to the magnificence of the beliefs they anchor. TRAVIS DIEHL

The Harmony of the Seas cruise ship, one of the biggest in the world, with its multiple-deck water slides, zip line and surf simulators, is a favorite among families. But the discovery of a hidden camera in a public bathroom during a recent sailing has many passengers questioning their enthusiasm after the F.B.I. said that minors who appear to be as young as 4 or 5 years old had fallen victim to video voyeurism onboard.
According to an F.B.I. affidavit in support of the criminal complaint and arrest warrant, on April 30, a day after the Royal Caribbean ship departed from Miami for a seven-night eastern Caribbean cruise, a man identified as Jeremy Froias allegedly hid a Wi-Fi camera in a top deck bathroom, pointing its lens toward the toilet. The bathroom was located close to one of the ship's surf simulators and many passengers used it to change into their swimsuits.
A day later, the camera was spotted by a passenger who reported it to the ship's security staff. They found hours' worth of footage showing more than 150 people, including what appear to be at least 40 minors -- some of whom were at least partly naked, the charging document said.
The ship stopped in Puerto Rico, where the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Froias and charged him with video voyeurism and attempted possession of child exploitation material.
"Individuals are seen coming into the bathroom to either use the toilet or to change into or out of swimsuits," the affidavit says. "Froias's camera captured these individuals in various stages of undress, including capturing videos of their naked genitals, buttocks and female breasts."
Mr. Froias is a former cybersecurity officer for the Central Florida city of Kissimmee. Footage retrieved from the camera shows Mr. Froias installing the device, the affidavit said. During an interview with the cruise ship security personnel on May 1, he admitted to placing the camera in the bathroom, according to court documents.
Leo Aldridge, a San Juan-based lawyer representing Mr. Froias, declined to answer questions about the case. "Mr. Froias has not been indicted at this time. Therefore, because no criminal charges have been formally filed at this juncture, we have no comments," he said in a written statement.
The F.B.I. did not return a request for comment.
Mr. Froias appeared for a detention hearing in Puerto Rico this week, and a federal judge ordered his release on the condition that he pay a $ 25,000 bond, wear an electronic monitoring device and surrender his passport. He is not allowed to access the internet or have unsupervised contact with minors under the age of 18, including his two children.
Jim Walker, a Miami-based maritime lawyer who has represented victims in other voyeurism cases, questioned the amount of the bond. "A $ 25,000 bond might be appropriate for a single victim, but considering there are at least 150 victims and many dozens of children, according to the F.B.I. affidavit, a bond should not be less than $ 1,000,000," he said. He said he has been contacted by passengers who were on the Harmony of the Seas during the incident.
Passengers said Royal Caribbean had failed to notify them about the hidden camera during and after the sailing. They said they found out through the media and an F.B.I. notice seeking to identify potential victims.
"It's terrifying that passengers and their children were filmed secretly while they were naked using the bathroom," said April Wise, 52, who was on the cruise with her husband and niece. "Thankfully, we didn't use that bathroom, but thousands of people were on the ship and they still don't know if they were filmed or not. It's unacceptable that Royal Caribbean has not contacted the victims."
Royal Caribbean declined to comment, but emailed a statement, saying: "We are aware of an incident that occurred on board Harmony of the Seas' April 29 cruise. The matter was immediately reported to local and federal law enforcement and the guest involved was removed from the ship by authorities for further investigation. As this is an active case, we are unable to share any more details at this time."
It is not the first time that such an incident has occurred on a cruise ship. In March, an MSC Cruises crew member was caught filming women in a restroom. In 2017, a family found a hidden camera pointing toward their bed in their stateroom on board the Carnival Fantasy, but after conducting an investigation the cruise company said the camera had not been operational.
"It's so easy for predators to buy small cheap cameras these days," Ms. Wise said. "Checking for them needs to be part of cruise ship security protocol."

Rita Lee, 75, Brazil's Queen of Rock: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a member the 1960s band Os Mutantes and later as a solo artist, she drew a following that included Kurt Cobain, Beck and the Prince of Wales.
Rita Lee, a convention-flouting titan of Brazilian music who emerged with the seminal experimental band Os Mutantes and went on to become a solo star known widely as her country's Queen of Rock, died on Monday at her home in São Paulo. She was 75.
Her death was announced in a statement posted on her Instagram account. She had been receiving treatments for lung cancer, which she learned she had in 2021.
With Os Mutantes, Ms. Lee was a product of the tropicália movement (also known as tropicalismo), an anti-authoritarian Brazilian cultural flowering that started in the late 1960s. She ultimately became a commercial powerhouse, selling a reported 55 million records over a career that stretched over half a century.
As a solo artist, she churned out a string of hits in the 1970s, among then "Ovelha Negra" ("Black Sheep") and "Mania de Você" ("Mania For You"), that became enduring classics. She was accompanied by the band Tutti Frutti in her early years, and later, by her husband, Roberto de Carvalho.
In 2001, Ms. Lee took home a Latin Grammy Award for best Portuguese-language rock or alternative album for "3001."
Her reach was global. Kurt Cobain, David Byrne and Beck are among the many musical innovators who hailed the subversive oeuvre of Os Mutantes. In 1988, King Charles III, then the Prince of Wales, requested one of her records for a dance at a banquet at the British Embassy in Paris. He was said to know the words "by heart," according to The Daily Mirror.
But she was no pop confection. After a troubled and rebellious youth, she was arrested in 1976 for marijuana possession and held up as a cautionary tale by Brazil's military dictatorship. She also made multiple trips to treatment facilities for drug and alcohol use.
Irreverent and candid, Ms. Lee carried herself with rock-star swagger. (After her cancer diagnosis, the mordant Ms. Lee nicknamed her tumor Jair, a jab at Brazil's incendiary president at the time, Jair Bolsonaro.)
As one of the few female rockers to play guitar onstage in the 1960s, and as a solo artist who explored sexuality from a woman's point of view, Ms. Lee was hailed as a feminist hero. When informed of Ms. Lee's death during a Senate commission hearing, Brazil's cultural minister, the singer Margareth Menezes, was visibly overcome with emotion, describing Ms. Lee as a "revolutionary woman."
Ms. Lee herself was a little more blunt about her triumphs.
"When we talk about feminism and all these things, I don't really have the theory of it, I'm more of the action," Ms. Lee said in a 2017 television interview. "They used to say that women couldn't wear long pants. Huh? Yes, we can, I wore mine. They used to say that women couldn't play rock. I would get my ovaries, my uterus, I'd play my rock 'n' roll."
Rita Lee Jones was born on Dec. 31, 1947, in São Paulo, the youngest of three daughters of Charles Jones, a dentist descended from Confederates who fled to Brazil after the Civil War (Rita's middle name was inspired by Gen. Robert E. Lee), and Romilda Padula, a pianist.
When she was a child, Ms. Lee recounted in "Rita Lee: Uma Autobiografia" (2016), a sewing machine repairman sexually abused her in her home, a traumatic experience that fueled her rebellious spirt. .
Musically inclined, she played in several groups as a teenager and, despite her early stage fright, formed Os Mutantes (the Mutants) with the brothers Arnaldo and Sérgio Dias Baptista in 1966. In an early interview, she claimed that the band, whose name was inspired by a science fiction book called "O Planeta dos Mutantes" ("The Planet of the Mutants"), had "come from another planet to take over the world."
The band was to São Paulo "what the Grateful Dead were to San Francisco, the Velvet Underground to New York or Nirvana to Seattle," Larry Rohter of The New York Times wrote during a comeback tour in 2007.
In terms of psychedelic trappings and extravagant plumage, the band was far more Dead than Velvets, although it took the free-for-all spirit of the '60s to absurdist levels, mixing American and British psychedelia with Brazilian genres like bossa nova, and adding electronic experimentalism and a prankster sensibility that served as a pointed rebuke to Brazil's authoritarian climate.
Os Mutantes made their mark backing Gilberto Gil at the Festival of Brazilian Popular Music in 1967. The next year the band appeared on the groundbreaking compilation album "Tropicália: Ou Panis et Circenses," featuring songs by Mr. Gil, Caetano Veloso and other leading lights of the movement.
The band's debut album, released that same year, was sprinkled with environmental sounds, jagged guitar riffs. and other sonic detritus. It was, Rolling Stone wrote when including it in a 2013 roundup of the greatest stoner albums of all time, one of the late 1960s' "most mischievous head trips, which is saying something."
Ms. Lee left the band to pursue a solo career after it released its fifth album, "Mutantes e Seus Cometas no País do Baurets" ("Mutants and their Comets in the Country of Weed"), in 1972. She retreated from the limelight after her final studio effort, "Reza" ("Prayer"), in 2012, although she did release a new song, "Change," with her husband and the producer Gui Boratto in 2021.
She is survived by her husband; her sons, Beto, João and Antônio; and two grandchildren. Her first marriage, to Arnaldo Baptista of Os Mutantes, ended in divorce in 1972.
A vegan and animal rights activist, the onetime countercultural firebrand spent much of her final years "confined to my den, in a little house in the middle of the woods surrounded by animals and plants," only going out shopping or to the dentist, she wrote in a 2020 essay for the Brazilian magazine Veja.
"Today," she added, "I do everything over the internet and pray I don't break a tooth."

New Plan Would Compensate Travelers for Delayed Flights: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If a proposed federal rule takes effect, airlines will have to pay passengers for meals, hotels, ground transportation and lost time if the disruption was caused by the carrier.
Technological failures, system outages and staffing shortages have caused thousands of flight delays and cancellations in recent months, wreaking havoc for travelers across the country and putting a spotlight on transportation officials. According to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, around 20 percent of flights were delayed last year. While the weather is often to blame, airlines are also frequently at fault.
President Biden and the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, announced a proposed new rule on Monday to compensate passengers affected by carrier-caused slowdowns. Under the proposal, airlines would be required to cover certain expenses for passengers as well as pay them for the inconvenience of flight delays and cancellations.
"I know how frustrated many of you are with the service you get from your U.S. airlines," Mr. Biden said during the announcement at the White House. "Your time matters. The impact on your life matters."
What would the change mean for travelers?
Under the new rule, carriers would have to provide passengers with assistance and monetary compensation when the airlines are at fault for cancellations or delays of three hours or more. Beyond free rebooking or refunding the price of the ticket, airlines would have to cover other costs incurred by travelers, such as hotels, meals and ground transportation. Additionally, inconvenienced fliers would be entitled to a payment in the form of cash, miles or travel vouchers.
"When an airline causes a flight cancellation or delay, passengers should not foot the bill," Mr. Buttigieg said in a statement. The rule would also define "controllable cancellation and delay," making it harder for airlines to deflect responsibility.
The Department of Transportation is still working out the specifics of how much travelers will be able to expect to be paid for their lost time or how claims will be handled, a spokesperson said in an email.
How is this different from what airlines already offer?
Since last year, most U.S. air carriers have committed to some type of compensation for passengers affected by controllable cancellations and significant delays. All 10 major carriers rebook passengers on the same airline at no additional cost, provide meals or meal vouchers when passengers are left waiting for three hours or more, and -- with the exception of Frontier Airlines -- furnish complimentary ground transportation and lodging in the case of overnight cancellations away from home.
Yet only two carriers offer customers any kind of compensation for the inconvenience.
Alaska Airlines provides discounts on future flights for delays of more than three hours if they were caused by the carrier. According to the airline's online policy, affected passengers will receive instructions from Alaska's airport personnel and an email or letter detailing the amount of the discount.
JetBlue Airways automatically notifies passengers via email if their flight qualifies for compensation and offers travel credit on a sliding scale up to $ 250, depending on the length of the delay and whether the plane had already boarded.
No major U.S. airlines currently provide cash compensation for disrupted flights.
Is there precedent for this type of rule?
In the European Union, where a similar regulation has been in place since 2004, flight cancellations or lengthy delays may give passengers the right to either a refund or a replacement flight, unless caused by "extraordinary circumstances" like severe weather or political unrest. The rule covers all passengers, regardless of nationality, and routes originating within the European Union -- even on U.S. carriers. On flights into E.U. countries, the rule applies only to E.U. carriers.
If flights take off late or are canceled less than 14 days before their scheduled departure, passengers may be entitled to up to 600 euros, or about $ 660. Passengers may also receive compensation if they're denied boarding. Claims can be filed with air carriers directly or through an online service like Flightright by providing details about the booking and the cause of the delay or cancellation.
If a flight is delayed overnight, passengers in the European Union may also be entitled to reimbursement for expenses like food, ground transportation and accommodation.
In introducing his proposal, Mr. Biden pointed to research showing that the E.U. policy had made a positive impact on air traffic there. A recent study in the journal Transport Policy concluded that European consumer rights regulations had improved service quality by cutting departure delays and boosting airlines' on-time performance.
When would the policy take effect?
No one knows for sure, but it isn't likely to be anytime soon.
Mr. Biden said he hoped the Department of Transportation would "move as quickly as it can to put this new rule in place," but did not specify a timeline.
The agency is currently working on the official document to announce and explain the proposed new rule. Once that is issued, there will be at least one public comment period, which can last several months and during which there may be public hearings, in person or online. Other agencies might also get involved at later stages of the review and analysis process. The rule could still evolve, or in rare cases, even be scrapped.
For now, passengers can keep track of airline compensation policies at FlightRights.gov.

James's Son Commits to U.S.C. in a First for His Family: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The Lakers star LeBron James, 38, has made it clear that he intends to team up with his son in the N.B.A. someday.
LeBron James's immediate goal is to win another N.B.A. championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. But longer term, he wants to play in the league with his older son, LeBron Jr., who goes by Bronny, beginning in 2024.
"I need to be on the floor with my boy," James told ESPN in January, recalling a situation from his childhood in which Ken Griffey and his son, Ken Griffey Jr., played for the Seattle Mariners. "I got to be on the floor with Bronny."
Bronny James, a 6-foot-3 guard, kept that goal on track Saturday by verbally committing to playing college basketball next season at the University of Southern California. He was seated at courtside Saturday night as the Lakers took a 2-1 lead in their Western Conference semifinal series with the Golden State Warriors.
"First of all, congratulations to my son on his next journey and picking a great university in U.S.C.," LeBron James said after posting 21 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists as the Lakers won Game 3, 127-97, in Los Angeles. "I'm proud of him. This is an incredible thing."
LeBron James added that he believed Bronny would be the first member of his family, the "first one out of the James gang," to attend college.
Bronny James made his announcement on Instagram, where he has more than seven million followers. His account had a picture of him standing in the Southern California locker room along with the caption "Fight On #committed." U.S.C. is sponsored by Nike, which has invested heavily in his father since he entered the N.B.A. as a generational phenom in 2003.
At U.S.C., Bronny James plans to join a Sierra Canyon classmate, Juju Watkins, the top-rated girls' prospect in the senior class. Both players have endorsement deals with Nike, and Bronny James also has one with Beats by Dre.
Memphis and Ohio State, the school LeBron has said he would have attended had he gone to college instead of going straight to the N.B.A. from high school as the No. 1 overall pick, were among the other universities linked to Bronny James. He visited Ohio State with his father in September, and fans at the football game that weekend chanted, "We want Bronny."
Bronny James had less fanfare as a prospect than his father did (of course, few high school players get the treatment LeBron James had). He is ranked as a four-star prospect by the recruiting site 247Sports, which rates him as the No. 26 prospect in the senior class.
He won't be the highest-ranked recruit for U.S.C. That honor belongs to Isaiah Collier, a five-star prospect from Marietta, Ga., who is rated as the No. 1 point guard in the class.
Still, Collier was busy recruiting Bronny James during the recent showcase circuit.
"'Stay home,' that's my pitch," Collier told reporters at the Nike Hoop Summit last month in Portland, Ore., where both players competed. "Why leave L.A.?"
The book so far on Bronny James is that he has a keen basketball I.Q. and an improved jump shot, but that he lacks elite athleticism. He averaged 14 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.8 steals per game last season at Sierra Canyon, but was a second-team all-league selection.
"He's solid," said Thaddeus Young, who finished his 16th N.B.A. season and sponsored a grass-roots team that competed against James at last summer's Nike Peach Jam. His assessment was largely echoed by college coaches and N.B.A. scouts. "Obviously, probably not the elite of the elite. But he's athletic, he's strong, he plays defense, he can shoot the ball well, he can run the point guard position, he can play off ball," he said.
Still, some colleges were wary of recruiting Bronny James. There were multiple factors in play for any coach that considered taking him. What happens if he doesn't play well enough to merit significant playing time? What if the team does well but he struggles? What if the team doesn't do well at all? How will security and locker room access be handled when LeBron James and his wife, Savannah, attend games? Considering Bronny has significant potential for individual endorsement deals, will there be added pressure to play him?
Bronny James, who turns 19 in October, is widely expected to spend one season in college before entering the N.B.A. draft in 2024, when his father will turn 40. Under the league's current rules, players cannot enter the draft until they are 19 and one year removed from their high school graduation class. That rule was renewed in a recent collective bargaining agreement between the N.B.A. players' union and team owners, despite some campaigning in college sports for athletes to be able to turn pro right out of high school.
LeBron James was asked on Saturday if it remained his goal to play alongside his son.
"We're going to support him whatever he decides to do," he said. "Because that's my aspiration and my goal doesn't mean it's his. And I'm absolutely OK with that. My job is to support my son, whatever he wants to do."
Bronny James is projected as an N.B.A. lottery pick by some draft experts. The Lakers, however, do not have a first-round pick in 2024, and LeBron has a player option for the 2024-25 season.
That all makes it unclear how Bronny James can end up on the same team as his famous father.

Ire Over Twitter Letting Images Spread Online: [National Desk]

Full text: Graphic images of the attack went viral on the platform, which has made cuts to its moderation team. Some users said the images exposed the realities of gun violence.
Pat Holloway has seen her share of destruction during a 30-year career as a photojournalist: the 1993 standoff in Waco, Texas; the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh; and the 2011 tornado that struck Joplin, Mo.
But this weekend, she said in an interview, she had had enough. When graphic images began circulating on Twitter showing bloody victims of a mass shooting at a mall in Texas that left at least nine people, including the gunman, dead, she tweeted at Elon Musk, Twitter's owner, demanding that he do something.
"This family does not deserve to see the dead relatives spread across Twitter for everybody to see," Ms. Holloway, 64, said in the interview on Sunday.
Ms. Holloway was one of many Twitter users who criticized the social network for allowing the grisly images -- including of a blood-spattered child -- to spread virally across the platform after the shooting on Saturday. Though gruesome images have become common on social media, where a cellphone camera and an internet connection make everyone a publisher, the unusually graphic nature of the images drew sustained outcry from users. And they threw a harsh spotlight on Twitter's content moderation practices, which have been curtailed since Mr. Musk acquired the company last year.
Like other social media companies, Twitter has once again found itself in a position akin to that of traditional newspaper editors, who wrestle with difficult decisions about how much to show their audiences. Though newspapers and magazines generally spare their readers from truly graphic images, they have made some exceptions, as Jet magazine did in 1955 when it published open-casket images of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy who was beaten to death in Mississippi, to illustrate the horrors of the Jim Crow-era South.
Unlike newspaper and magazine publishers, however, tech companies like Twitter must enforce their decisions on a huge scale, policing millions of users with a combination of automated systems and human content moderators.
Other tech companies like Facebook's parent, Meta, and YouTube's parent, Alphabet, have invested in large teams that reduce the spread of violent images on their platforms. Twitter, on the other hand, has scaled back its content moderation since Mr. Musk bought the site late last October, laying off full-time employees and contractors on the trust and safety teams that manage content moderation. Mr. Musk, who has described himself as a "free speech absolutist," said last November that he would establish a "content moderation council" that would decide which posts should stay up and which should be taken down. He later reneged on that promise.
Twitter and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for YouTube said the site had begun removing video of the massacre, adding that it was promoting authoritative information sources.
Graphic content was never completely banned by Twitter, even before Mr. Musk took over. The platform, for instance, has allowed images of people killed or wounded in the war in Ukraine, arguing that they are newsworthy and informative. The company sometimes places warning labels or pop-ups on sensitive content, requiring that users opt in to see the imagery.
While many users clearly spread the images of the massacre, including of the dead attacker, for shock value, others retweeted them to underscore the horrors of gun violence. "The N.R.A.'s America," one tweet read. "This isn't going away," said another. The New York Times is not linking to the social media posts containing the graphic images.
Claire Wardle, the co-founder of the Information Futures Lab at Brown University, said in an interview that tech companies must balance their desire to protect their users with the responsibility to preserve newsworthy or otherwise important images -- even those that are uncomfortable to look at. She cited as precedent the decision to publish a Vietnam War image of Kim Phuc Phan Thi, who became known as "Napalm Girl" after a photo of her suffering following a napalm strike circulated around the world.
She added that she favored graphic images of noteworthy events remaining online, with some kind of overlay that requires users to choose to see the content.
"This is news," she said. "Often, we see this kind of imagery in other countries and nobody bats an eyelid. But then it happens to Americans and people say, 'Should we be seeing this?"'
For years, social media companies have had to grapple with the proliferation of bloody images and videos following terrible violence. Last year, Facebook was criticized for circulating ads next to a graphic video of a racist shooting rampage in Buffalo, N.Y., that was live-streamed on the video platform Twitch. The Buffalo gunman claimed to have drawn inspiration from a 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, that left at least 50 people dead and was broadcast live on Facebook. For years, Twitter has taken down versions of the Christchurch video, arguing that the footage glorifies the violent messages the gunman espoused.
Though the graphic images of the Texas mall shooting circulated widely on Twitter, they seemed to be less prominent on other online platforms on Sunday. Keyword searches for the Allen, Texas, shooting on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube yielded mostly news reports and less explicit eyewitness videos.
Sarah T. Roberts, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who studies content moderation, drew a distinction between editors at traditional media companies and social media platforms, which are not bound by the ethics that traditional journalists adhere to -- including minimizing harm to the viewer and the friends and family of the people who were killed.
"I understand where people on social media are coming from who want to circulate these images in the hopes that it will make a change," Ms. Roberts said. "But unfortunately, social media as a business is not set up to support that. What it's set up to do is to profit from the circulation of these images."

Full text: Mitch Iburg, a ceramic artist, goes to great lengths to ensure that his pieces are easier on the environment.
This article is part of our Design special section about making the environment a creative partner in the design of beautiful homes.
Mitch Iburg, who lives in St. Paul, Minn., makes ancient-looking tableware, vessels and sculptures primarily out of clay that he digs from the earth with his own hands (and some tools). Driving his truck two and half hours to an open valley near the Minnesota River, he comes away with 1,000 or so pounds -- a quantity that will last him roughly a year. (He has permission from the mining company that owns the property.)
Clay was not where his journey began. Born in Wisconsin across the river from Minnesota and raised partly in Iowa City, Iowa, Mr. Iburg, 33, studied painting at Coe College in Iowa. But he was required to take a 3-D fundamentals class and it was there that he developed an appreciation for clay and its roots in nature and antiquity.
In 2015, he applied for a residency at the Cobb Mountain Art and Ecology Project in California partly because the studio sat on top of a clay bed. And when he settled on a place to open a workshop, Studio Alluvium, with a fellow Cobb resident, Zoë Powell, who is now his fiancée, he chose Minnesota to no small extent because he was familiar with the clay.
On top of the matter of earth was the question of fire. Throughout his residency-hopping, Mr. Iburg was drawn to specialized wood-fired kilns, which he continues to use. "My work has changed in each setting in response to the clays that are available and in response to the community of other wood-fire artists in that area," he said.
Wood firing produces different results depending on the type of timber used, how dry it is and how much oxygen is let into the kiln. The clay is typically fired without any glaze, and the texture, color and markings change over the course of several days.
For his wood-fired pieces, Mr. Iburg mostly burns dead trees that have to be cut down for reasons of safety or the health of the forest. Or wood that has fallen in storms. Or the leftovers of traditional sawmills.
"At least we're putting it to work," he said.
Today he wood-fires about 40 percent of his pieces, using a kiln at the College of Saint Benedict in Saint Joseph, Minn.
About 20 percent of his ceramic objects use no thermal energy at all but are left raw. These artworks are made with clay in the natural state in which he finds it, containing stones, bits of wood, pieces of brick, fossils and organic matter.
"If you were to put them in water, they would slake back into workable clay," he said. "Because of this, there's this extra element of fragility."
For more utilitarian pieces, such as teapots, he removes the bits that aren't clay. "If you were to just fire the clay on its own, with all those stones, there is a good chance that there might be a catastrophic melt," he said.
Mr. Iburg also works with an electric kiln in his studio, but does not follow the common technique of firing clay twice -- before and after glaze is put on. He has formulated glazes that can be applied to raw clay and thus require only a single firing. "That was largely a decision to cut down on the electrical usage," he said.
Mr. Iburg's works can be found in several galleries and retail sites. Tommy Zung, who owns a design store in Manhattan called Shop Zung, said he discovered Mr. Iburg on Instagram while looking for artisans "with a mindful approach to craftsmanship." He described Mr. Iburg's methods as "intimate and purposeful, from how his clay was sourced to the meditated imperfections he left to be embraced by its viewers."
For the time being, Mr. Iburg said, his unfired work is "a step that feels positive and not forced or forceful." The moment he started producing those pieces, "it just made a lot of sense because it took some of the pressure off, took some of the guilt off."

Listening to LPs, Learning Trees' Names: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: The actor has analog tastes, like listening to records and walking in the park. He will sneak in a little "Flight Simulator," though.
In the 1990s, Ato Essandoh was planning to become a professor when a girlfriend at Cornell University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, dared him to audition for a play.
He never looked back, landing parts in movies from "Garden State" to "Django Unchained" and TV shows including "Blue Bloods" and "Girls." Now the 50-year-old actor is currently starring opposite Keri Russell in the new Netflix series "The Diplomat."
Mr. Essandoh lives alone in a two-bedroom apartment in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. He is not looking for roommates. "Living with other people is not a problem, but I like being the captain of my own space," he said. "I like walking around in my underwear."
GO-TO I drag myself out of bed weirdly early. I don't want to be around anybody right away, but I'll sort of emerge from my lair, and the first place I go is Peck's, across the street. I'm going to say this right now: Peck's is the best pastry shop and coffee shop on the planet. Their breakfast sandwich game is ridiculous. It's one of the reasons I live in Clinton Hill and won't leave. Nobody I've ever brought there is like, "This is not amazing." Actually, Keri Russell has gone to Peck's. Once I was wearing a Peck's shirt and she's like, "The breakfast sandwiches, right?"
ROOTED Depending on the weather, I'll either sit there and joke around with the owner and manager or I'll take a walk. One of my favorite places to walk is Fort Greene Park. And I just happen to be standing in it right now. I love a good park, and this is a scrappy little park. I was just shooting in London and their parks are amazing because it's the queen's land -- or I guess now the king's -- but in this small, contained park, I know all the trees and I try to remember all the names of them. I also love to go running around the trail here. This place is another reason I stay in Clinton Hill.
OLD SCHOOL Maybe I'll stroll back home and sit in my chair and listen to records. I have a huge record collection. As much as a technophile as I am, I love to listen to actual records. The nice thing about a record is it's not going to try to Tweet you. You don't have to have Wi-Fi or remember a password to listen. No ads pop up. Jazz, blues, hip-hop and classic rock are sort of the bedrock of my musical taste, but it spans all the genres. My Miles Davis and Coltrane records are my favorites. But I love good pop music. Prince is my favorite artist of all time.
THE GEAR A while ago I got a bunch of money. I don't have children, so I spent a college fund's worth of money on a stereo I had to have shipped. I can sit there and listen for hours. Sometimes I'll strum my guitar while I'm listening.
SOUNDS GOOD If I feel like I've been sitting a while, maybe I'll get up and go record shopping. There's a new place I've only checked out one or two times called Head Sounds Records that's like a 15-minute walk away in Fort Greene. You know when you're walking into a record store and the owner's an aficionado and you're instantly like, I don't want to say something stupid? There, you don't feel like you need a pass code to get a great recommendation. I love getting a record I've never heard of.
MR. AMBASSADOR I like to eat an early dinner-brunchy kind of situation. Graziella's is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. I know the owner; he's such a sweet guy. There's also the relatively new Osteria Brooklyn, next to my place, that's owned by another cool Italian dude. I like to go with friends so I can introduce them to the neighborhood. My Manhattan friends usually become Brooklyn converts. I feel like I'm kind of the ambassador to Clinton Hill.
HEADS UP I used to have a policy where on Sunday I don't touch media or look at my phone. But that's gone by the wayside because in our business, it could be your agent calling, saying you need to be on a plane on Monday. You're reminding me I want to bring back the no-media policy. Because the things you miss when you're staring at those two inches of screen can be ridiculous. I've seen eagles in the park because I'm looking up, not looking at my phone. I'm one of those people who, when I'm walking, I'll look in brownstone windows and be like, Ooh! Look at that chandelier. That's me. Again, when you're not looking at your phone, you can see things.
'I'VE GOT THIS' Later I'll probably listen to more records or maybe play a video game or two. I have an Xbox, which has "Flight Simulator" on it. I also have the yoke an actual pilot would use. What fascinates me about that game is, I am legit convinced that if you are on a plane and the flight's going down and the pilot is incapacitated, if there's somebody who's been playing "Flight Simulator" for like 5,000 hours, that person is your best bet to land the plane safely. It's like a public service. Like, guys, don't worry. I'll fly you guys down. I've got this.
BEDTIME Then I turn into a monk. I could be going to bed at 9 or 10 p.m. I love my sleep. That's what gets me up in the morning. As a 50-year-old man, I've learned that. You know what? Clubs were cool when you were 30. Now you're a bad person if you don't have at least seven hours of sleep.
Sunday Routine readers can follow Mr. Essandoh on Twitter and Instagram at @atoessandoh.

Shame Has Become Her Area of Expertise: [Style Desk]

Full text: With body castings of anonymized Pakistani women that resemble oxidized copper statues, Misha Japanwala hopes to create a time capsule of resisting gender violence for her new gallery show.
Misha Japanwala looked around her studio in the week leading up to her gallery show and wondered whether there were "too many nipples."
She was talking, of course, about the nipples she plaster cast from the bodies of 70 anonymized Pakistani people. They are part of Ms. Japanwala's new collection, "Beghairati Ki Nishaani: Traces of Shamelessness," showing at Hannah Traore Gallery in Manhattan from May 4 through July 30.
Ms. Japanwala, a visual artist, who lives in Jersey City, N.J., spent several months last year in Karachi, Pakistan, where she grew up, making body castings of local women and L.G.B.T.Q. people. Her work aims to be a historical record of a population governed by the laws of shame.
In a country where violence against women, including "honor killings," is rampant, bucking social conventions and being branded "shameless" can put a person's life at risk. Attending an Aurat (Women's) March, a rally for women's rights, has led to threats of murder and rape. Conservative and religious leaders have even campaigned to legally ban Aurat Marches while pundits scream obscenities on national television at the women who march with signs such as "Mera Jism Meri Marzi" (My Body, My Choice).
"When so much of our existence has been subject to a campaign of disappearance, this collection is a present day, physical reminder that our lives and our stories are part of the fabric of our people, and will continue to be so even hundreds of years from now," she said.
The Beghairati project was born in the wake of criticism Ms. Japanwala, 27, received for her thesis collection at Parsons in 2018: a series of pieces cast from her own body reflecting on and exploring her personal relationship to shame, the one she inherited in Pakistan. "My thesis was the first time I was actually able to reflect on my identity and understand what a gift my body and my agency was," she said.
As her work gained visibility in editorial spreads like Vogue Spain and on celebrities like Cardi B, Julia Fox and Joy Crookes, she found herself in the eye of a new storm. The comments under pictures of her work on Instagram were littered with strangers calling her shameless, sick and obscene, in both English and Urdu.
As a result, Ms. Japanwala developed an obsession with the concept of shame, transforming shamelessness into an area of study. Working on this project gave her "the understanding that shame and modesty are two entirely different categories that have nothing to do with one another," and that shame is a pillar of patriarchy and a tool for control, she said.
Around the time the idea for this project began to seed, her grandmother died. Ms. Japanwala would walk by marble shops outside the cemetery and watch the workers carve marble figurines and inscriptions into grave stones. She had also long been watching her city fall apart: crumbling building facades, torn up streets and no infrastructure to fix them.
It was at this crossroad that she glimpsed something that resembled the end of the world. Strands of death, disintegration, legacy and agency formed a braid. The collection -- a series of resin body parts with metal coatings aimed to look like oxidized copper statues -- is a fictionalized time capsule of what today's fight for gender equality will look like one day, hundreds of years from now.
There are three parts to the collection: the core, a series of body castings of Pakistani artists and painters who embrace shamelessness in the images they create; a collage of hand sculptures of artists, filmmakers, writers and educators who are forging paths to a more gender-liberated society titled "Hands of a Revolution"; and an anonymous project where nipples serve as unique fingerprints of the subjects, some of whom are recently divorced, transitioning or survivors of breast cancer.
Among her muses are Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, the Oscar-winning documentarian, and Dua Mangi, a woman who survived an abduction that launched a national debate over victim blaming.
The pieces look damaged by the elements and time. They are Ms. Japanwala's artifacts, future found objects and high fidelity that offer unequivocal evidence of Karachiites resisting gender-based violence.
Meetra Javed, a filmmaker who made a short fashion film of Ms. Japanwala's collection, said, "She is unafraid of pushing boundaries, questioning status quos and creating conversations around the liberation of the body." The short features an unreleased song by Ali Sethi, a Pakistani musician who just performed at Coachella, and Gregory Rogove.
"I'm struck by the poetry in Misha's work, which turns nakedness into a paradox of existence: When we wear her breastplates, we are both exposed and armored, bare and barricaded," Mr. Sethi said in an email. "When she asked me to lend a piece of music for the video, I sent my most spare, empty, 'naked' composition yet."
After the devastating floods in Pakistan last year, natural disaster also became part of Ms. Japanwala's visual language for the imaginary future she has created in this collection. She wanted remnants of old life being washed up on the coast of Karachi at the end of one civilization and the beginning of a new one: "When the world ends, that is going to be ground zero, you know what I mean?"

A 'Fabulous' Facade Masks Submerged Pain: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Decades after the sexual revolution and before #MeToo, the writer tucked away her pain and projected a carefree attitude. Now she's accused of having too much fun.
When E. Jean Carroll testified this week in the civil trial around her battery and defamation suit against Donald Trump, it was a certain iteration of feminism -- a style incubated in the 1990s, as game and buoyant as it was repressive -- that had fallen under review. Now 79, Ms. Carroll did not come of age amid the contemporary trauma discourse. As other women of her generation often did, she chose to declutter her mind of distressing experiences rather than maintain an active and all-too-painful inventory.
For a long time, when Ms. Carroll would talk about the violent turn that she said occurred after what seemed like a serendipitous encounter at Bergdorf Goodman with the city's best-known real estate developer, she had been hesitant to use the word "rape."
"I liked the word 'fight,"' she told the courtroom. "I felt it gave me action. It wasn't something done to me."
She was responding to questions from Joseph Tacopina, the former president's lawyer, whose Chevy Suburban masculinity stood out against the crisp economy of her sophistication. On Monday morning, she had arrived at the courthouse in a fitted navy blazer with a Nehru collar and dark glasses beneath her bangs that lent her an Anna Wintour-ish self-assurance -- the essence of a woman who was not easily derailed.
It was this image that Mr. Tacopina sought to make dispositive. His cross-examination aimed to sow suspicion of his client's accuser on the grounds that her public persona offered little indication of whatever grief she was suffering over the assault. (Mr. Trump elected not to appear in court and denies the attack took place.)
In clips presented by the defense -- from interviews with Anderson Cooper, among others, around the 2019 publication of Ms. Carroll's book "What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal," where the allegations at the center of the case were made -- she appeared effervescent, animated, well-suited to a publicity tour.
The contention was, in effect, that she was having too much fun: emailing with Kathy Griffin, getting dinner invitations from Molly Jong-Fast and Mary Trump, still shopping at Bergdorf Goodman so long after the fact. Hadn't her life been "fabulous" in recent years? Mr. Tacopina asked. And if it had been "fabulous," the implication went, how then could it also have been as debased and depleted as Ms. Carroll's testimony suggested?
It was a strategy that seemed to rely, however precariously, on the presumption of social and psychological deficits among jurors who would struggle to recognize that behind a facade of glamour and ambition lay a well of private torment.
Long before we were fully submerged in the world of the disintegrated self, witnessing millions of individual exercises in Instagram PR that so often mask less enviable realities, Ms. Carroll was deeply invested in keeping the negative vibes undercover. "I will always reply that my life is fabulous," she said in her testimony. "If I walked into a courtroom today and you said, 'How are you E. Jean?' I'd say, 'Fine, fabulous,"' she continued. "I always say I'm fine. I put up a front."
The following day, her close friend, the writer Lisa Birnbach, further detailed this approach. Taking the witness stand, she recalled that Ms. Carroll had phoned her immediately after the alleged incident with Mr. Trump "breathless, hyperventilating, emotional," but that the subject did not come up between them again for another quarter century. "Ms. Carroll is a very up person; she is not a victim," Ms. Birnbach said. "Instead of wallowing, she puts on lipstick, dusts herself off and moves on."
Before the eruption of the #MeToo movement, this had served as the operating mode for generations of women who felt they had little recourse to address the injustices they faced at the whims of predatory men.
Ms. Carroll's legal team also called Jessica Leeds, the former stockbroker, now 81, who came forward several years ago to accuse Mr. Trump of groping her on a flight to New York in the late 1970s. Assuming nothing would come of any complaint, she too had tucked the episode away -- a kind of sublimation with which the three women on the jury, all in their 50s and 60s, might find themselves familiar.
In the mid-1990s, decades after the sexual revolution, nearing the declining days of the AIDS crisis and the heyday of elite media, New York seemed to belong to women like E. Jean Carroll. Having grown up in a red brick schoolhouse in Indiana, she became a cheerleader, a beauty queen, a feminist Hemingway -- she claimed to be the first woman to walk from Telefomin in Papua New Guinea, over the mountains to the border of Irian Jaya -- and then, like all the Sister Carries and Carrie Bradshaws before and after, she was an aspiring star who arrived in the city to impress, to beguile, to create, to experience all the stories, to tell them, to miss out on nothing.
In interviews over the past few years, Ms. Carroll has talked about how "delicious" it was to bump into Donald Trump in a revolving door at Bergdorf's, when aimless luxury department-store shopping was still a cherished pastime. This was an anecdote she imagined she would "dine out" on forever. Almost nothing would have compelled her to say, "Sorry! Running out!" when he asked her to help him pick out a gift for a woman he knew. The prospect was too dishy. A pair of big media personalities -- Ms. Carroll was a well-known advice columnist by then -- meeting so unexpectedly to do something vaguely conspiratorial.

At the outset, the story seemed so paradigmatically "New York," Ms. Carroll explained in her testimony. Until it wasn't.

Full text: Dear listeners,
Perhaps you have heard that Taylor Swift is currently on tour.
I kid. Of course you have heard about the Eras Tour -- the record-setting cultural juggernaut that nearly took down Ticketmaster. The concerts started in March, but Eras Tour fever shows no sign of abating. Fans are getting married in the front rows. Entire cities have been temporarily renamed in Swift's honor. People are camping out overnight just to buy merch. A lavender haze has officially descended upon the nation.
For today's playlist, though, let's focus on a less discussed aspect of this tour: the strength, variety and occasional surprises of Swift's opening acts.
Nine artists will be accompanying Swift throughout all the stops of the tour, two playing per night, which gives each performance a bit of novelty and, occasionally, some fun regional specificity. (Haim, those darlings of the San Fernando Valley, are only doing West Coast dates.) The bill is a mix of obvious choices (Haim and Phoebe Bridgers, both Swift collaborators) and unexpected co-signs (the cult-favorite pop group Muna and up-and-coming indie-rocker beabadoobee are welcome surprises). Others, like the Gen-Z singer-songwriters Gracie Abrams and girl in red, represent Swift's artistic progeny; both have cited Swift's music as formative influences on their own and share her sharp eye for emotional detail.
This playlist culls some of the best songs by my favorite of the artists opening for Swift -- and one song that features a cameo from Swift herself. Her tour also includes the teen phenom Gayle (whose viral hit "Abcdefu" you have most likely heard already) and Christian Owens, a former Swift backup dancer who has released a handful of songs under the name Owenn.
Even if you're not much of a Swiftie, this playlist conveniently doubles as both an exploration of the influence that '90s pop-rock has had on a younger generation of artists, and as a fun, breezy soundtrack for the first warm days of the year. I field-tested it on a long walk in New York for that purpose and found it highly appropriate.
1. Haim: "The Steps"
Is this song the clearest distillation of Sheryl Crow's effect on millennial musicians? Is it the best song on Haim's sprawling and fantastic 2020 album "Women in Music Part III"? How awesome was Haim's performance of this song at the 2021 Grammys? I am up for debating any and all of these questions.
2. beabadoobee: "Care"
There are some excellent songs on "Beatopia," the most recent release from the Filipino-British singer-songwriter beabadoobee, but this great single from 2020 is the one that first made me a fan. Even though she was born in 2000, "Care" shows how intuitively she understands something about the sort of scuzzy, anthemic indie-pop that underground labels like Slumberland Records were releasing in the '90s. (A "Best of Slumberland Records" playlist in a future installment of The Amplifier? Now there's an idea.)
3. Muna featuring Phoebe Bridgers: "Silk Chiffon"
Two Eras Tour openers for the price of one! Far and away my favorite song from Muna's 2022 self-titled album, this one is pure pop bliss and a refreshing reverie of queer joy. (When the group played it last weekend at Coachella, it surprised the crowd by bringing out not just Bridgers, but also the other two members of the supergroup boygenius, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker.)
4. Paramore: "Crave"
Here's an underappreciated highlight from Paramore's latest album, "This Is Why." Hayley Williams's vocals on the chorus give me some serious Alanis Morissette vibes.
5. Gracie Abrams: "Best"
I like the dramatic pause Gracie Abrams takes toward the end of this line: "You fell hard, I thought good ... riddance." I also always appreciate a heartbreak song on which the singer takes responsibility for doing the heartbreaking. "Best" is the opening track on Abrams's 2023 debut studio album, "Good Riddance," on which she worked with one of Swift's "Folklore"-era collaborators, the musician and producer Aaron Dessner.
6. girl in red: "I'll Call You Mine"
In the years since she started posting songs online as a teenager, the Norwegian singer-songwriter Marie Ulven Ringheim, now 24, has built a devoted fan base that hangs on her every angsty, sharply observed word. When Swift told her Instagram followers she had the girl in red album "If I Could Make It Go Quiet" "on repeat" in 2021, this was the track she was listening to.
7. Phoebe Bridgers: "Chinese Satellite"
Bridgers's "Punisher," released in June 2020, will always be one of the albums that defined the surreal loneliness of that first pandemic summer for me. Over the years I've cycled through several different favorite tracks -- first "Moon Song," then "Garden Song" -- but if you asked me today I'd say it's "Chinese Satellite." The moment when Bridgers's wry numbness suddenly gives way to a rush of earnestness when she sings, "I'd stand on the corner, embarrassed with a picket sign, if it meant I would see you when I die" never fails to give me chills.
8. Haim featuring Taylor Swift: "Gasoline"
Is "The Steps" the best song on "Women in Music Part III"? The twist ending to this playlist is that I think it may actually be "Gasoline." And I get the sense that Swift agrees with me, given the conviction she brings to her guest verse on this remix. Taste!

Car Bombing Said to Target Russian Writer: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Zakhar Prilepin, who himself fought in eastern Ukraine, has long advocated an imperialist foreign policy by Moscow.
A car bombing on Saturday seriously wounded a prominent Russian nationalist and novelist, while killing his driver, state media reported, one of a series of internal attacks that are spreading a sense of disarray even as the country gears up to celebrate its most important annual military holiday.
The writer and Ukraine combat veteran, Zakhar Prilepin, was conscious with a broken leg and a concussion, in serious but not critical condition, according to state media reports. An explosive device was planted under Mr. Prilepin's Audi S.U.V. in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod, the state news agency Tass reported.
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, called it a "terrorist bombing" in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.
It was the second attack within a week that authorities have referred to as a "terrorist" incident, and it comes amid growing unease among Russia's military and political leaders as they brace for a Ukrainian counteroffensive in a war that has dragged on for 14 months. Other recent attacks have included two explosions on Wednesday over the Kremlin, which did little damage but carried heavy symbolic weight, plus blasts that ignited oil storage facilities and derailed at least two trains in Russia.
One man who officials said confessed to having links to the Ukrainian security services was arrested in the vicinity of the attack, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. REN-TV, a channel close to the Russian security services, reported that a second man who also had possible links to Ukraine was in custody. The explosion was caused by a tank mine buried in the road, the television report said.
The blast was the third to target a leading Russian nationalist figure in the last year. In April, a bombing at a St. Petersburg cafe killed a popular pro-war blogger known as Vladlen Tatarsky. And a car bombing last August killed the television commentator Daria Dugina, a hawk and the daughter of another famous Russian nationalist.
The Foreign Ministry blamed the attack on Ukraine, with help from the United States and its European allies. Russia has said the same thing after each incident, including the previous two assassinations as well as the drone attack on the Kremlin, which Moscow called an effort to assassinate President Vladimir V. Putin.
The Ukrainian security service, S.B.U., said in a statement that it would neither confirm nor deny it had been involved in the car bombing, according to the state Ukrinform news agency.
Washington and Kyiv have denied involvement in all the attacks on Russian soil, although U.S. intelligence agencies eventually concluded that parts of the Ukrainian government authorized the attack that killed Ms. Dugina.
Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal case into the Saturday attack and had sent investigators to the scene. A photograph shared by the committee on Telegram showed a white S.U.V. flipped upside down, with what appeared to be its front half blown off, next to a crater. A murky militant group that combines Ukrainians and Tartars from occupied Crimea claimed responsibility for the attack, as it has in the previous two targeted bombings, but presented no evidence.
Mr. Prilepin was a polemical figure, an accomplished novelist who won praise for his writing style and an ardent nationalist who bragged about his own combat experience in eastern Ukraine. The driver who died was also identified as a veteran of the fighting.
In January, Mr. Prilepin's political party, A Just Russia -- For Truth, announced that he had signed up with Russia's National Guard and been deployed to Ukraine. Last Thursday, Mr. Prilepin posted a picture of himself in military fatigues with a National Guard battalion that he said had spent four months on the battlefield in Ukraine. Critics have accused him of being an Instagram warrior.
Mr. Prilepin became one of Russia's most famous contemporary writers with a gritty novel describing the life of young soldiers in the Chechen wars and went on to organize fighters in the separatist regions of Ukraine.
"I led a combat unit that killed a large number of people," he boasted in a 2019 interview.
Ukraine's intelligence agency, the S.B.U., opened criminal proceedings against Mr. Prilepin in 2017 on suspicion of financing and participating in terrorism.
He has long advocated an imperialist foreign policy. In 2021, he was elected to Russia's Parliament -- a sign of the nationalists' rising stature in President Putin's system -- but gave up his seat. Russian media speculated that Mr. Prilepin might harbor presidential ambitions.
After Mr. Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Mr. Prilepin's aggressively imperialist views, once on the edge of Russia's political mainstream, became the Kremlin's guiding ideology. On Telegram, where Mr. Prilepin has more than 300,000 followers, he was a vocal cheerleader of what the Kremlin calls the "special military operation."
After the car bombing in August that killed Ms. Dugina on her way home from a literary festival he hosted, Mr. Prilepin was quoted as saying that the West had "habituated" Ukraine to such actions.
Like Mr. Putin, Mr. Prilepin often bemoaned the collapse of the Soviet Union, saying that in the years afterward he felt like a stranger in his own country. His 2006 novel "Sankya" depicted the life of a disaffected gang leader who battled with the riot police.
In an introduction to the novel's English publication in 2013, Aleksei Navalny, the prominent jailed opposition figure who early in his career had formed a nationalist party with Mr. Prilepin and another politician, praised the book for capturing the mood of a generation caught between Communism, which they no longer remembered, and the corrupt capitalism in which they had no future.
"In the Russian literary tradition, the 'foresight of the writer' is very important, and Prilepin's foresight would make Tolstoy and Dostoevsky burn with envy," Mr. Navalny wrote. He said that the writer had "predicted the patterns of development of radical political groups and the government's strategy in combating them."
In 2015, Mr. Prilepin said that he felt his books did not reach a wide enough audience among youth, so he wrote and sang an entire album to try to capture both the mood of 1940s Soviet war music and his feelings about the fighting in eastern Ukraine.
Mr. Prilepin also endorsed the massive military celebrations every year on May 9, Victory Day, marking the triumph of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany. Some cities have canceled celebrations this year over security concerns, but the major celebration in Moscow's Red Square is expected to go ahead.
"This is not simply a day in history for me but an event in the life of my family," Mr. Prilepin said in an interview in 2015.
Mr. Prilepin said he could recall the scar tissue from war wounds on one grandfather's shoulder and palm. Memorial days in Europe lack the same visceral feeling, he said. "The difference," he said, "is that here in this country it affected everybody."

Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Over Location Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The ruling was a blow to the commission's intensifying efforts to crack down on the sale and use of sensitive personal information.
A federal judge in Idaho on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit against Kochava, a major location data broker, brought last year by the Federal Trade Commission. In a ruling, the judge wrote that regulators had not provided sufficient evidence to back up their claims that the company was unfairly selling information on the precise locations of millions of people's mobile phones.
But the court gave the F.T.C. the opportunity to strengthen its arguments if it wanted to proceed with the case.
The ruling deals at least a temporary blow to recent aggressive efforts by the commission to crack down on the sale and use of potentially sensitive information, like data on consumers' drug prescriptions, religious affiliations or sexual orientation.
Kochava, based in Sandpoint, Idaho, is a mobile analytics firm that uses location data to help marketers target and measure ad campaigns. The company typically collects more than 90 location data points per day from about 35 million active mobile device users, according to the judge's ruling in the case -- location coordinates that can "reveal where each mobile device has been approximately every 15 minutes."
In its complaint against Kochava, filed last August, the F.T.C. argued that the company's sale of geolocation data on tens of millions of smartphones could be used to track people's visits to private locations such as churches, mosques, synagogues, abortion clinics, domestic violence shelters, medical centers and homeless shelters.
The location data could be used to track not just the dates and times that patients visited abortion clinics, regulators said, but also to track the locations of health care professionals who provided medical treatments like abortions.
In an investigation into location data brokers several years ago, for instance, reporters at The New York Times were able to use a mobile device location data set to track a smartphone user from their home outside of Newark to a Planned Parenthood clinic.
"The sale of such data poses an unwarranted intrusion into the most private areas of consumers' lives and causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers," the F.T.C. complaint said.
But a judge in United States District Court for the District of Idaho dismissed the agency's claim that Kochava's sale of location data was such a severe intrusion on consumers' privacy that it amounted to a substantial injury.
And, while the court agreed with the F.T.C. that Kochava's sale of location data could enable third parties to track and harm smartphone users who visited sensitive locations, the judge said that regulators had not provided adequate evidence that consumers were actually suffering -- or were likely to suffer -- substantial harm.
In a statement, Douglas Farrar, a spokesperson for the F.T.C., said: "We are pleased the Court agreed with our key argument and we look forward to continuing to press our case on behalf of American consumers."
Charles Manning, the founder and chief executive of Kochava, welcomed the judge's ruling, saying that the company complied with "all rules and laws," including privacy laws.
"We are hopeful that challenging the F.T.C. will bring necessary regulatory clarity that will ultimately benefit consumers and advertisers," he said in a statement.
The case dismissal highlights the uphill battle regulators are facing in trying to restrict or bar certain kinds of data collection and usage.
In an administrative action earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission proposed barring Meta from monetizing the personal data of users under the age of 18 on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and other company platforms. Such a blanket ban could prohibit Meta from using young people's data for purposes like targeting advertising or "enriching its own data models and algorithms," the agency said in an administrative order.
Meta said it would "vigorously fight" the F.T.C.'s action and expected to prevail.

Belgrade Is Consumed With Grief for 9 Dead In a School Shooting: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Thousands of students packed a neighborhood in central Belgrade on Thursday afternoon to mourn the eight children and one school guard gunned down by a 13-year-old boy in a shooting rampage that has plunged the Serbian capital into grief and stunned the entire country.
Wearing black, their eyes brimming with tears, the students lit candles, lay white flowers and hung messages scrawled on paper on fences near Vladislav Ribnikar primary school, where the shooting took place a day earlier.
"We're all shocked and saddened," said Luka Zivkovic, 18, a student from a nearby high school who came with dozens of schoolmates to pay his respects. Long streaks of wax ran under his feet, the remnants of hundreds of candles lit by Belgrade residents since Wednesday evening. "This is madness."
The rampage, which also injured six children and a teacher, some of them seriously, has sent shock waves through the country, which has experienced few mass shootings, let alone violence of this sort at a school. Three official days of mourning will begin Friday.
But the shooting has also raised broader questions about gun ownership, a lingering issue in Serbia, prompting the government to approve a series of measures on Thursday designed to better regulate guns, including setting a two-year moratorium on new licenses and enhanced surveillance of shooting ranges.
The changes followed suggestions by President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, who in a speech Wednesday urged the government to address the roots of the tragedy. "It will not go away just like that," Mr. Vucic said.
But in the mourning crowds on Thursday, people were mostly wondering about what led a seventh-grade student known for academic excellence to perpetrate what the police described as a planned, coldblooded attack. Some, including the president, said he had been bullied by classmates, others speculated about other possible motives.
"I don't know what came through his head," said Elena, 13, a student who said she was in a history classroom that was targeted. Her surname is being withheld for privacy reasons. "He was totally normal, everybody liked him."
The police revealed that the student had sketched a map of the school and a list of targets. They added that he called himself a "psychopath" upon his arrest.
The student entered the school with two pistols belonging to his father and four Molotov cocktails, which he had prepared himself.
Serbian officials revealed his identity at a briefing Wednesday, but The New York Times is withholding his name since he is a minor and has not been charged. The officials said the boy would not be held criminally responsible for the killings because is under the age of 14.
The student began shooting immediately upon entering the school, killing the security guard and others before making his way down a corridor toward the history classroom.
Elena, who came to mourn on Thursday wearing a black dress and holding a bouquet of flowers, said she first mistook the shots for fireworks. But she said she then saw the student entering the classroom, shooting the teacher in the stomach and looking around for more targets.
"I went under the table," Elena said, as she described the bloodstained bodies that lay on the ground. "After he killed three people, I met his eyes."
Elena said she managed to flee through the door. Several students at the school said they had been told that some classmates also escaped by jumping from the classroom window into a courtyard.
One girl who was wounded underwent emergency surgery overnight and was in critical condition Thursday, officials said. Among those killed was a French girl, according to the French Foreign Ministry.
The attack shocked residents of Belgrade. "Nobody thought this could happen here in this neighborhood, here in Serbia," said Anita Lainovic, 45, who had come to the school with a pot of flowers to pay tribute to the young victims.
It also prompted many to wonder about the killer's background and upbringing. The student had accompanied his father to a shooting range in the past and knew how to shoot, Serbian officials said. "What did his father teach him by taking him to the shooting range?" Ivana Savic, 49, asked.
In the mourning crowd, somebody held a sign that read, "Someone's child didn't come home because someone did not bring up his child well."
The shooting prompted a large show of solidarity in Belgrade. On Thursday morning, dozens of people lined up for a second day to donate blood at a clinic located a few blocks from the school.
"I have a daughter who's about the age of the victims," said Dragan Bugarin, 59. "When you know that you can help somebody, you do it."
Mr. Bugarin said he was O-negative, a blood type that students from the school said was desperately needed in messages shared on social media Wednesday night. "Urgent!" read one message posted on Instagram calling for donors.
Mirjana Knezevic, the head of communications at the clinic, said that nearly 700 people had come to donate blood on Wednesday, many, many more than on a typical day. She compared the situation with some of the bloodiest days of the war in the former Yugoslavia, part of which makes up Serbia.
Mr. Vucic, the Serbian president, said that the shooter had been taken to a mental health clinic, and that he "showed no remorse." The boy's parents have been arrested, he added.
Following the president's suggestions, the government on Thursday said it would start a sweeping revision of existing gun licenses in Serbia. It added that it would also work on amending the criminal code to hold responsible people enabling minors to handle firearms and would consider lowering the age of criminal liability to 12, from 14.
Serbia has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, a legacy of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, but does not have high levels of gun violence.
A 2018 study by the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey research group estimated that there are about 39 guns for every 100 Serbians, the highest level in Europe and one of the highest in the world. The United States, which ranks first, has about 120 guns per 100 people.
"It's part of our culture, it's a legacy of the war," Ms. Lainovic said. "But it can't go on like this."
Several residents of Belgrade, along with the Serbian education minister, also blamed what they described as the pernicious influence of war video games on young people.
Students and teachers at Vladislav Ribnikar described the school as one of the best in Belgrade, with a particular emphasis on the study of the French language. Their eyes moistened with tears, they recalled the friends they lost.
"She was constantly laughing, she embraced life," said Leda, 12, whose surname is being withheld for privacy reasons, of a friend she said who was killed Wednesday.
Igor Kolundzija, a French teacher at the school, as well as several current and former students said they were particularly saddened by the death of Dragan Vlahovic, the security guard, who was killed while trying to stop the attack, according to officials.
"He was the best, he knew everything about the students, he would look away when they were messing around," Mr. Kolundzija said.
Several messages and drawings attached to a fence near the school paid tribute to him. One of them, by a second-grade student, represented him smiling and wearing a red cape. "Dragan Vlahovic, our hero!" it read.

Full text: Kyiv and Moscow angrily blamed each other after two explosions in an apparent drone attack on the heart of Russian power, but whose outrage is real?
The only indisputable facts about Wednesday's incident at the Kremlin are that there were two explosions around 2:30 a.m. above Russia's most important political and cultural symbol, and that both Moscow and Ukraine reacted with outrage.
But whose outrage was real and whose was feigned?
In this war, the battle over the narrative is as important as the battle in the field. While the Kremlin frequently lies and uses its powerful government-controlled media to craft alternative realities, Ukraine, too, has proved adept at bending the truth to serve its wartime agenda.
Cutting through the competing narratives to get to the truth can prove to be a tricky thing, and that perhaps is the point. Both sides stand to gain when their intentions and methods remain obscured by fog.
Was the apparent drone attack a bold but largely symbolic action by Ukraine aimed at embarrassing President Vladimir V. Putin as he prepares to preside over the annual Victory Day Parade on Red Square next week? Was it a staged Russian provocation meant to justify still harsher attacks on the Ukrainian population, or perhaps against Ukraine's leadership?
Or was it executed by neither government, but by local Russian partisans opposed to the war, or rogue Ukrainian saboteurs?
Russia angrily accused Ukraine of trying to assassinate Mr. Putin with a drone attack, and asserted its right to retaliate.
On Thursday, Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said repeatedly in a conference call with journalists that the United States had ordered the attack, without offering any evidence. "We know well that the decisions about such actions and such terrorist acts are made not in Kyiv, but in Washington," he said.
U.S. officials vehemently denied any involvement. On MSNBC's "Morning Joe," John F. Kirby, communications chief for the White House's National Security Council, said, "Peskov is just lying there, pure and simple."
Ukraine also denied trying to strike the Kremlin and accused Moscow of essentially ginning up a provocative incident to rally domestic support and justify escalation.
A Ukrainian strike on the seat of the Russian government would constitute an audacious act. But the Kremlin said nothing about it for 12 hours.
When the press service finally did get around to accusing Ukraine, it did so in an unusually detailed statement, suggesting it was eager for the episode to gain maximum public exposure.
That set off a flurry of public denials in Kyiv, as well as some private head-scratching from Ukrainian officials who are usually quick with a wink and a nod to indicate association with daring and creative covert operations. They noted that the explosions were too small to accomplish much.
"Pretty, but ineffective, unfortunately," said one senior Ukrainian official when asked about the attack shortly after the Kremlin issued its statement. "At the moment I don't know who did it. It seems it wasn't ours."
Someone knows what really happened, but no one, for now, is talking. More than a day later, no new information has emerged that might clarify who was behind the explosions, but that has not prevented inflammatory statements and wild speculation from flourishing.
On Thursday, Russian officials continued to double down. The foreign ministry released a lengthy statement, saying those guilty of carrying out what it called "terrorist attacks" would face "severe and inevitable punishment."
In this case, Ukraine and Russia each had the means and the motive to carry out the attack.
In more than 14 months of war Ukraine has become adept at brazen actions heavy with symbolic significance. The strike last spring that sunk Russia's Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, did little to slow the relentless Russian attacks on Ukraine, but was a deeply humbling setback for Russia's military.
The blast last summer on the sole bridge linking Russian territory to the occupied Crimean Peninsula slowed down the transport of military supplies for a short time, but dealt another embarrassing blow to Mr. Putin, whose forces had failed to protect an important strategic asset far from the front lines.
Ukraine has spent the war developing lethal drones that have terrorized troops on the battlefield and struck far behind enemy lines. Last December, Ukraine sent modified explosive drones hundreds of miles into Russian territory for attacks on two military bases that damaged planes and killed several soldiers.
In these cases and others, Ukrainian officials have not taken responsibility publicly, though they often have not denied outright their country's involvement. Off the record, senior officials will sometimes acknowledge their forces have participated.
Wednesday's episode was different. Top officials from Mr. Zelensky down issued immediate and unequivocal denials.
"Ukraine certainly has nothing to do with drone attacks on the Kremlin," said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president. "It makes absolutely no sense. It provides no military, informational, or tactical effect on the eve of an offensive."
The swift, firm denials may carry meaning, but what that meaning is remains open to speculation.
Mr. Podolyak suggested that the explosions were in fact a so-called "false flag" operation by the Kremlin -- intended to make it seem like Ukraine was at fault -- to justify a potential large-scale attack aimed at undermining Ukraine's expected counteroffensive.
He did not explain why Moscow would need such justification. Mr. Putin's military has been launching massive attacks and killing civilians since the beginning of the war without feeling the need to put forth elaborately crafted excuses.
The United States Embassy in Kyiv issued a warning late Wednesday that there was a heightened risk of Russian missile attacks, and on Thursday the Ukrainian military said it had shot down missiles and drones over Kyiv and Odessa.
Mr. Zelensky contrasted the explosions at the Kremlin, which Mr. Putin's press service called a terrorist attack, with attacks by the Russian military on Ukrainian cities the same day. While Russian officials said the explosions in Moscow caused no injuries, Mr. Zelensky shared gruesome photos of dead civilians after a Russian attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, which killed at least 23 people at a grocery store and a train station, among other civilian targets.
"We will never forgive the culprits," Mr. Zelensky said in a post on Instagram. "We will defeat the evil state and hold all the perpetrators to account."
The Kremlin, of course, is adept at deception and has never shown reticence to promote outright lies.
Mr. Putin's stated justification for his invasion -- that Ukraine was ruled by a Nazi junta committed to violence against Russia -- was fabricated. Last week, a Russian state television report describing a Ukrainian attack on a Russian-controlled city used footage that was actually from a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Uman, which killed more than 20 people.
Russia uses such distortion to promote an alternative reality that justifies its actions in the war, both to its own people and its allies, experts say.
Already, Russian officials have used the Kremlin incident to call for reprisals. Dmitri Medvedev, Russia's bombastic former president and now deputy chairman of the Russian Federation's security council -- who often voices the most extreme versions of potential Russian actions -- said the explosions justified "the physical elimination" of Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky and "his clique." He sprinkled in a Hitler reference for good measure.
Explaining the 12-hour time lag between the explosions and the Kremlin's announcement, Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said there was a need by Russia's spy services to conduct an investigation first. Mr. Putin was working at the Kremlin on Thursday, Mr. Peskov said, and would make no special statement about the explosions.

Beer Giant to Refocus Marketing After Stir Over Transgender Ad: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Executives at the beer giant told analysts that Bud Light's focus going forward will be on sports and music.
The beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev on Thursday said that it would focus its marketing campaigns around sports and music and assign senior executives to oversee them, in the wake of controversy over a Bud Light promotion featuring a transgender influencer.
Anheuser-Busch reported a 13.6 percent increase in first quarter earnings before interest, taxes and other expenses, to $ 4.7 billion; and a 13.2 percent jump in global revenues to $ 14.2 billion from a year earlier, mostly because of higher pricing and despite a decline in beer volume in many markets, including North America.
In a call with analysts to discuss the financial results, Anheuser-Busch executives were peppered with questions about the backlash. They repeatedly noted that the promotion was limited to one influencer, Dylan Mulvaney, and one social media post, and that beer cans displaying her image had not been produced for mass distribution.
The company said that senior executives would oversee all marketing campaigns before they are rolled out, and that it would largely focus its advertising and marketing around sports and music. The company noted it was a sponsor of the recent NFL draft and the Stagecoach music festival in California last week.
"Everything we do should be about beer and promoting beer," Michel Doukeris, Anheuser-Busch's chief executive, told analysts.
"Beer will always be at the table when a debate is happening, but the beer itself should not be the focus of the debate," he added.
Bud Light has been the subject of a firestorm since mid-March when Ms. Mulvaney posted a video on her Instagram account to promote a Bud Light March Madness contest to her 1.8 million followers. In her post, which was less than a minute long, she said that the company had sent a tallboy can of Bud Light featuring her photo. An image of the can was edited into the video.
The social media post elicited a significant response as conservative celebrities and politicians called for a boycott of the brand. Soon, calls came for a reverse boycott, or buycott, encouraging people to buy Bud Light to show support for the marketing.
Sales of Bud Light slumped in early April, raising concern among investors that the post would both damage Bud Light's position in the marketplace and that of other Anheuser-Busch brands. Bud Light sales fell 17 percent in the week ending April 15, according to Beer Business Daily.
Executives downplayed the decline, noting that it represented about 1 percent of total global volume and it was too early to determine if it would continue.
Anheuser-Busch shares rose nearly 3 percent after the call, to $ 65.56, and are up 10 percent for the year. Its stock sank to lows of around $ 63 in April when data began to show the drop in sales.
In late April, the company said that it had placed two executives involved in the promotion on leave: Alissa Heinerscheid, the vice president of marketing for Bud Light, and Daniel Blake, who oversees marketing for Anheuser-Busch's mainstream brands.

My Emotional Support Chatbot: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Pi, an A.I. tool that debuted this week, is a twist on the new wave of chatbots: It assists people with their wellness and emotions.
For several hours on Friday evening, I ignored my husband and dog and allowed a chatbot named Pi to validate the heck out of me.
My views were "admirable" and "idealistic," Pi told me. My questions were "important" and "interesting." And my feelings were "understandable," "reasonable" and "totally normal."
At times, the validation felt nice. Why yes, I am feeling overwhelmed by the existential dread of climate change these days. And it is hard to balance work and relationships sometimes.
But at other times, I missed my group chats and social media feeds. Humans are surprising, creative, cruel, caustic and funny. Emotional support chatbots -- which is what Pi is -- are not.
All of that is by design. Pi, released this week by the richly funded artificial intelligence start-up Inflection AI, aims to be "a kind and supportive companion that's on your side," the company announced. It is not, the company stressed, anything like a human.
Pi is a twist in today's wave of A.I. technologies, where chatbots are being tuned to provide digital companionship. Generative A.I., which can produce text, images and sound, is currently too unreliable and full of inaccuracies to be used to automate many important tasks. But it is very good at engaging in conversations.
That means that while many chatbots are now focused on answering queries or making people more productive, tech companies are increasingly infusing them with personality and conversational flair.
Snapchat's recently released My AI bot is meant to be a friendly personal sidekick. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is "developing A.I. personas that can help people in a variety of ways," Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, said in February. And the A.I. start-up Replika has offered chatbot companions for years.
A.I. companionship can create problems if the bots offer bad advice or enable harmful behavior, scholars and critics warn. Letting a chatbot act as a pseudotherapist to people with serious mental health challenges has obvious risks, they said. And they expressed concerns about privacy, given the potentially sensitive nature of the conversations.
Adam Miner, a Stanford University researcher who studies chatbots, said the ease of talking to A.I. bots can obscure what is actually happening. "A generative model can leverage all the information on the internet to respond to me and remember what I say forever," he said. "The asymmetry of capacity -- that's such a difficult thing to get our heads around."
Dr. Miner, a licensed psychologist, added that bots are not legally or ethically accountable to a robust Hippocratic oath or licensing board, as he is. "The open availability of these generative models changes the nature of how we need to police the use cases," he said.
Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection's chief executive, said his start-up, which is structured as a public benefit corporation, aims to build honest and trustworthy A.I. As a result, Pi must express uncertainty and "know what it does not know," he said. "It shouldn't try to pretend that it's human or pretend that it is anything that it isn't."
Mr. Suleyman, who also founded the A.I. start-up DeepMind, said that Pi was designed to tell users to get professional help if they expressed wanting to harm themselves or others. He also said Pi did not use any personally identifiable information to train the algorithm that drives Inflection's technology. And he stressed the technology's limitations.
"The safe and ethical way for us to manage the arrival of these new tools is to be superexplicit about their boundaries and their capabilities," he said.
To refine the technology, Inflection hired around 600 part-time "teachers," which included therapists, to train its algorithm over the last year. The group aimed to make Pi more sensitive, more factually accurate and more lighthearted when appropriate.
On some issues, like misogyny or racism, Pi takes a stand. On others, like geopolitics, it is more evenhanded "in a way that will for sure upset both sides," Mr. Suleyman said.
I started using Pi on Friday by typing queries into a cream-colored box on Inflection's website and, later, in its free app. A green cursor swayed before Pi revealed its responses, one paragraph at a time. Mr. Suleyman said the free service may eventually charge some users a fee.
Pi's boundaries are easy to find. When I tried picking fights, I mostly received kindness in return. "I appreciate you saying that," Pi's text gently unfurled on my screen. "I think it's important to see things from all perspectives, and not to just focus on the negative."
Over time, that relentless balance wore on me, making my instinct to argue seem ridiculous. Which, I realized, was precisely the point.
On heavier topics, like abortion laws or cancel culture, Pi asked pointed questions that pushed me to re-examine my opinions. "That's a tough position to take," it said at one point. "That's a consistent set of beliefs," it said at another.
On lighter topics, like movies, cooking or gardening, the chatbot provided highly specific, difficult-to-Google recommendations. Oddly, Pi seemed to nudge me to join the anticapitalist movement.
Pi remembered some things from earlier in the conversation but forgot others. It "hallucinated" a few times, accusing me of expressing opinions I had not. But it quickly apologized when I made note of it.
When I asked Pi for some gossip, it infuriatingly dangled a "juicy celebrity rumor" about Jennifer Lopez. Was I sitting down? (Yes.) Was I ready for the dirt? (Yes.) The rumor? "She is secretly a mole person! ð Just kidding!" (Give me a break.)
Pi sometimes reminded me of Karen Collins, a character from the TV show "Veep." Karen annoys the other characters with her equivocating babble, like, "There are pros and cons to every candidate, so we just need to weigh out the pros and cons," or "I think there's a lot to think." Many of Pi's comments have that milquetoast quality of taking many words to say nothing.
Sherry Turkle, a psychologist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said these kinds of interactions can "push us along a road where we're encouraged to forget what makes people special."
"The performance of empathy is not empathy," she said. "The area of companion, lover therapist, best friend is really one of the few areas where people need people."
It wasn't until Monday morning, after hours of intermittent chatting throughout the weekend, that I had my "aha" moment with Pi.
I was feeling overwhelmed with work and unsure of how to structure my day, a recurring hangup that often prevents me from getting started. "Good morning," I typed into the app. "I don't have enough time to do everything I need to do today!"
With a level of enthusiasm only a robot could muster before coffee, Pi pushed me to break down my to-do list to create a realistic plan. Like much of the bot's advice, it was obvious and simple, the kind of thing you would read in a self-help article by a productivity guru. But it was tailored specifically to me -- and it worked.
"I'm going to ask you to list all the remaining tasks you have to do on that story, and we'll prioritize them together," it said.
I could have dumped my stress on a family member or texted a friend. But they are busy with their own lives and, well, they have heard this before. Pi, on the other hand, has infinite time and patience, plus a bottomless well of encouraging affirmations and detailed advice.
Pi uses the language of cognitive behavioral therapy. On Monday afternoon, it suggested I "make space" for my negative feelings and "practice being grateful for one thing." It followed that up with a series of breath-work and muscle-relaxation exercises.
I responded with a shrug emoji, followed by "Pass."
A therapist might have balked at such rudeness but Pi simply noted that I was not alone. "A lot of people find it difficult to relax on command," it wrote.

FIFA Chief Threatens European TV Blackout Of Women's World Cup: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gianni Infantino said matches would not be shown in the continent's biggest markets this summer unless broadcasters meet FIFA's demands for higher fees.
The president of soccer's global governing body on Tuesday harshly criticized European broadcasters for not meeting FIFA's demands for significantly higher television rights fees for this summer's Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. If the offers did not improve, he threatened, the tournament's matches would not be televised in many of Europe's biggest markets.
"It is our moral and legal obligation not to undersell the FIFA Women's World Cup," the president, Gianni Infantino, said in an appearance at the World Trade Organization in Geneva. "Therefore, should the offers continue not to be fair, we will be forced not to broadcast the FIFA Women's World Cup into the 'Big 5' European countries," he added. That group includes England, Germany, France, Spain and Italy -- all of whom will send teams to the tournament.
Reeling off unverifiable figures, Infantino labeled the offers for the World Cup rights "a slap in the face" not only to the World Cup's players but to women generally.
The comments escalated a fight Infantino opened last year, when he and FIFA rejected initial offers for rights to the women's championship from several countries as far too low. At the time, he framed the battle as one over fairness, and he has since positioned himself as a champion of women's soccer by increasing prize money for this year's tournament and pledging to equalize it with the men's World Cup by 2027.
But he will need hundreds of millions of dollars from broadcasters and sponsors to fulfill those promises, and his threat that the games might not be broadcast in Europe -- a major driver of the growth of the women's game -- comes with serious risks.
With little over two months to go until the start of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand and little sign of an accord, the dispute risks overshadowing the biggest Women's World Cup yet. FIFA has expanded the event to 32 teams for the first time as a sign of its commitment to grow the women's game, and it has increased the prize money for players and the support money for participating teams to $ 150 million, a fivefold increase from the last tournament, which was held in France in 2019.
Infantino had hoped that much of that commitment would be financed by higher rights fees from international broadcasters. But in a rebuke to media companies both at the World Cup draw in Auckland last year and at FIFA's annual meeting in March in Rwanda, he said that was not the case. Each time, he lashed out at the television companies for not paying more for a product that, he said, viewership figures had proved was increasingly popular.
With little movement since then, he took an even tougher line in his latest comments.
"I call, therefore, on all players, fans, football officials, presidents, prime ministers, politicians and journalists all over the world to join us and support this call for a fair remuneration of women's football," he said, repeating his remarks on his Instagram account. "Women deserve it. As simple as that."
While women's soccer in the United States -- where a TV deal is in place -- and in Europe has enjoyed greater investment and viewership in recent years, figures for even its biggest games are often significantly lower than for comparable men's soccer games, and less attractive matches sometimes struggle to attract even in-stadium audiences. Broadcasters also appear to be taking a cautious stance on assigning a value to Women's World Cup rights that have never previously been on the market. This year is the first time FIFA has decoupled the women's tournament from the men's; previously, the women's rights were bundled as an extra in the bidding for the men's World Cup rights.
Acknowledging that playing the tournament in Australia and New Zealand might be a factor for broadcasters in Europe, Infantino nonetheless said the sums currently being offered for the tournament were a fraction of what FIFA considers its true value. He noted that while viewing figures for the women's tournament are 50 percent to 60 percent of those for the men's World Cup, the amounts offered for the women's games have been much lower than that: In Europe alone, he said, they were "20 to 100 times lower than for the men's FIFA World Cup."
"Whereas broadcasters pay $ 100-200 million for the men's FIFA World Cup," Infantino said, "they offer only $ 1-10 million for the FIFA Women's World Cup. This is a slap in the face of all the great FIFA Women's World Cup players and indeed of all women worldwide."
There has been a substantial interest in women's soccer in Britain, Europe's biggest market, which peaked when England beat Germany to win the European championship on home soil last year. That final was played in front of a packed Wembley Stadium and watched by more than 17 million on television, the highest audience for a televised women's game in Britain. The figure for the final represented 35 percent of the total global audience for the game, according to data from European soccer's governing body.
The same data, though, highlights how certain women's games in certain markets draw large audiences but highlights concerns among broadcasters over viewing figures for games not featuring premium teams in a tournament that will feature more games than ever. According to news media reports, the BBC and ITV -- the two main British broadcasters -- have offered about 9 million pounds ( $ 11.2 million) for the World Cup rights, the highest among European broadcasters. The offer from Italy is about $ 1 million.
The inability of FIFA and broadcasters to reach rights agreements in the next two months does not necessarily mean the games will be unavailable to fans in Europe. FIFA officials have previously spoken about possible alternatives, including airing the games on its own streaming platform or on FIFA's YouTube channel. Such a move would carry its own risks, however, both by reducing viewing figures and revenue for an event -- and a sport -- that FIFA has a stated commitment to grow.

Full text: Tony nominators singled out new faces and set up fascinating face-offs, but missed the chance to recognize a Native American breakthrough.
Not everyone can wake up to good news on Tony nominations morning. Then again, with a panel of voters often un-wowed by celebrity, the roster typically turns up left-field choices and anoints young talent.
So it went Tuesday. Broadway royalty didn't get the royal treatment -- nor did the actors playing King Arthur and Guinevere in "Camelot." But a 24-year-old Katy Perry-singing Juliet, and a playwright who stepped into the high heels of a whirlwind named Peaches, found themselves in a very welcome spotlight.
Here are some of the snubs, surprises and further observations about the nominations list:
Surprise: 'Ain't No Mo"
By commercial measures, Jordan E. Cooper's scabrous comedy "Ain't No Mo"' was a Broadway failure, closing after 23 previews and only 28 performances. But the Tony committee gave the show's team something to laugh about, lavishing six nominations, including two for Cooper himself: best play and best featured actor in a play. Cooper, who portrayed a saucy airline hostess named Peaches, gave it his all, onstage and off: When the show's sudden closing was first announced, he took to Instagram to rally audiences. "They've posted an eviction notice," he wrote, "but thank God Black people are immune to eviction notices." His urgings led the play to stay open another week -- perhaps long enough for more Tony nominators to see it.
Snub: Mr. and Mrs. Brustein
Responding to what they saw as pent-up demand to see "The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window" after a sellout run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, producers pulled a surprise by adding the revival of Lorraine Hansberry's 1964 play to the Broadway season on the last possible night. Yet Tony voters passed on nominating Oscar Isaac and Rachel Brosnahan for their sexy, impassioned portrayals of a fraying couple in 1960s Greenwich Village. Only Miriam Silverman, as Brosnahan's starchy sister, got an acting nod in her supporting part.
Surprise: Double Acts
The race for leading actor in both plays and musicals was going to be tight, given the bounty of big performances in big roles -- including several productions with two potential competing nominees. It wasn't out of the question that only one actor would get in, but Tony nominators decided otherwise, recognizing both Corey Hawkins and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as the brothers Lincoln and Booth in "Topdog/Underdog," and Christian Borle and J. Harrison Ghee as jazz musicians on the lam in "Some Like It Hot." Share-and-share-alike didn't apply in all cases, however, as only Jessica Hecht was nominated for "Summer, 1976" -- a two-hander with Laura Linney the only other performer onstage.
Snub: Broadway Royalty
Along with Linney, already a five-time nominee, other members of Broadway royalty woke up to a gloomy morning. Neither the former winners Nathan Lane nor Danny Burstein, beloved and vibrant Broadway presences and stars of "Pictures From Home," secured a nomination. Then again, the six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald did get her 10th nod, for her fierce yet fragile performance in "Ohio State Murders," where she'll face off against Jessica Chastain ("A Doll's House"), Jodie Comer ("Prima Facie") -- and Hecht, in an oddly sparse roster of four performers.
Surprise: Off Broadway Royalty
Amid the starrier names announced on Tuesday were a handful of lesser-known actors who have provided years, sometimes decades, of astonishing work Off Broadway. Arian Moayed, a versatile and ardent actor and a co-founder of the theater company Waterwell, was nominated for his turn as one of stage history's all-time worst husbands in "A Doll's House." David Zayas, a familiar face in the early plays of Stephen Adly Guirgis before TV fame in "Dexter" and other series, received a nod for playing a wounded caregiver in "Cost of Living." So did Kara Young, a firecracker of an actress, nominated for her brassy, anguished work in the play (Young's second nomination in a row). And that's not to mention Silverman, so canny and intense in "Sidney Brustein's Window."
Snub: A Native American Breakthrough
The producers of Larissa Fasthorse's "The Thanksgiving Play" didn't have much to be thankful for Tuesday morning. Thought to be the first play by a Native American woman to have a Broadway run, the show was entirely shut out. The play is a comedy that shows four white Americans fumbling toward a devised work that celebrates Native American Heritage Month, but it is also a parable of Native American erasure, which makes the exclusion disconcerting.
Surprise: Juliet Lives!
Seems like that "happy dagger" turned out pretty happy after all in "& Juliet," an infectious jukebox musical that imagines what might have happened had Juliet found her way back out of the tomb. With competition from the likes of Phillipa Soo ("Camelot"), Patina Miller ("Into the Woods") and Anna Uzele ("New York, New York"), a nomination for Lorna Courtney, the 24-year-old actress playing Juliet, seemed anything but assured. But with the love of the nominating committee, Courtney has something to roar about.
Snub: Song Sung Blue(s)
Portraying a legendary pop performer has become a sure path to a Tony. Just ask Adrienne Warren ("Tina"), Jessie Mueller ("Beautiful") or Myles Frost, who helped announce the nominations after winning a prize last season for playing Michael Jackson in "MJ." Will Swenson won't be as fortunate, as his impressive impression of Neil Diamond in "A Beautiful Noise" went unnoticed, as did the musical as a whole. "So good, so good"? Not today.

The Restaurant Recipes You Want to Cook: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Some dishes are so good that you simply must recreate them at home.
We've all heard it before: Why go to a restaurant to eat something you can make at home? But sometimes you order something so incredible, so unforgettable, that you immediately want the recipe to make whenever you feel like it.
Here at The Times, we've been collecting restaurant recipes -- which can be found on New York Times Cooking -- for decades, from high-end French restaurants to neighborhood spots. Adapting these dishes presents challenges because chefs tend to, well, chef things up. Nevertheless, we persist.
So let's take a look at some recipes we've already collected from restaurants, as well as some that I desperately want for my own kitchen. And I'd love to know which New York City restaurant recipes you've always wanted. Email me at wheretoeat@nytimes.com.
A Brief History of Restaurant Recipes in The Times
Craig Claiborne, an early Food editor at The Times, devoted much time to improving home-cooking classics like the chicken salad sandwich and beef stroganoff. But he and the columnist and chef Pierre Franey also adapted restaurant recipes, like the Grand Marnier soufflé perfected at La Côte Basque in New York.
In the more recent past, our reporters and columnists have collected an array of recipes from restaurants in our own backyard, including Via Carota's insalata verde, the Nashville-style hot fried chicken from Peaches HotHouse, the bulgogi sliders from Danji, Roberta's pizza dough and a standout celery Victor salad served at Inga's Bar.
Alexa Weibel, a recipe editor at New York Times Cooking who often adapts chefs' recipes, told me that she works to highlight details that chefs internalize, like cooking times, temperatures and signs of doneness. "The end goal is truly to create recipes that capture the magic of the chef's creation, but are as doable as they are delicious," she said.
A Recipe Wish List
And what recipes do I want for my kitchen? Well, the first dish that comes to mind is the tardivo salad at Raf's, the new restaurant and bakery in NoLIta from the team behind the Musket Room. I'm not a radicchio fan -- I like only my cocktails bitter -- but this salad made with curled fingers of the tardivo varietal has me reconsidering my position.
It isn't doused in dressing, but rather topped with pistachios, Cara Cara and blood oranges, ricotta salata, lemon and olive oil. That all sits on a schmear of Sicilian pistachio purée that drew a collective raised eyebrow from everyone at my table. Given the chance, I'd serve that salad at every dinner party from here to eternity.
But when I think of a recipe I'd make for myself every day, it's always the luscious confit tuna melt served on thick slices of Pullman bread at Agi's Counter, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. It's the generous use of dill that keeps me coming back. Boy, do I love dill. And the sharp, nose-hair-burning mustard they serve on the side demands to be consumed to the last spoonful.
Ras Plant Based, a vegan Ethiopian restaurant in Crown Heights, serves incredible bolé bowls, a stew of chickpeas, steamed collard greens, cabbage, carrots, bell peppers and avocado salad run through with turmeric, cumin, basil, jalapeños and more. Whenever I'm craving a meal with as many ingredients as possible, this is the recipe I want. The disparate parts add up to a soul-warming amalgam of damn goodness that had me hooked when I tried it last fall at The New York Times Food Festival.
Stay tuned. Maybe I'll be able to charm my way into the grand tradition of bringing restaurant recipes to home kitchens everywhere.
In Other News ...
This week Pete Wells reviewed Naro, the Rockefeller Center restaurant from the team behind Atomix and Atoboy. He writes that the restaurant "aims for a blend of formality and friendliness" while serving inspired takes on Korean traditional foods as well as some that predate the 20th century.

Williams, 'Not Retired,' Is Pregnant: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Williams said last year that she was stepping back from competing on the women's tennis tour because she wanted to grow her family.
Serena Williams has resisted saying publicly that she has retired from tennis and the finality that would bring, but now she has another reason to stay away from competition in the near future.
Amid the costume-themed glitz of the Met Gala on Monday night Williams announced, both on the red carpet and on social media, that she was pregnant with her second child.
She attended the event with her husband, Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of Reddit, and said in a post on Instagram that she "was so excited when Anna Wintour invited the 3 of us to the Met Gala."
On the red carpet before the event, Ohanian put his hand on his wife's stomach in a gesture indicating a pregnancy. Williams also posted a series of portraits that included an image of her cradling her stomach with both hands.
Williams was not the only pregnant celebrity at the gala. The singer Rihanna, who wore a white Valentino gown on Monday night, made her pregnancy public during her halftime performance at the Super Bowl in February.
Williams and Ohanian had their first child, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in 2017. Williams had won the Australian Open that year while roughly two months pregnant.
She returned to tennis and made four more Grand Slam finals in 2018 and 2019, although she did not add to her total of 23 Grand Slam singles titles.
In August, Williams said she would step away from tennis after the U.S. Open. But last October she said she was "not retired" and that the chance she would come back at some point was "very high." Officially, she is on the retired list.
In an essay in Vogue at the time of her retirement, she wrote: "If I were a guy, I wouldn't be writing this because I'd be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I'd be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity." Brady, the star N.F.L. quarterback, played until he was 45 and announced his retirement in February.
Williams, 41, has won 23 Grand Slam singles events, starting in 1999, when she was 17: seven Australian Opens, three French Opens, seven Wimbledons, and six U.S. Opens. The total is one short of the record of 24, set by Margaret Court, although about half of Court's wins came in the pre-1968 amateur era.

Full text: Replacing ill will with good will has marked mental health benefits.
Jancee Dunn is out this week. I'm Catherine Pearson, a reporter on the Well desk, filling in today.
For someone who's led a charmed life, my 8-year-old can hold a serious grudge. Out of the blue, he recently brought up "that bad pencil thing that happened." It took me a while to divine that he was talking about the classmate who nabbed one of his writing utensils ... nearly two years ago.
I thought about my son's inability to let go of The Great Pencil Incident of First Grade when I learned recently about new research that suggests forgiveness improves mental well-being -- and offers a road map for getting there.
In the study, which was presented last week at an interdisciplinary conference on forgiveness at Harvard and is currently under review for publication, researchers randomly assigned 4,598 participants from five countries into groups. One set received a forgiveness workbook with exercises they completed on their own. (An example: Write the story of a specific hurt you want to forgive. Then write it again as more of an observer, without emphasizing how bad the wrongdoer was or how you felt victimized. Look for at least three differences between the two versions.) Those in the control group waited for two weeks before receiving the workbook.
When the two weeks were up, researchers found that those participants who'd completed the workbook felt more forgiving than those in the control group -- and had reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression. These findings jibe with other studies on forgiveness, which have found it can be a boon to mental health, helping to do things like lower stress and improve sleep.
"What forgiveness does is sort of free the victim from the offender," said Tyler VanderWeele, the director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard and one of the co-authors of the study. "I would never say 'Once you've forgiven, everything's fine."' But it is a better alternative to rumination or suppression, he said. And that is likely why it can improve overall mental well-being.
As my son shows, it can be hard to forgive even minor transgressions -- and I'm not dunking on him here. I could easily prattle off a list of perceived offenses I've been holding onto for years. But Dr. VanderWeele believes forgiveness is a skill that can be practiced. I spoke to him about how to get started.
Questions and answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.
What does it mean to forgive someone?
My working definition is just to replace ill will toward the offender with good will. Forgiveness is not forgetting the action or pretending it didn't happen; it's not excusing or condoning the action, and it's not the same as reconciling or forgoing justice. One can forgive while still pursuing a just outcome.
The workbook in the study relies heavily on the work of one of your study co-authors, Everett Worthington, who has a remarkable forgiveness story himself: His mother was murdered in the mid-1990s, and he forgave the perpetrator. What are some of the core strategies?
One is to recall the hurt, don't try to suppress it. Another is to try and empathize with the offender -- without condoning them or invalidating your own feelings.
Easier said than done!
One exercise is to set up two chairs and pretend the offender is in one of them. After describing what happened from your perspective, you sit in the chair of the offender and describe what happened from theirs. It can be a bit unsettling, but it's a very powerful experience.
Do you think people can get better at forgiveness over time?
It is possible to move to a more forgiving disposition -- to think, How do I want to interact with the world more generally? This is most certainly not going to be the last time I'm hurt or offended by others, so when this happens again, might I be in a better position to forgive?
In a society like the one we're living in, with increasing polarization and animosity, that disposition to forgive is potentially very much needed.

Full text: A new series about the woman who hid Anne Frank and her family premieres on National Geographic, and E! streams "the party of the year."
Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, May 1-7. Details and times are subject to change.
Monday
E! LIVE FROM THE RED CARPET: MET GALA 2023 6 p.m. on E! Officially known as the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit (unofficially as the party of the year) and attended by some of the biggest names in the media and art world, the Met Gala is a black-tie event that raises money for the fashion wing of the museum. This year's themed exhibition is "Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," a homage to the longtime luxury brand designer who helped shape the modern fashion world. (Mr. Lagerfield died in 2019). Michaela Coel, Penélope Cruz, Roger Federer, Dua Lipa are the event's co-chairs this year.
A SMALL LIGHT 9 p.m. on LIFETIME, NGC and NAT GEO WILD. This limited series tells the story of Miep Gies (Bel Powley), a Dutch woman who was the secretary to Otto Frank (Liev Schreiber), the father of Anne Frank (Billie Boullet), during World War II. Premiering with two back-to-back episodes, the series follows Gies and her husband whose lives changed when they agreed to help hide the Frank family -- and four other individuals -- over the course of two years.
Tuesday
LIFE BELOW ZERO: FIRST ALASKANS 8 p.m. on NGC. This unscripted series, a spinoff of the Emmy Award-winning series "Life Below Zero," follows Indigenous Alaskans as they survive and thrive in one of the most remote landscapes on Earth. In the show's second season, the cast stays true to the traditions passed down from generations of Alaska Natives while adapting to 21st-century technology and advancements.
COUPLES RETREAT 9 p.m. on MTV. Celebrity couples head to Las Vegas for the third season of this MTV reality series, in which they will challenge their relationships with the help of some unconventional experts. The couples, who range from R&B legends to "Real Housewives of Atlanta" alums, break out of their comfort zones in a series of adrenaline-fueled activities like zip-lining, cattle herding and wilderness training.
1000% ME: GROWING UP MIXED 9 p.m. on HBO. The Emmy Award-winning producer and comedian W. Kamau Bell explores the joys and challenges of growing up mixed-race in this hourlong compilation of interviews with multiracial children in the Bay Area. Topics like casual racism, microaggressions and the pressure to pick a side are all fair game, as is a chipper rundown of the interviewees' favorite animals and weekend hobbies.
Wednesday
NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007) 10:17 p.m. on MAX. Joel and Ethan Coen "combine virtuosic dexterity with mischievous high spirits" in their film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name, writes A.O. Scott in his review for The New York Times. This neo-western thriller, which won the Oscar for best picture, follows three men entangled in a drug deal gone awry in 1980 West Texas. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, a "deadpan sociopath with a funny haircut." Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is a jaded sheriff, trailing the detritus Chigurh leaves behind. Both are following Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), "the human center of the film, the guy you root for." Scott promises you will be "jangled, stunned," and "completely and ecstatically absorbed."
Thursday
GUNGA DIN (1939) 3:30 p.m. on TCM. "All movies should be like the first twenty-five and the last thirty minutes of 'Gunga Din,"' wrote Benjamin Crisler in his review for The Times. This classic adventure film, which pulls elements from Rudyard Kipling's 1890 poem by the same name, follows three British sergeants in colonial India (Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) who fight a murderous cult, with the titular Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) as their guide. The film was deemed culturally significant by the Library of Congress in 1999 and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
Friday
THE ARTICULATE HOUR 9 p.m. on PBS. This three-part mini-series features the journalist Jim Cotter in conversation with poets, musicians, neuroscientists and historians on a variety of topics. The first episode delves into the concept of human memory, while the second explores our contrasting needs for community and solitude.
Saturday
FREE CHOL SOO LEE 8 p.m. on PBS. For Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage month, PBS's Emmy Award-winning anthology series, "Independent Lens," presents a documentary about Chol Soo Lee, a Korean immigrant who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1973. Though he is ultimately exonerated, this "isn't an uplifting movie," wrote Ben Kenigsberg in his review for The Times, as the documentary follows Lee on his troubled post-prison journey. "Just because Lee was innocent doesn't mean he was perfect," Kenigsberg writes.
Sunday
MTV MOVIE & TV AWARDS 8 p.m. on MTV. The actress Drew Barrymore will host this year's awards show, where a number of film and television stars will be recognized for their work -- among them Jennifer Coolidge ("The White Lotus"), the 2023 winner of the Comedic Genius Award, which will be presented to her at the event.
THE 2010s 9 p.m. on CNN. This seven-part series, from Emmy Award-winning executive producers Tom Hanks, Gary Goetzman and Mark Herzog, examines the last decade influenced by Instagram, the former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, marriage equality and the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, before culminating with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Full text: These shows examine breaking news in the style industry, the place of clothing in pop culture, and the forces that shape what we wear.
Fashion, being a visual medium with a relatively niche audience, may not appear to be the most conducive subject matter for a podcast. But in a peak podcast era, where there seems to be a show for everything, style has no shortage of audio content.
These six shows approach style from a variety of perspectives, exploring breaking news from the fashion industry, the place of clothing in pop culture, and the historical and societal forces that shape what we wear.
'Every Outfit'
"Every Outfit" started life as a sharp-tongued Instagram account deconstructing the notoriously fabulous fashion worn by the core cast members of "Sex and the City," both on and offscreen. Having amassed a dedicated following, Chelsea Fairless and Lauren Garroni created this spinoff podcast in 2021, where they apply their brand of snarky-yet-loving fashion policing to a much broader range of topics, analyzing pop culture news and trends through the lens of what was worn. Fairless, a social media consultant and designer, and Garroni, a writer and director, share a dryly witty repartee. On recent episodes they have tackled the aesthetics of the teen survival drama "Yellowjackets," Gwyneth Paltrow's much-discussed ski trial style, and the "ludicrously capacious" Burberry bag that gained infamy in the Season 4 premiere of "Succession."
Starter episode: "On Gwyneth's Trial, Capacious Bags, Lana Del Rey"
'Dressed: The History of Fashion'
Historians have long studied clothing to understand the economics, values and belief systems of cultures, and this richly researched podcast takes the same approach. Hosted by two fashion historians, Cassidy Zachary and April Calahan, each episode of "Dressed" delves into an aspect of style through the ages, with subjects that include the history of Black dandyism, the connection of fashion and politics during the French Revolution, and the story of the pioneering designer Elizabeth Hawes, who was ahead of her time decrying the industry's mistreatment of women. With a back catalog of more than 300 episodes, this series is a treasure trove.
Starter episode: "A Dressed Guide to Dressed, Part 1"
'Articles of Interest'
"99% Invisible," the long-running radio show-turned-podcast, considers the hidden or unappreciated role of design in our everyday lives, often focusing on architecture and physical structures. "Articles of Interest," hosted by Avery Trufelman, started out as a clothing-focused mini-series within "99% Invisible" but spun off into an independent series about how clothing design both mirrors and shapes society. Now in its fourth season, the show has examined gender constructs within clothing, the surprisingly complex history of Hawaiian shirts, and Cher Horowitz's iconic closet in "Clueless" (more specifically, the question of why it doesn't exist in the real world yet). Last year, the show debuted its first mini-series, "American Ivy," on the perennial popularity of the preppy look. Preppy style, which evolved from Ivy League style, favors neat and understated staples -- Oxford shirts, chinos, blazers -- and has become so ubiquitous that it's now, to quote Trufelman, "not the clothing of a subculture ... but the clothing of the dominant culture." That provides plenty of fodder for the insightful seven-part deep dive that follows.
Starter episode: "Pockets"
'Pop Fashion'
Begun in 2014, this weekly fashion podcast offers a rare blend of down-to-earth comedy and sartorial commentary. With a stated aim of appealing to industry insiders and outsiders alike, Lisa Rowan. a finance writer, and Kaarin Vembar, a fashion journalist, talk fashion news, breaking down what's happening with retailers, designers and celebrity labels, as well as on the runway and the red carpet. As hosts, Rowan and Vembar are well-informed, but never in a way that feels alienating to novices. And the range of subjects makes for enjoyably unpredictable listening: In a given episode, you might hear about Estée Lauder buying Tom Ford, how the pandemic affected retail worker pay, or the extraordinary story of the biggest diamond heist in world history.
Starter episode: "Fashion Inferno"
'The Debrief'
The Business of Fashion, which started life as a Typepad blog in 2007, has grown into a resource for news and analysis within the fashion industry. Its accompanying podcast has found similar success, with Imran Amed, its chief executive and founder, delivering coverage geared toward fashion creatives and executives. But it's not the most accessible entry point for non-insiders, which is where "The Debrief" comes in. Hosted by Lauren Sherman, the former chief correspondent for The Business of Fashion, this shorter-lived weekly show offered deep dives into more mainstream fashion subjects, like the much-exaggerated downfall of skinny jeans, the rise of direct-to-consumer clothing, and how Gen Z is reshaping the industry as both consumers and employees. "The Debrief" wrapped up its run in January when Sherman departed BoF, but the back catalog is well worth the delve for anyone seeking a better understanding of modern fashion.
Starter episode: "The Decline of the Skinny Jean"
'Who What Wear With Hillary Kerr'
"Who What Wear" was one of the first digital-only fashion brands, founded in 2006 by the former Elle magazine editors Hillary Kerr and Katherine Power, and in the years since the duo have launched clothing lines, a media company and written books on style. In May 2021 came the brand's first podcast, offering trend analysis, runway coverage and interviews with designers, stylists and celebrities. Kerr, who also leads "Second Life," a podcast about career pivots, is a warm and affable host whose interviews go deeper than many others in the genre. The show is also an especially smart resource for anyone curious about Hollywood costuming; interviewees have included designers from "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," "Daisy Jones & the Six" and the original "Gossip Girl."
Starter episode: "WWW 100: Your Definitive (and Exhaustive) Guide to Spring Shopping"

A Writer Resets After a Broken Wrist: [Style Desk]

Full text: A fall at a roller rink means a novelist has to write in longhand.
I'm 33 years old and three White Claws deep, teetering on roller skates at a rink in the San Fernando Valley. Laser light shows cut the wood floor to colored pieces. A D.J. plays Cindy Lauper. Families hold hands and dance, daisy-chained. From time to time, my husband laps me, skating fast and gracefully, a beatific look on his face.
When we laced up, he said, "You've done this before, right?"
"Totally," I slurred.
I was lying. I had never rollerskated before. I grew up Rollerblading. How different could it be?
Now, halfway around the rink, my center of balance soaked in alcohol and panic, I know I've made a grave mistake. I cling to the railing, edge toward the exit and the group of friends who wait there in brightly colored bell-bottoms and feathered hair, teased for the occasion. It's a birthday party, you see. A 40th birthday party. "Whose going to break a bone tonight?" I heard someone cackle when we arrived, a joke I chalked up less to the perils of skating than to the birthday boy's age.
The exit is now within reach. I let go of the railing. Flail my arms to propel myself toward the door. Safety, I swim for it. Then, with a slip of my skates, I fall.
When my left wrist hits the wood, my whole weight follows and the crowd makes a sucking noise, gasping all the air from the room. Nausea waves through me, and I swallow, hard. I know I've messed up.
I remain on my back for a moment, absorbing the pain, the mortification. Then, slowly, I crawl toward the exit. Someone helps me stand. "You OK?" they say. "That looked really bad." I say yes, I'm fine, and I hide my hand behind my back.
"This can't be happening to me," I wail once I'm alone with my husband and free to emote.
We're in the car and he's telling me to hold my hand over my head.
"It's broken," he says. "No question."
But it can't be broken because I have a book to write. Yes, the same book I've been trying to write for over a year. The novel about the Instagram model and her plastic surgery, a novel that deals with what everyone says is an "ambitious subject." It's hard to write about perfection, they warn, hard to humanize the people paid to perform it. But I know a thing or two about wanting to be perfect. So I persist, punish myself each time I fail. I have to get it right. I don't have a choice.
In the Northridge E.R., a TV flashes a news story from China. Bodies in bags, people in masks. A ship full of disease that can't dock. It's late February 2020.
A nurse leads my husband and me to a curtained examining room, and 20 minutes later, the orthopedic surgeon arrives, wearing a white coat stained with what appears to be mustard.
"You've broken your wrist in two places, and you've got two options," he tells me. "No. 1, we take you straight to surgery. No. 2, we reset the bone manually, put you in a cast and hope for the best."
"Which one's cheaper?" I ask.
He prepares an elaborate sling that hangs from a bar on the ceiling. "I love a manual reset," he says. "It's the old-fashioned way."
When he leaves to gather more supplies, I turn to my husband, make a face. "You want the guy who does this day in and day out," he says. "You don't have to like him."
The doctor returns with what looks like a glove made of finger puppets. He puts it on my hand, clips it to the ceiling bar, wrestles my arm into the sling. When he wrenches my broken wrist, placing his foot on my gurney for leverage, I yell.
"We've got a screamer!" he says to my husband and winks. "We've got a wild one!"
Wild is not how I identify. Careful, studious, a Type A personality with some leeway for drunken birthday parties, that's me. Rigid, yes, sometimes also me. Controlling. Perfectionistic. I started counting calories at age 12 and managed to stop after getting help when I was 19. But the counting picked up again a few years later, when my mother died after a decade of surgeries and complications. Some years after that, when my husband's mother died by suicide after a decade of mental health crises and psychiatric ward stays, the counting became a deafening noise. The only time I found peace was when I was writing. I don't like helplessness, I don't like hospitals. For all the obvious reasons.
"We're going to have to figure out a way for me to help you," my husband says once I am home on the couch, with my cast propped on a stack of pillows.
It is not the short wrist cast I had envisioned. Rather, it begins at the shoulder, hinges at the elbow, tightens at the wrist and weighs several pounds. Beneath it, pain beats in time with my heart. But I won't take the pills. The ones my mother took to die, the ones that took her away from me, made her mean, changed her brain. The ones my husband's mother swallowed every day, an addiction she couldn't shake, to all the same results. Meanness, disconnection, death. I'd rather feel the hurting, the yearning for it to stop.
Days pass, the pain subsides and the cast takes on a personality. A cumbersome agent of change. My husband brings me food, and where at first I hate that I can't prepare it myself, count every calorie that makes its way onto the plate, there's nothing I can do but accept my frustration and eat.
He buys stencils and stickers, and we bedazzle my plaster arm until it glitters gold. He wraps me in a rubber sleeve before every shower. He stands behind me in the mirror and I talk him through the basic anatomy of a ponytail, how to gather my hair, how to fasten it with a plastic band. He brings me reams of yellow legal pads. Within a week, I'm at my desk, cast in a sling, grateful that the fall took my left wrist rather than my right. Small mercies.
Writing longhand is slow work. But the time it takes to make a sentence produces a certain lyricism, and the plot I once resisted becomes the plot I embrace. I'm still writing, still wearing the cast, when the world goes into a lockdown.
Helplessness, uncertainty, fear. A season of loss and letting go. The calorie-counting subsides, then surges, then subsides. The virus does the same. When finally the cast comes off, my arm has the appearance of a newborn, soft and not yet of this world. Fingers free, I transcribe the novel I wrote by hand into my computer. I revise, revise again, choose words, punctuation, images with care. Here, a question mark. Here, a heart. Here, a new world for my character to walk through.
Episode is a column chronicling a moment in a writer's life. Allie Rowbottom is the author of the novel "Aesthetica" and the family memoir "Jell-O Girls."

Full text: After tennis, swimming and some time in the sauna, Peter Gelb and Keri-Lynn Wilson work at their adjoining desks.
Married for 18 years, Keri-Lynn Wilson and Peter Gelb spend a lot of time apart because of their high-profile careers. Ms. Wilson, 55, is a conductor with gigs all over the world. Mr. Gelb, 69, is the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.
Even when they are together on the occasional Sunday, work has a way of interfering: While Ms. Wilson prepares for her next maestro engagement, Mr. Gelb is on call for whatever needs doing at the Met, including scrambling to find a replacement if a singer cancels just before a matinee. Sometimes they collaborate: They are currently working on a concert tour of the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra. Ms. Wilson, who will conduct, had the idea for the performances after Russia invaded Ukraine last year.
What follows is a typical weekend for the couple when they are both at home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where they live in a duplex, blocks away from the Met.
SOPHISTICATED AND LUXURIOUS Mr. Gelb: I get up between 6 and 6:30. My wife is still sleeping at that point, so I pad down the stairs and start my morning off with a cappuccino with two shots of espresso and skim milk. I have a banana and a vitamin C energy drink, and then I do some early morning phone calls to European colleagues who are awake, answer some of last night's emails and check the box office report. Ms. Wilson: I typically get up around 7:30. I try to get a good night's rest. For 25 years, my career has meant living out of suitcases and hotels. If I've been on the road a bit, sometimes I confuse the hot and cold taps in the apartment.
SCORES, ON AND OFF THE COURT Mr. Gelb: I usually get an Uber to make sure I catch the 8:20 tram to Roosevelt Island in time for my 8:30-to-10 tennis match at the Roosevelt Island Racquet Club. On my way to tennis I always send Keri-Lynn messages wishing her a good morning. She's the only person in the world I send emojis to. Ms. Wilson: I came to New York when I was 18 to go to Juilliard. New York has always been special to me. But unfortunately when I'm here I'm usually sitting at my desk with a score. I'll have my coffee, watch BBC News, have my breakfast of fruit and cereal and yogurt, and then I'll go right to work.
WATER IN THE BASEMENT Mr. Gelb: By the time I get back to the apartment, Keri-Lynn is doing her daily routine of 30 minutes of swimming. Ms. Wilson: Every single day I swim. We live in a very old building, and the swimming pool in the basement was a major factor in our decision to live here. As a conductor, my body is my machine. Mr. Gelb: It's an ancient lap pool. In the early 20th century, Isadora Duncan used the area it's in to rehearse with her dancers.
HOT AND COLD Mr. Gelb: We meet for our first communal activity of the day, a sauna and a steam. We have a sauna and a separate steam room in the apartment. Ms. Wilson: I would add that I'm part Icelandic, and there's a great Scandinavian tradition of heat contrasted with ice-cold. We always finish with a super cold shower. Mr. Gelb: Then we have a very light lunch, sort of on the fly. Ms. Wilson: We'll have a hard-boiled egg. We don't even sit down. We'll stand at our tall counter. Then I get back to my desk.
COLLABORATING Mr. Gelb: We have next to the kitchen a long, narrow office with two adjoining desks. Usually we're both in there working. In the case of a project like the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra, I fill in Keri-Lynn on dates that have come in from our organizers, and she'll tell me about the repertoire she's planning. Ms. Wilson: Putting together a project like this with Peter, who is so brilliant, it wasn't even daunting. It doesn't even feel like work.
PIANO ESCAPE Mr. Gelb: We have a music room that has a Steinway baby concert grand, where she also studies her scores. Ms. Wilson: When Peter gets on the phone, that's where I escape.
THE WORK Mr. Gelb: Some Sundays, there's a matinee. If it starts at 3, I'll get there around 2:30 to say hello to the artists and the conductor. And if there are any important patrons to say hello to, I will do that. If I've seen the performance several times already, I will go in and out of my office, about 50 yards away from a secret entrance to the general manager's box. Ms. Wilson: While Peter's at the matinee, I will still be at my desk. I have perfect pitch, so I can look at a page and hear the notes in my head without having to play them. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time to read through a score. Just once takes several hours. And then you keep going through it. There's so many aspects you have to understand: the structure, the dynamics, the phrasing.
SANCTUARY Ms. Wilson: I will finally get away to walk in Central Park, my sanctuary. As much as I like to think I'm relaxing, I'm still studying music. Sometimes I'm listening on my headphones, sometimes I just think about it. I adore looking at Sheep Meadow, that skyline. Many times I'll record a video message for my cousin in Ukraine. I speak a lot of languages, but I feel very insecure that I don't speak Ukrainian fluently yet. My best friend who taught me Russian is teaching me Ukrainian.
DINNER FOR TWO Mr. Gelb: I'm the cook. I'll make fish and vegetables, with the fish probably from Citarella. It's healthy, too healthy. If I'm craving pasta, I'll make something for Keri-Lynn and I might make myself spaghetti with clam sauce. Ms. Wilson: Like I said, I treat my body like a machine. I feel like I have more energy if I avoid pasta. While Peter's doing his dinner prep, I like to play the piano.
COCKTAIL HOUR Ms. Wilson: Once he's prepped, I like to say, "Peter, can we sit down and have a cocktail?" Mr. Gelb: Keri-Lynn will have a glass of Champagne. I like to have iced vodka.
COMPETITION Mr. Gelb: We might play Scrabble, too. I think I have a larger English vocabulary than she does, but she's a much more talented Scrabble player. Ms. Wilson: I've occasionally ended up getting a word worth 98 points. Mr. Gelb: I find that very demoralizing.
ROLL INTO BED Mr. Gelb: I'm in bed by 11:30, midnight at the latest. Ms. Wilson: I go to bed a little later, maybe 1 or so. I have a wonderful physical therapist who showed me how ballerinas use rollers to stretch out their back muscles. You can use the roller in other ways, too, for all sorts of core exercises. I like to spend 15 minutes doing that before bed. It's like an extra little workout.
Sunday Routine readers can follow Ms. Wilson on Twitter and Instagram at @Kerilynnwilsonmaestro. Mr. Gelb is not on social media.

Interest Builds Over Bluesky, A Social Site Akin to Twitter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Some Twitter users are rushing to join Bluesky, a social platform funded by Jack Dorsey, a founder of Twitter.
The buzz this week around Bluesky, a new social media platform being called Twitter 2.0, has been intense. Prominent Twitter users such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, and the model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen have joined. Thousands of others are begging for invitations to it.
Some Twitter users have been looking for an alternative social platform since Elon Musk bought the company last year and then changed the service. Bluesky's users say the app -- which was funded by a Twitter founder, Jack Dorsey -- has come the closest to mimicking Twitter's tone and feel.
Here's what to know about it.
What is Bluesky?
Bluesky is a social network that offers many of the same core features that Twitter does. Users can post short text and photo updates, reply to each other and share other people's posts.
The app, which is still in development, became available for iOS devices in February and for Android devices this month.
How is Bluesky different from Twitter?
Jay Graber, Bluesky's chief executive, said in a blog post last month that it was no coincidence that the app looked like Twitter. But unlike Twitter, Bluesky plans to be a decentralized system, meaning people may eventually be able to build their own apps and communities within it. Ms. Graber said it was designed that way so that no individual could create rules for the entire Bluesky community.
Bluesky also operates using an "open protocol." This is unusual because social media platforms have traditionally been walled gardens, meaning that what is posted on individual platforms remains only on that platform. For instance, your tweets show up on Twitter and your photos show up on Instagram, but they cannot be easily cross-posted across those social networks.
But because Bluesky is trying to be more open, it could someday allow posts to flow between different social media platforms with ease.
Last month, a Bluesky user speculated that the app's name came from Mr. Dorsey's desire to transform Twitter into an open protocol, freeing Twitter's bird mascot to a blue sky. Mr. Dorsey responded, "Yes."
How do you join Bluesky?
With Bluesky still under development, it is currently invitation only. The app is building moderation tools before opening up to the general public, Ms. Graber said in a post on the platform last month. To sign up, people need an invitation code from a current user.
Why has Bluesky become popular?
Since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, he has changed the service by removing restrictions around online speech on the platform and changing its verification practices. Those have led to some user confusion, as well as to an increase in misinformation and hate speech on the platform.
As a result, Twitter users have tested out alternatives. In recent months, some have migrated to Mastodon, another decentralized social media platform that has said it aims to be "a viable alternative to Twitter."
Bluesky was originally limited to a small group of tech insiders. On Thursday, several prominent Twitter accounts and public figures -- such as Ms. Ocasio Cortez, Ms. Teigen and the social media star Dril -- joined the platform, creating buzz around it.
Bluesky's users appear to be having fun with the app's similarities to Twitter, including calling posts on the app "skeets," as a play on tweets. Not even a plea from Ms. Graber on Thursday to change that name seems to have deterred them.

Full text: Miss the Red Cat, in Chelsea? We have just the place.
As spring marched forward and cherry blossom petals covered city sidewalks, you filled our inbox with questions both practical and highly specific. One reader is searching for wheelchair-friendly dining. Another is looking for a replacement for a beloved restaurant -- I found the perfect spot -- and a third asked for recommendations in Upper Manhattan for the "one million people in Westchester," as the reader put it.
As always, email me at wheretoeat@nytimes.com with your questions or advice, and you may see your message featured here.
Dining With A.D.A.-Accessible Accommodations
My husband recently started using a wheelchair. Before his illness, we enjoyed eating excellent food ranging from luxurious to neighborhood. He especially likes excellent sushi. Please tell us great places to go that are wheelchair accessible (including the bathroom!). -- Ellen C.
The excellent Peruvian restaurant Contento in Harlem immediately springs to mind. Two of its owners use wheelchairs, so the space has been outfitted accordingly. (And if your husband loves sushi, the ceviche will hit the spot.) If you want luxurious sushi, Yoshino, a restaurant in NoHo that Pete Wells awarded four stars last year, is accessible and has a counter at wheelchair height.
Finally there's Fulgurances Laundromat, where rotating resident chefs showcase their talents with a six-course tasting menu for $ 89 ( $ 149 with wine pairings). The nearby Greenpoint Avenue subway stop is A.D.A.-accessible, and the restaurant has an entrance ramp and a wheelchair-accessible bathroom. Through April 29, the resident chef is Flor Camorlinga, who mixes elements of Japanese, Korean and European cooking with food rooted in her native Mexico. And because the menu changes every few months, this is a restaurant you can revisit as you find your way to a new but no less delicious normal.
Tracking Down a Chef
The Red Cat was recommended to us by Ina Garten. Sadly, it closed after the owner wanted a fresh start -- good for him, but bad for us. Can you recommend a similar restaurant? We like the neighborhood vibe without loud music or TVs. -- Kathy H.
It's so rare that I'm able to find a near-perfect answer for a question, but Kathy, wait until you see what I came up with! Some background: The Red Cat was a popular American restaurant in Chelsea that closed in 2018 after nearly 20 years in business. As this reader points out, the chef and owner, Jimmy Bradley, decided to take a break. We could all learn something from Jimmy.
The first place that came to mind was Motel Morris, a chic, New American restaurant, also in Chelsea, where the music is of the soothing soul variety (think Nina Simone and Stevie Wonder). And wouldn't you know it, the restaurant's executive chef is one Bill McDaniel, who spent 14 years as the chef de cuisine at the Red Cat. Ta da! Go for the red curry mussels at dinner, or the Gruyère-smothered, open-faced Reuben at lunch.
Dinner Near 125th Street
For the one million people in Westchester, where can we drive down for a great meal in New York City but not have to go below 125th Street? I have a place for Dominican chicken on Broadway and 177th Street. But what else? -- Betsy T.
First, please tell me the name of your Dominican chicken place. I hope you don't mind that my recommendations are below 125th Street -- but only by a few blocks. You'll find one in an earlier answer (Contento). And for the second, my dear colleague Eric Kim lives in Upper Manhattan and has always loved Massawa, the 35-year-old Ethiopian and Eritrean restaurant between 120th and 121st Streets. I trust Eric's tastes completely and you should, too. He says to order the cabbage and potatoes; the salmon; and any of the vegan options, like the tsebhi hamli, collard greens stewed with tomatoes and berbere.
In Other News ...
There's no restaurant review this week, but here's Pete Wells's list of the city's 100 best restaurants in case you missed it.
Openings: Ma-dé, "a Balinese beach party" of a restaurant from the Wayan team, is now open on Spring Street; Jupiter at Rockefeller Center has added Jupiter Pasta & Wine Terrace, serving cocktails and small plates; and Little Egg, a spinoff of the restaurant Egg (closed), is now open in Prospect Heights.
Priya Krishna has a vibrant report on Corona Plaza in Queens, where Latin American food sellers have created "one of the only markets in New York spearheaded and operated by local vendors," she writes.
Through interviews with dozens of former employees and local restaurant veterans, Julia Moskin reported on allegations of workplace abuse and harassment against Barbara Lynch, one of Boston's most celebrated chefs and restaurateurs.
Tejal Rao wrote about Los Angeles's ever-growing and ever-delicious doughnut scene.

Web Search Sparks Sales For Alphabet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google's parent company returned to sales growth, even as an advertising slowdown continued to crimp YouTube.
After years of easy financial growth and booming popularity, Alphabet, Google's parent company, has in recent months faced mounting questions about its future. It has been under the gun to deliver artificial intelligence technology, its sales growth has decelerated, and it is laying off 12,000 employees to cut costs.
On Tuesday, Google shrugged off some of those questions, returning to sales growth in defiance of a slowdown in digital advertising.
The company reported revenue of $ 69.8 billion in the first three months of 2023, up 3 percent from a year earlier and beating analysts' average estimate of $ 68.9 billion. Its profits fell 8 percent, to $ 15 billion -- the fifth consecutive decline -- though Alphabet said it recorded $ 2.6 billion in charges related to recent layoffs and office space reductions.
Google still faces significant challenges. Its video platform, YouTube, continues to be crimped by the ad slump and rival Microsoft has gained buzz and users after incorporating an A.I. chatbot into its search engine, Bing.
But Tuesday's results highlighted Google's enviable advantage as a gateway to the web for billions of people around the world, a position that cannot be dislodged quickly or easily.
In particular, Google's search engine, the core of the world's largest digital advertising machine, remained strong. Revenue from the search engine rose almost 2 percent. to $ 40.4 billion, in the first quarter, higher than analysts' estimates of $ 39.4 billion. The company said travel firms and retailers had spent more to reach customers on the search platform.
Sante Faustini, who runs product intelligence at M Science, a data research firm, said in an interview that Google's search engine was the driving force of the company's rebound, in a sign of the service's "resilience" against larger economic forces.
Starting last year, rising interest rates and inflation had made advertisers thriftier, undermining the sales and profit of Google and its peers Snap and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. Google's sales had declined slightly at the end of last year.
That had put Alphabet under growing pressure to reassure investors it could still deliver revenue and profit gains, after years of gravity-defying leaps. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, encapsulated Wall Street's demands in a recent note, in which he pushed the company to shed expenses, stabilize core businesses including YouTube and accelerate the release of artificial intelligence technology.
The internet giant said in January it would cull 12,000 people, or 6 percent, of its global work force, from its payroll. As of March 31, Alphabet had 190,711 employees, compared with 190,234 at the end of last year. The company's layoffs did not officially go into effect until the end of last month.
At the same time, Google's search engine appeared threatened by a wave of chatbots that have captured the public imagination. In particular, tools from Microsoft and OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, have begun testing Google's mettle.
In March, Google released a chatbot called Bard to mixed reviews, but the company does not generate revenue from the tool. The New York Times has reported that Google will incorporate conversational A.I. features into its flagship search engine in May, and has begun work on a new, more personalized search engine designed to take advantage of A.I. advances.
Last week, Alphabet consolidated its main A.I. teams into one unit, Google DeepMind, to make quicker progress in the field. The move combined the London-based A.I. lab DeepMind with Google Brain, part of the company's research division. DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, assumed control of the group. Jeff Dean, Google's top research executive, had previously overseen Google Brain, which he co-founded.
In an earnings call on Tuesday, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive, said the company had made "good progress" in A.I., comparing it to the company's transition from desktop to mobile computing more than a decade ago.
"Our investments and breakthroughs in A.I. over the last decade have positioned us well," he said, while promising a raft of new A.I. features in everything from Android smartphones to software for other businesses. He added that he hoped Google's efforts to develop A.I. features would help the company retain its large user base.
"We'll continue to incorporate generative A.I. advances to make search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way," he said.
Advertising sales at YouTube, Google's video platform, dipped almost 3 percent, to $ 6.7 billion, in the first quarter, narrowly ahead of the $ 6.6 billion expected by analysts. The division has recorded declining revenue in recent months amid increased competition from TikTok. Apple's privacy changes for its iPhones have also tamped down the growth of social media platforms by making it more difficult to prove to advertisers that their ads are effective.
Sales at Google Cloud, the division that offers software and technology services to other businesses, jumped 28 percent to $ 7.5 billion. For the first quarter, the division reported a profit for the first time, of $ 191 million.

2 Anheuser-Busch Executives on Leave After Bud Light Promotion With Transgender Influencer: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Anheuser-Busch announced the moves after a conservative backlash over its association with the actress and social media personality Dylan Mulvaney.
The maker of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch, said on Tuesday that two of its executives were on a leave of absence after the beer was featured in a social media promotion by a transgender influencer.
Bud Light's sales have slumped amid calls for a boycott because of the advertisement and criticism of the company's response to the backlash, which included targeted harassment of one of the executives who is on leave.
Alissa Heinerscheid, the vice president of marketing for Bud Light, and Daniel Blake, who oversees marketing for Anheuser-Busch's mainstream brands, were on leave, the company said in a statement.
"We have made some adjustments to streamline the structure of our marketing function to reduce layers so that our most senior marketers are more closely connected to every aspect of our brands' activities," Anheuser-Busch said in a statement. "These steps will help us maintain focus on the things we do best: brewing great beer for all consumers, while always making a positive impact in our communities and on our country."
The company's turmoil began on April 1, when a transgender influencer, Dylan Mulvaney, posted a video on her Instagram account to promote a Bud Light March Madness contest to her 1.8 million followers. In her post, which was less than a minute long, she said that the company had sent her a tallboy can of Bud Light with her face on it. An image of the can was edited into the video.
Within days, conservative celebrities and politicians called for a boycott of the brand. These calls were then followed by calls for a reverse boycott, or buycott, encouraging people to buy Bud Light to show support for the marketing.
Brendan Whitworth, the chief executive of Anheuser-Busch InBev, indirectly addressed the controversy in a statement on April 14.
"We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people," he said. "We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer."
This did not subdue the criticisms of Bud Light, which grew to include complaints about its tepid response to the backlash, as well as the targeted harassment of Ms. Heinerscheid.
Critics of the advertisement with Ms. Mulvaney had found a podcast interview from March in which Ms. Heinerscheid said that some of Bud Light's previous advertisements had "fratty, sort of out-of-touch humor" and that the company would need to be more inclusive for its demographic to grow. As the podcast quotes circulated, The Daily Caller, The New York Post and The Daily Mail published photos of Ms. Heinerscheid at a party in college in 2006.
Ms. Heinerscheid and Mr. Blake could not immediately be reached for comment.
News of the executives' leaves began circulating after a report about Ms. Heinerscheid on Friday in Beer Business Daily, a trade publication, and another about her superior, Mr. Blake, on Sunday in The Wall Street Journal.
The controversy has had a negative effect on Bud Light's sales, which dropped 17 percent in the week ending on April 15, Beer Business Daily said.
In the United States, the beer industry is dominated by two large brewers that control 65 percent of beer sales: the Molson Coors Beverage Company, which owns well-known brands including Coors and Miller, and Anheuser-Busch InBev, which also owns Corona and Michelob.
A little more than 20 years ago, beer accounted for about half of alcohol sales in the country. Last year, that market share was about 42 percent, as sales of gin, vodka and other spirits have grown sharply in recent years.
Anheuser-Busch, which has introduced nonalcoholic and canned cocktail drinks, reported that its beer sales in North America fell 4 percent last year.
Bump Williams, who runs an alcoholic beverage consulting firm, said he was becoming concerned that the Bud Light controversy could result in a negative "halo effect" around Anheuser-Busch's other brands, many of which did see small dips in sales.
Harry Schuhmacher, the publisher of Beer Business Daily, said that as Bud Light sales have fallen, they rose almost dollar for dollar for its competitors Miller Lite and Coors Light.
Mr. Schuhmacher said that the situation was "terrible" in the short-term for Bud Light, but it was likely to have less of an effect on the company's long-term business because the brand was already in decline. "This just steepens that curve of decline that was already happening," he said.
He said that the popularity of different beer brands tends to vary by generation and Bud Light is experiencing the slump in that cycle.
"It's been going on since Prohibition was repealed," he said. "And brands cycle through about every 20 to 30 years."
He said that there could be a "silver lining" for the company since the controversy has attracted so much attention from the media.
"They seemingly took a stand although they didn't really back it up that well," Mr. Schuhmacher said. "They threw it out there and hid, which I think is unfair to Dylan and unfair to the trans community a little bit."
The criticism of Bud Light arose as Republican state lawmakers are proposing legislation that seeks to regulate the lives of young transgender people, restrict drag shows in a way that could broadly encompass performances by transgender people, and require schools to out transgender students to their parents.
Ms. Mulvaney has been documenting her transition on TikTok, where she has more than 10.8 million followers. In March, she celebrated one year of her "Days of Girlhood" series.
Anheuser-Busch said earlier this month that it "works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics" and gave Ms. Mulvaney a personalized can with her face on it to "celebrate a personal milestone."
Ms. Mulvaney has not responded to the Bud Light uproar, but she addressed the hostility she has faced in an interview on the "Onward With Rosie O'Donnell" podcast that was released amid the backlash. She is "an easy target," she said, "because I'm still new to this."

The Donut Hole, in La Puente, doesn’t sell the very best doughnuts in the Los Angeles area, but I love going there. Driving through its absurd, gigantic fiberglass doughnut — a pristine example of mimetic architecture — is a brief, giddy and almost spiritual experience. It is half the joy of being there, and it gives the doughnuts a bit of an edge.
An edge, architectural or otherwise, is practically required in the unusually saturated, competitive doughnut market of Southern California.
A shop’s extra attraction might be the availability of lottery tickets or Vietnamese sandwiches alongside properly crunchy, darkly fried old-fashioneds, as at Pronto Donuts in Monterey Park. It might be a glamorous seasonal doughnut, like the strawberry-stuffed beasts you can find at the Donut Man, in Glendora, from February to September.
I am consistently pleased by the simple chocolate glazed at Colorado Donuts — though if I’m with my nephews, the chewy, pull-apart, rainbow-colored mochi doughnuts from Mochi Dochi are always the stronger choice.
Alone, I will happily drive 45 minutes out of the way to Oliboli, in Tustin, for the Meyer lemon-glazed doughnut, and the singular ham-and-cheese-filled doughnut with its finely bubbled surface and sweetly perfumed center, made from a dough raised slowly over 40 hours. If I’m anywhere near a Sidecar Doughnuts location, I have to go in and get one of whatever happens to be just out of the fryer, so recently garnished that the glaze is still wet to the touch.
Southern California is rich in small, local chains and independent shops, including many owned by first- and second-generation Cambodian immigrants, like the 24-hour California Donuts, which fries custom, bubbly-letter-shaped doughnuts that can spell a phrase — a consistently delightful item to bring to a party, depending on the message you choose.
The 2020 documentary “The Donut King,” by filmmaker Alice Gu, told the story of Southern California’s distinctive doughnut industry through Ted Ngoy, a Cambodian refugee who arrived here in 1975 and went on to build an empire — becoming a multimillionaire in the process.
Ngoy, who signed up for a training program through Winchell’s Donut House in 1975, bought his first shop just a year later. By 1980, he owned 20, and started sponsoring visas for Cambodian immigrants, creating a pipeline for them directly into the booming doughnut business of the 1980s and ’90s. His legacy isn’t just in the abundance of independent doughnut shops that define the region, but also in their use of pink boxes.
Despite the concentration of the market, new shops still find cult followings. The Hawaiian company Holey Grail Donuts sells taro doughnuts fried in coconut oil, and opened its first Los Angeles-area location in December, followed by a second one last month. Run by siblings Nile and Hana Dreiling, who grew up eating potato doughnuts in Eugene, Oregon, Holey Grail started in 2018 as a small truck in Hanalei, a town on Kauai.
It’s no secret that the best doughnut is always the one fried most recently, and that after sitting in a pastry case for hours, even the best doughnut will start to deteriorate. The draw of Holey Grail, and it’s a powerful one, is that the shop fries all of its doughnuts to order.
An unhurried countertop machine drops rings of dough into hot coconut oil, flips them over as they set and color, and spits out deep golden rings that the shop workers glaze neatly with vanilla and maple, chocolate, or honey and sea salt.
Still warm, these doughnuts have slightly bubbly, wonderfully crunchy bottoms and a very gentle but satisfying chew. There is no waxy feeling at the back of your tongue from the fryer fat, no aftertaste of the oil. The doughnuts are small, crisp and barely sweet. They are packed in sleek, black boxes to go, but it’s worth eating at least one right away, while it’s at the height of its powers.
The dough is built from a base of poi — a sticky, starchy paste of boiled taro corm and water. Taro isn’t a traditional doughnut base, but it is a pillar of Hawaii’s native culture and diet — an ingredient that farmers are slowly working to bring back to Hawaiian farmland. The business buys taro paste from a handful of farms in Hawaii, most of it harvested and processed in Hanalei.
Some doughnut flavors are mainstays on the menu, while others change every week, shifting with Dreiling’s purveyors of chocolate, fruit and other ingredients. On my most recent visit there was a yuzu, strawberry and hojicha number, made in collaboration with the chef Akira Akuto of the restaurant Konbi (now-closed), as well as a tangy passion fruit, orange and guava. Groups of teenagers around me sipped elaborate drinks made with fresh nut milks as they waited, while a woman with shopping bags fielded a call from her nanny.
Holey Grail specializes in an extreme of the city’s vast and glorious doughnut scene — the luxury doughnut. But it’s not the only kind on offer here. The real beauty of doughnuts in Los Angeles is that the second you want one, wherever you are in the city, an open shop seems to appear.

Digging Into a Popular Fat-Zapping Procedure: [Science Desk]

Full text: A New York Times examination found that a popular beauty treatment may be leading to disfigurement for more patients than previously known.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In early 2022, Ethan Hauser, my editor on the Styles desk at The New York Times, approached me with a question that neither of us knew would grow into a yearlong reporting project. It was a few months after the model Linda Evangelista shared publicly that she had been disfigured by a side effect of CoolSculpting, a cosmetic treatment that promises to freeze away fat cells.
The company that manufactures CoolSculpting, Allergan Aesthetics, a unit of the pharmaceutical giant AbbVie, has repeatedly said that the side effect, known as paradoxical adipose hyperplasia, is incredibly rare, occurring in just one in every 3,000 treatments. P.A.H. results in enlarged, hardened masses of fat on the body -- almost the opposite of what CoolSculpting patients are hoping for.
Ethan's question sounded simple: If this side effect was as rare as the company estimated, wasn't it strange a famous supermodel got it? The answer was anything but.
While many publications covered the news about Ms. Evangelista, we wanted to go deeper, digging into the studies that led the Food and Drug Administration to clear the treatment, combing through Securities and Exchange Commission filings and speaking with dozens of doctors and patients. Last week, after more than a year of reporting, we published our examination of CoolSculpting. Our reporting indicates that the risk of P.A.H. to patients may be considerably higher than previously known.
I'll admit that I wasn't quite sure where to start with this project. I was a reporting fellow on the Styles desk, and I didn't have much experience with long-term investigative reporting. But it was an exciting opportunity to step outside my comfort zone -- and to finally put my information science degree to use. (My fluency with numbers would come in handy.)
Shortly after Ethan and I started looking into CoolSculpting, Kirsten Danis, an editor on the Investigations team, approached us to see how she could help. She taught me some of the basic techniques of investigative reporting, including one of my favorites, perhaps borrowed from telemarketing: "smile and dial."
I began by making phone calls, on background, to experts who study the F.D.A. regulatory process. I wanted to get a general understanding of how medical devices are brought into the marketplace.
Then I spent months reading all the documents I could find that were relevant to CoolSculpting, such as earnings reports, lawsuits and medical studies. I was looking for things that might surprise readers. For example, I learned from a 2011 S.E.C. filing that the initial F.D.A. clearance for CoolSculpting was based on a study that involved just 60 patients. Clinical studies for medical devices are often small, so this wasn't too unusual -- but to readers unfamiliar with this world, the size of the study could be interesting.
Another source of information was the lawsuits filed against the manufacturer of CoolSculpting. I learned a lot from reading court transcripts and documents. I also used the F.D.A.'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database to find patient, physician and manufacturer reports about P.A.H.
Many of the documents I obtained had redacted parts, and The Times's research team helped me track down the people who had written those correspondences. I had to learn many technical terms and the differences between them: For example, "clearance" and "approval" are two different processes at the F.D.A., with approval being more rigorous. I'd mute my computer notifications, print the documents and go through them line by line with a highlighter.
I interviewed more than a dozen doctors who said the manufacturer's estimate of the risk was lower than what they had observed in their work. I reached out to Allergan for comment, but the company declined to answer most of our questions. (In statements, Allergan maintained that P.A.H. is rare and said it was well documented in the information they provide to patients.)
To humanize the article, I also included the voices and experiences of patients. It's one thing to read about P.A.H.; it's another to see how it upended a person's life or sense of self. Ms. Evangelista, for example, wrote on Instagram that she became a "recluse" as a result of her condition.
But some people feared speaking out about their experiences because they were hoping the company would help pay for corrective surgeries, and those payments were often contingent upon patients' signing confidentiality agreements. One of the women I spoke with, Gina D'Addario, had declined the company's settlement offer. She wanted to share her story, with the hope that it would help others.
Doctors who worked on corrective surgeries connected me with patients, and I found others through Facebook support groups for people with P.A.H. I didn't want to make anyone feel pressured to participate in the article, and I tried my best to make those who came forward feel heard.
For my first big Times examination, I wasn't meeting secretive sources in parking garages late at night or eavesdropping on important conversations on a train. It did involve a lot (and I mean a lot) of reading dense documents, over and over again, and speaking with dozens of people who had seen or experienced P.A.H. firsthand.
Often, the answers I was seeking were hidden in plain sight.

Help! Spirit Airlines Left Us in Guatemala!: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A family got a text alert that their flight was delayed, but no follow-up that the delay was rescinded. Our columnist finds that the airline played by the rules, as unfair as they may seem.
Dear Tripped Up,
My two sons and I checked in at the Guatemala City airport three hours before the first leg of our return flight to Detroit. As we waited, I received two texts from Spirit announcing that our flight was delayed, first by about 20 minutes and then by an additional 15, making the new departure time 4:18 p.m. We used the delay to get something to eat, monitoring our phones for more updates, but none came. When we returned to our gate at 3:40, we were told the plane had been readied earlier than expected and the doors had closed. The gate staff said it would be three days before another flight was available, and they refused to book us on another airline. We were forced to spend over $ 3,000 for same-day, one-way tickets on JetBlue. We eventually received a partial $ 297 credit from Spirit, but we want them to reimburse us for the JetBlue flight, since they should have alerted us when the departure time was again revised. Tom, Ann Arbor, Mich.
Dear Tom,
If a doctor's office or hairstylist or friend we're planning to meet for lunch texts us that they're running 30 minutes behind, we rightfully feel free to do whatever we want with that half-hour, as long as we show up at the new time. But air travel is an alternative universe filled with odd rules and quirky customs that sometimes fly in the face of real-world logic.
Like you, had I received the same alert, I would have retreated from the crowded, germy gate area to find a restaurant or bar to while away the delay and assumed the airline would ping me if anything changed. But when I polled frequent-flying friends, several told me they would never stray far from the gate. "They always tell you not to go too far," said one wizened veteran, a consultant who flies nearly every week.
Turns out they're right and we're wrong. And Spirit has it in writing.
When I reached out to them, a spokesman for the airline, Erik Hofmeyer, sent me an initial statement noting that "key details were missing" from your story, adding that "section 2.4.1 (b) of our Contract of Carriage has some information that you may find useful."
For anyone not familiar with Spirit's terms and conditions -- which I'm guessing includes most people reading this as they wait to board a Spirit flight -- here's section 2.4.1 (b):"In the event of a delay, guests are recommended to remain in the gate area for updates and possible early departures. Spirit shall not be liable to any guest who misses a flight, which departed earlier than the estimated departure time posted for the delay."
For a moment, I thought these lines might have been written just for you ("the Tom from Ann Arbor clause"), but it turns out they were added in late 2014. Spirit is the only airline I could find whose contract is so explicit about the issue, but many note that passengers must be at the gate in advance of the originally scheduled departure time even when there is a delay.
Still, why wouldn't Spirit send another message updating you when the flight was pushed forward again? Was this a flaw in an automated system, a human mistake, or just the way things work?
Mr. Hofmeyer didn't provide details, but I did find U.S. Department of Transportation guidelines giving airlines 30 minutes to inform passengers of a change in schedule -- perhaps too late in this case -- and even then only by updating their website. Mr. Hofmeyer said that agents called your name five times over the public address system, though you say you didn't hear it.
You asked Spirit to reimburse the cost of your one-way tickets on JetBlue, noting that otherwise you would have been stuck for three more days in Guatemala. Spirit refused, and is within their rights to do so. Department of Transportation guidelines explicitly state that airlines need not book passengers on competing airlines; their next available flight is sufficient, even if it is a few days later. And the airline doesn't need to pay for your hotel, either. (Don't shoot the messenger.)
This is mostly bad news for you, but I do have some good news: You got more money back from Spirit than you originally realized. The $ 279 you received in March was actually their second payment; apparently you didn't spot a $ 457 Spirit credit to your card back in January, right after you missed your flight. Mr. Hofmeyer said that the total of $ 736 covers the full value of the legs you and your family missed. I have no way of verifying that -- it's about a third of the full price you paid for the Spirit tickets, but he did not provide a detailed breakdown. In any case, he made it clear that Spirit is not admitting any fault and that this refund is a courtesy.
Of course, a text alerting you that your departure had been moved back up would have been even better. Spirit would not comment on why you never got one, so I spoke with Suresh Acharya, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who has worked for decades on airline optimization systems. He cautioned that we should not expect all airlines to have equally deft, customer-friendly communications systems. "It may have just been a manual oversight," he said. "With Spirit or another low-cost, no-frills airline, their IT infrastructure and integration are probably not that automated."
He noted that since delays are costly to airlines, often requiring overtime payments to crews and causing delays that can ripple across the system, airlines will jump on any chance to speed up departures even after delays have already been announced, although it sometimes means leaving passengers behind. This is especially true on international flights and at domestic "slot-controlled" airports where the F.A.A. has imposed limits on takeoffs.
That said, all delays are not created equal. Mr. Acharya passed along some useful tricks he uses when traveling to better guess when a delay is going to stick, or even "creep" forward, to use frustratingly accurate airline lingo. First, he figures out where the aircraft is. If it's already at the gate, the delay might not stick if a mechanical issue can be solved faster than projected or crew members stuck in traffic arrive faster than they expected.
If the plane is not at the gate, that could indicate a more definitive or even creeping delay. Check online or ask staff where the incoming aircraft is; if it's still hours away, that's a bad sign. On the other hand, if you're at an airport that serves as the hub of the airline you're flying (Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for example, for Spirit) they might be able to switch equipment or swap crews more easily.
But I can't help thinking that there is a very simple solution Spirit could implement that would go a long way toward sparing future customers from your fate: Add one more sentence to its default alerts, urging passengers "to stay at or near the gate at all times." They could even add, "For more information, click here for the contract of carriage," giving passengers one last opportunity to avoid reading it.

Under the Bag, a Podcaster Is an Open Book: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The podcaster behind the popular "Blindboy Podcast," who earlier gained fame as part of the Rubberbandits hip-hop duo, says that covering his face lets him say things he couldn't otherwise.
The Irish podcaster David Chambers spends his days‌ in an exceptionally drab office. A room so drab it is striking. In a recent interview via Zoom, he was dressed to match, in a white T-shirt and plain black hoodie. The only noteworthy thing onscreen was ‌an orange and white plastic bag that Chambers wore over his head. His green eyes, thick eyebrows‌ and beard could be seen through the bag's holes, but the rest of his face was obscured.
Although they don't know what he looks like underneath the mask, most people in Ireland know Chambers, 37, by his pseudonym "Blindboy Boatclub," or, more often, just "Blindboy." He is best known as the host of "The Blindboy Podcast," a weekly show in which he discusses eclectic topics, like the unlikely benefits of lion urine or the link between heavy metal and futurism, and tells personal anecdotes that unspool like short stories. He addresses topics like mental health that Irish news media outlets rarely touch, and brings a millennial sensibility to political discussions. His register is earnest and intellectual, but also funny and down-to-earth.
"The Blindboy Podcast," which Chambers started in 2017, regularly attracts 700,000 to one million monthly listeners, according to Acast, the company that hosts it. Six years on, it is something of a cultural phenomenon in Ireland, and increasingly overseas. Chambers has appeared on some of Ireland's most popular television chat shows, and President Michael D. Higgins was a guest on a recent podcast episode. Acast says that more than half of the podcast's listeners are outside Ireland, and Chambers has toured live shows in Canada, Thailand, Spain and Belgium.
Before the podcast, Chambers's career took several surprising turns. He first used the alias "Blindboy" while making prank calls to radio call-in shows, which earned him some notoriety in Ireland and a cult following there. With a friend and fellow prank caller, Chambers formed a comedy hip-hop duo called the Rubberbandits that had a viral hit in 2010. That track, "Horse Outside," reached No. 2 in the Irish charts, and Chambers maneuvered that success into hosting comedy shows on MTV and the British station Channel 4.
The plastic bag on Chambers's head, which dates back to the beginning, was "part of a performance to challenge solemnity in whatever I do," he said. But it also guarantees anonymity: He is grateful to be spared some of the trappings of fame, particularly in a small country, he said.
"Being an Irish celebrity in itself is a bit cringe -- unless you're Paul Mescal, like, a proper celebrity," he said. "I don't want that level of cringe. Being Blindboy in real life would be a very, very cringe existence."
Anonymity also affords ‌Chambers ‌the freedom to talk candidly on the podcast about his personal struggles with mental health. He tells funny, relatable anecdotes about his experiences with, and efforts to manage, depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. One such episode is titled "Why I'm Going Back to Therapy."
This openness resonates with his mostly millennial and Gen Z audience. Leah Moloney, a 27-year-old Irish fan who started listening regularly during the pandemic, said in an interview that she found the mental health content "really helpful at that time, because he was speaking really openly, and I certainly felt less alone."
She added that when Chambers told listeners last April, in an episode called "Intrapersonally Speaking," that he had been diagnosed with autism, that had helped her adapt to an A.D.H.D. diagnosis she had recently received. "I've been inspired by him to be open," she said, adding that she now posts regularly about her experience of A.D.H.D. on TikTok.
Issues like these are still relatively under-discussed in the Irish news media and society, and Chambers's fans seem to welcome his candor. He gets "thousands and thousands" of social media messages about mental health, he said, but he could never deal with interactions like those in person. "If I didn't have the bag," Chambers said, "I'd stop talking about mental health‌."
On other episodes, Chambers talks frankly about an economic climate that he says has infantilized his generation. Ireland is in the grips of a rental crisis caused by a severe housing shortage; Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last month that the country of five million people had 250,000 too few homes. And it is Ireland's millennials who are worst affected, Chambers said. "The media will call a 40-year-old a young person. I'm in my late 30s and I refuse: I'm middle-aged," he added. "If you call it 'middle-aged people can't get housing,' it's obvious there is a problem."
Chambers said he saw a generational divide, too, in the way that the news media in the Republic of Ireland talks about Northern Irish politics. On the podcast, Chambers addresses millennial perspectives that he says news outlets in the South fail to reflect.
Sinn Fein, a political party that fields candidates on both sides of the border, has had a recent resurgence of popularity in the South, where it was once unpopular because it was associated with the Irish Republican Army. Chambers said the Irish news media continued to draw links between the party and terrorism. But for people born after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace in the North, he said, Sinn Fein lawmakers were "the ones who are doing something different." (He added that he did not endorse any political parties.)
Several popular Instagram accounts attest to this growing interest in Northern Irish politics among young people in the Republic. One of these, called Tanistry, posts plainly illustrated slides explaining historical events such as the Good Friday Agreement, or the Bloody Sunday massacre of 1972, and relating them to contemporary politics. Andrew Clarke, a 27-year-old college student from Belfast who runs the account, said that there had been a culture of "mystification" around Northern Irish politics and that he was "trying to make it digestible," adding that more than half of the account's followers were aged 24 to 35, with the highest concentrations in Dublin and Belfast.
The most interesting thing about the success of "The Blindboy Podcast," though, is the esoteric and seemingly random nature of many episodes. Where it is common for popular millennial podcasts to attract interest via culture war topics -- deliberately courting controversy, or talking mostly about trending social justice issues -- Chambers has garnered a huge audience mostly by talking about things that nobody is really supposed to care about.
One episode traces the history of offices back to monks; many others address arcane elements of Irish mythology. "Topographia Hibernica," a short story collection by Chambers that will be published in Ireland and Britain in November, explores these themes further, looking at the links between mythology and colonialism.
Talking to him can feel like skittering around a galaxy of Wikipedia wormholes (in a good way). There is an infectious quality to his enthusiasm for a seemingly endless, and frequently bizarre, catalog of interests and passions.
Chambers said he put the success of "The Blindboy Podcast" down to the fact he only ever talks about his genuine interests, something he thinks the audience can sense. "I'll never speak about something just to get listens," he said.

Star Treatment for an Old Standby: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the company's music director, is conducting a beloved production of Puccini's perennial classic for the first time.
Winter grips Paris at the start of the third act of Puccini's "La Bohème."
The shock of the cold is there in the loud, abrupt pair of notes as the curtain sweeps open -- a slap across a frozen face. A soft but terse march in the flute and harp is a pricking chill, which deepens in a muted chord that builds from the bottom to the top of the strings, then the woodwinds. The cellos shiver, almost inaudibly, below. In just a few seconds, Puccini has conjured February, frigid and lonely.
The Metropolitan Opera has put on "La Bohème" nearly 1,400 times, more than any other work; its players could do this moment in their sleep. But rarely are those chords at the beginning of Act III as poised and precisely tuned as they were when the company revived Franco Zeffirelli's beloved production on Friday evening, their resonance as they built so evocative of the echoing bells Puccini calls for soon after.
That tiny refinement is the kind of effect that needs real rehearsal to achieve, but "Bohème" doesn't usually get that. For an expensive repertory factory like the Met to function, not every piece can be given equal attention; some, particularly the core Italian standards, must be thrown onstage with very little attention at all. The result is that this Puccini chestnut tends to get done on a high level but not the highest, with experienced but not starry maestros.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Not so on Friday, when "La Bohème" was led for the first time at the Met by its current music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin -- with the resources, energy and focus that always attend productions overseen by a company's artistic leader.
This hasn't happened in decades. James Levine conducted "Bohème" more than 40 times at the Met, including the premiere of the Zeffirelli production in 1981. But not since Levine led a benefit performance in 1992 -- about 400 "Bohèmes" ago -- has a music director of the company been on the podium for it.
So there was an overall sense of polish and verve on Friday, particularly in the orchestra: the tanginess of the winds when the bohemians' landlord is regaling them in Act I, the delicacy of the strings at the beginning of Mimì's aria introducing herself to Rodolfo. Like Nézet-Séguin's approach to Verdi's "La Traviata," his "Bohème" is characterized by close juxtapositions of the sumptuous slowing down of tempos and furious bounding ahead. The goal of these back-and-forth extremes of speed seems to be feverish intensity, but the result is more often an atmospheric, even lightheaded dreaminess, beautiful and detailed but a bit unnatural.
As Rodolfo and Marcello's wistful duet began in the final act, for example, Nézet-Séguin pulled the reins until the music almost solidified into nostalgic amber: Time literally stopped. It is, he wrote on Instagram, "fulfilling my dream" to conduct this score at the Met, and there was throughout a sense of his lingering over it, however lovingly.
The chorus, like the orchestra, was adroit, even in the Latin Quarter chaos of Act II. Best in the cast was the bass-baritone Christian Van Horn, his Colline solidly, capaciously and wittily sung. As Marcello, Davide Luciano seemed to be showing off the size of his substantial baritone by sometimes bellowing. Alexey Lavrov's baritone, on the other hand, often vanished as Schaunard, and Sylvia D'Eramo had an expressive face but a wispy soprano as Musetta.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There's often a certain blandness to Stephen Costello's calm, restrained tenor. But as his voice warmed through his performance as Rodolfo on Friday, what started off as coolness came to feel more like poignant reserve. The soprano Eleonora Buratto was a forthright rather than fragile Mimì, with muscular high notes tending toward the steel more often associated with Cio-Cio-San in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly."
All in all, it was clear who the central figure of this "Bohème" was: the man waving the baton. These days, splashy contemporary operas and new productions get the spotlight -- and get the music director. But for the sake of the company's artistic health and vibrancy, it's important to also have Nézet-Séguin in the pit for titles that too often get taken for granted.

An Outsider Takes on Ireland, From Inside a Plastic Bag

Irish podcaster David Chambers spends his days in an exceptionally drab office. A room so drab it is striking. In a recent interview via Zoom, he was dressed to match, in a white T-shirt and plain black hoodie. The only noteworthy thing on screen was an orange and white plastic bag that Chambers wore over his head. His green eyes, thick eyebrows and beard could be seen through the bag’s holes, but the rest of his face was obscured.
Although they don’t know what he looks like underneath the mask, most people in Ireland know Chambers, 37, by his pseudonym “Blindboy Boatclub,” or, more often, just “Blindboy.” He is best known as the host of “The Blindboy Podcast,” a weekly show in which he discusses eclectic topics, like the unlikely benefits of lion urine or the link between heavy metal and futurism, and tells personal anecdotes that unspool like short stories. He addresses topics like mental health that Irish news media outlets rarely touch, and brings a millennial sensibility to political discussions. His register is earnest and intellectual, but also funny and down-to-earth.
“The Blindboy Podcast,” which Chambers started in 2017, regularly attracts 700,000 to 1 million monthly listeners, according to Acast, the company that hosts it. Six years on, it is something of a cultural phenomenon in Ireland, and increasingly overseas. Chambers has appeared on some of Ireland’s most popular television chat shows, and President Michael D. Higgins was a guest on a recent podcast episode. Acast says that more than half of the podcast’s listeners are outside Ireland, and Chambers has toured live shows in Canada, Thailand, Spain and Belgium.
Before the podcast, Chambers’ career took several surprising turns. He first used the alias “Blindboy” while making prank calls to radio call-in shows, which earned him some notoriety in Ireland and a cult following there. With a friend and fellow prank caller, Chambers formed a comedy hip-hop duo called the Rubberbandits that had a viral hit in 2010. That track, “Horse Outside,” reached No. 2 in the Irish charts, and Chambers maneuvered that success into hosting comedy shows on MTV and the British station Channel 4.
The plastic bag on Chambers’ head, which dates back to the beginning, was “part of a performance to challenge solemnity in whatever I do,” he said. But it also guarantees anonymity: He is grateful to be spared some of the trappings of fame, particularly in a small country, he said.
“Being an Irish celebrity in itself is a bit cringe — unless you’re Paul Mescal, like, a proper celebrity,” he said. “I don’t want that level of cringe. Being Blindboy in real life would be a very, very cringe existence.”
Anonymity also affords Chambers the freedom to talk candidly on the podcast about his personal struggles with mental health. He tells funny, relatable anecdotes about his experiences with, and efforts to manage, depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. One such episode is titled “Why I’m Going Back to Therapy.”
This openness resonates with his mostly millennial and Generation Z audience. Leah Moloney, a 27-year-old Irish fan who started listening regularly during the pandemic, said in an interview that she found the mental health content “really helpful at that time, because he was speaking really openly, and I certainly felt less alone.”
She added that when Chambers told listeners last April, in an episode called “Intrapersonally Speaking,” that he had been diagnosed with autism, that had helped her adapt to an attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis she had recently received. “I’ve been inspired by him to be open,” she said, adding that she now posts regularly about her experience of ADHD on TikTok.
Issues like these are still relatively under-discussed in the Irish news media and society, and Chambers’ fans seem to welcome his candor. He gets “thousands and thousands” of social media messages about mental health, he said, but he could never deal with interactions like those in person. “If I didn’t have the bag,” Chambers said, “I’d stop talking about mental health.”
On other episodes, Chambers talks frankly about an economic climate that he says has infantilized his generation. Ireland is in the grips of a rental crisis caused by a severe housing shortage; Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last month that the country of 5 million people had 250,000 too few homes. And it is Ireland’s millennials who are worst affected, Chambers said. “The media will call a 40-year-old a young person. I’m in my late 30s and I refuse: I’m middle-aged,” he added. “If you call it ‘middle-aged people can’t get housing,’ it’s obvious there is a problem.”
Chambers said he saw a generational divide, too, in the way that the news media in the Republic of Ireland talks about Northern Irish politics. On the podcast, Chambers addresses millennial perspectives that he says news outlets in the South fail to reflect.
Sinn Fein, a political party that fields candidates on both sides of the border, has had a recent resurgence of popularity in the South, where it was once unpopular because it was associated with the Irish Republican Army. Chambers said the Irish news media continued to draw links between the party and terrorism. But for people born after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace in the North, he said, Sinn Fein lawmakers were “the ones who are doing something different.” (He added that he did not endorse any political parties.)
Several popular Instagram accounts attest to this growing interest in Northern Irish politics among young people in the Republic. One of these, called Tanistry, posts plainly illustrated slides explaining historical events such as the Good Friday Agreement, or the Bloody Sunday massacre of 1972, and relating them to contemporary politics. Andrew Clarke, a 27-year-old college student from Belfast, Northern Ireland, who runs the account, said that there had been a culture of “mystification” around Northern Irish politics and that he was “trying to make it digestible,” adding that more than half of the account’s followers were aged 24 to 35, with the highest concentrations in Dublin and Belfast.

The Loss of Innocence Is in the Air: [Style Desk]

Full text: A whiff of strawberry sweetness hits you as soon as you walk into "The Pink Bedroom," an exhibit at the Museum of Sex in New York. The installation is a jumble of shocking pink objects (stuffed animals, makeup compacts, music boxes, shoes and sex toys) arranged around a bed made with pink sheets and pillows. But it also features a mishmash of smells: rose, baby powder and ... is that cat pee?
The artist Portia Munson has exhibited different versions of "The Pink Bedroom," a diorama that explores girlhood and femininity, since 1994. Her show at the Museum of Sex, which runs through July, is the first time the installation has had a signature scent.
It was created by Marissa Zappas, 36, a perfumer in Brooklyn. Ms. Zappas, who has a namesake line, has developed a reputation for creating fragrances with atypical collaborators like sex workers, poets and astrologers, most of whom are women.
"The Pink Bedroom" perfume -- small bottles of which cost $ 45 -- has, in a way, been years in the making: Ms. Zappas first approached Ms. Munson, 62, about working on a project together in 2018. Ms. Zappas loosely modeled the scent after the smell of Cupcake Dolls, a type of fragrant toy popular in the 1990s.
A theme of "The Pink Bedroom" exhibition is the loss of innocence, and Ms. Zappas wanted the perfume to reflect that. To balance the sweetness evoked by its floral and fruity notes, Ms. Zappas added cassis bud, which has an acrid smell that she said is often mistaken for that of cat pee.
"There are these classic pink 'girlie' smells, but then there is also something that feels unsettling, uncomfortable," Ms. Zappas said recently while standing inside "The Pink Bedroom" installation, into which her perfume is pumped through a diffuser.
Ms. Munson said that Ms. Zappas understood "'The Pink Bedroom' is meant to be very seductive and beautiful, but also a little bit too much and a little yucky."
Jane Dashley, who reviews perfumes for Fragraphilia, a fragrance website that she helped found, said that Ms. Zappas specializes in scents that are "uniquely feminine, like a fairy tale, ballerina, bows-and-ribbons kind of feminine." But, Ms. Dashley said, there is a darkness under the surface.
Latex and Leather
In 2019 Ms. Zappas created a fragrance inspired by "Porn Carnival: Paradise Edition," a book of love poems by Rachel Rabbit White. After reading the book, Ms. Zappas contacted Ms. White and the two developed Paradise Edition, a scent with notes of jasmine, orange blossom and salt water.
In 2021, Ms. Zappas released "Wh*re," a perfume inspired by "Whore of New York," a memoir by Liara Roux about her sex work. Ms. Roux said that the fragrance, which smells of cherry, rose and leather, evoked "the nasty, visceral fleshiness and the surreal glamour" of her book.
"I asked her to make a scent that captured the feeling of just having worked -- something that smelled like money, condoms and sex," said Ms. Roux.
Ms. Zappas said that although perfume has a history of being used as a tool of seduction, "sexy" can mean different things -- or smells -- to different people. She is less interested in defining what sex smells like than she is in exploring the ways and reasons people wear perfume. "Sex is a major one," she added.
A fragrance called Annabel's Birthday Cake, with notes of whipped cream and latex, is her most popular, Ms. Zappas said. She created it with her friend Annabel Gat, an astrologer who was born one day after Ms. Zappas.
Ms. Zappas runs her business from her apartment in Brooklyn, where part of her living room has become a perfume lab. Small bottles and vials of aroma chemicals cover the desk where she works, and just a few feet away is a stripper pole, which Ms. Zappas installed after a breakup. "Dancing really helps take me back into my body and not think so much," she said.
While discussing what led her to become a perfumer, Ms. Zappas plunked a framed photo of the actress Elizabeth Taylor down onto a coffee table. The picture was from a collection that she said at one point totaled some 1,200 photos of the actress, whose eyes were the inspiration for a pair of tattoos Ms. Zappas has on her inner arms.
Ms. Zappas became fascinated with Taylor as a child, after seeing "National Velvet." When she later learned of Taylor's foray into the fragrance business, Ms. Zappas said it intensified her interest in perfume.
Ms. Zappas, who was born in Southern California and raised in the Bay Area, said she has been obsessed with scents since childhood, when she would spend time at a fig orchard planted by her father.
She moved to New York City in 2011, to study at the New School. In early 2015, she started a temp job as a receptionist at the New York office of Givaudan, a fragrance company that has developed perfumes for Coach, Estée Lauder and Tom Ford, among others.
During that job, Ms. Zappas applied for an apprenticeship with one of Givaudan's master perfumers, Olivier Gillotin. At the time she applied for the apprenticeship, Ms. Zappas was studying cemetery construction. "I was learning about the history of deodorization," she said.
Mr. Gillotin said her studies were much different from anyone else's he had met working in the industry. She began her apprenticeship with him around the time of her graduation in 2015. When it ended, he advised her to strike out on her own, telling her then that she could make more of a mark on the industry from the outside than the inside.
Feeling Alive
Most of Ms. Zappas's perfumes are produced in limited quantities and start at about $ 150 a bottle. She also takes commissions for custom fragrances, a service that starts at about $ 4,000 a bottle (refills cost about $ 200).
To develop a custom perfume, Ms. Zappas probes clients' memories for scent associations. "This is my favorite part, learning about their specific memories from childhood, like what foods their mother made, or what their backyard smells like," she said.
Sera Gamble, a creator of the Netflix series "You," commissioned a perfume last July after discovering Ms. Zappas's products on Instagram. "I was so taken with the idea that she collaborates with poets and astrologers," Ms. Gamble, 39, said.
The fragrance is still in development. "Perfume is ideally slow," Ms. Zappas said.
She is also working on "Maggie the Cat is Alive, I'm Alive!," a perfume with notes of violets, peaches and champagne. The name is from dialogue by Elizabeth Taylor in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."
"I'm finally feeling more settled, with enough confidence to make a fragrance worthy of her," Ms. Zappas said.
She added, "Quite honestly, I just feel alive."

A New Wedding Line With 'Cheekiness': [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The dress -- a sort of elevated nightgown -- drew devoted fans during the pandemic. Now it comes in bridal styles.
The Trevi Fountain in Rome. Oktoberfest in Munich. Highclere Castle in Britain, which some may know better by its other (fictional) name: Downton Abbey.
These are three of the more far-flung places where people have documented themselves on Instagram wearing the Nap Dress, a garment introduced by the brand Hill House Home in 2019. The dress, as its name suggests, was conceived as a sort of elevated nightgown -- comfortable enough to sleep in, stylish enough to step outside in. During the pandemic, it drew devoted fans, with many sharing photos of themselves on social media using the hashtag #napdressnation.
The dress has a smocked bodice and a full skirt that typically hits above the ankles. It has been produced in several styles, colors and patterns, and has been adopted by various types: influencers, of course, but also mothers (some of whom put their children in coordinating dresses) and even brides.
"In the early days, we would see people organically wearing our products to get married in," said Nell Diamond, 34, the founder and chief executive of Hill House Home. She added that many customers asked for more traditional wedding clothing.
This month, Hill House Home is expanding into bridal with its first wedding line. It features more than a dozen pieces, including three new Nap Dresses in white fabrics.
The new styles include a shorter Nap Dress in lace ( $ 250), a full-length lace dress with black ribbons as shoulder straps ( $ 395) and a full-length tulle dress with blue ribbons as straps (also $ 395).
"We loved the idea of adding nontraditional colors into a wedding collection," Ms. Diamond said of the full-length dresses' straps. "There's a little sense of cheekiness."
Ms. Diamond started Hill House Home in 2016, after working at Deutsche Bank in New York. Her company's retail footprint now includes three stores: one in Midtown, another in Palm Beach, Fla., and a seasonal shop on Nantucket, where she spent summers growing up.
At first, Hill House Home sold only bedding. But Ms. Diamond said it wasn't long before she started to explore expanding into apparel. She added that back then, she knew that if she were to make clothing, one of her first pieces would be a dress.
"I really am not a pants person," she said. "I need to be free."
At her 2014 wedding on the French Riviera, which was covered by Vogue, Ms. Diamond wore a gown by Olivier Theyskens. It had a 10-foot train and required three fittings to produce.
Over the course of the festivities she wore several other garments (by Rosie Assoulin, Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana), and she said that a bridal Nap Dress would have fit right in with the rest of her wardrobe.
"I would have loved that fun, beautiful dress to get ready in," Ms. Diamond said, instead of "a random sweatshirt."

U.K. Man's Death Tied To Reaction to Vaccine: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One expert said the blood-clotting syndrome was estimated to occur in one in 50,000 people under 40 and one in 100,000 over 40 who received AstraZeneca's vaccine.
A 32-year-old psychologist in Britain developed blood clots and died 10 days after he took his first dose of AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine, a report released by a London coroner on Wednesday found, in a highly rare case of a fatal reaction to the vaccine.
The inquest, which was requested by Charlotte Wright, the widow of Dr. Stephen Wright, found that he died on Jan. 26, 2021, as a result of "unintended consequences of vaccination." Ms. Wright is suing AstraZeneca.
According to the report, Dr. Wright, of Kent, England, had a stroke and bleeding in the brain, as well as vaccine-induced thrombosis, or blood clots, and thrombocytopenia, a condition that occurs when the platelet level in the blood is abnormally low.
Since 2021, researchers have cited rare cases in which people have developed the blood-clotting syndrome known as TTS after receiving the Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca Covid vaccines, which are similar. The cases typically occur within weeks of vaccination.
Experts still strongly recommend vaccination, saying that although vaccines are associated with certain rare side effects, those risks are dwarfed by the risks of the coronavirus itself.
"It's really quite rare and, at the end of the day, you need to consider the risks versus the benefits with anything you do," said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "And when you look at the vaccines, they're very safe and very effective."
He added: "Nothing is risk-free. And if you choose not to get the vaccine, then you're at greater risk for getting the disease and serious consequences."
Researchers have estimated that coronavirus vaccines have saved millions of lives, including an estimated 507,000 in the United Kingdom in the first year they were administered.
Dr. Beverley Hunt, a thrombosis expert in London, said that the blood-clotting syndrome was a "very rare event" following the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, estimated to occur in one in 50,000 people under 40 and one in 100,000 over 40.
Dr. Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol, said that very approximate figures suggest that about 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been given in the United Kingdom, with about 200 cases and 40 deaths linked to the blood-clotting syndrome.
Britain curbed the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine for people under 30 in April 2021, citing the risk of rare blood clots.
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration limited the use of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine in May 2022 to adults who cannot or who refuse to get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, also citing the risk of rare blood clots.
AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine has not been approved for use in the United States, and last year the company withdrew its application for F.D.A. approval.
In Australia, the country's Department of Health and Aged Care described TTS as a rare syndrome that had occurred in around two to three people per 100,000 who had been given the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Symptoms -- including severe, persistent headache and blurred vision -- typically occur between four and 42 days after a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the department said.
Australia stopped the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine last month, saying newer vaccines better targeted current strains of the virus.
In an analysis released last month of immunization and death records in Britain, researchers found that young women who received at least one dose of AstraZeneca's vaccine might have been more likely to die of a heart problem in the 12 weeks after their vaccination.
The researchers did not find a significantly elevated risk of death in any other subgroup or with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was also widely used in Britain. And the study did not prove that the vaccines caused the deaths.
Andrew Harris, a senior coroner who presented the results of Dr. Wright's inquest at London Inner South Coroner's Court on Wednesday, described Dr. Wright's death as a "very unusual and deeply tragic case," the BBC reported.
The inquest found that Dr. Wright was a "fit and healthy man" who received his first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Jan. 16, 2021. He awoke with a headache on Jan. 25, 2021, and later developed left arm numbness, the inquest found.
He went to a hospital emergency room just after midnight and was found to have high blood pressure and sagittal sinus venous thrombosis. He was transferred to another hospital at about 6:30 a.m. but was unfit for surgery because of bleeding and a very low platelet level. He died at 6:33 p.m.
Ms. Wright said in a message on Instagram that she had asked for the inquest so that she could change her husband's death certificate, which said he had died of "natural causes," including a stroke. She said she wanted it to list the vaccine-induced blood syndrome as his cause of death.
"The inquest yesterday confirmed this change, over 2 years later," Ms. Wright said.
Ms. Wright also said the inquest "allows us to be able to continue our litigation against AstraZeneca. This is the written proof," the BBC reported.
Mr. Harris told the court that it was "very important to record as fact that it is the AstraZeneca vaccine -- but that is different from blaming AstraZeneca," the BBC reported.
Ms. Wright, who has described herself as a "vaccine widow," indicated that she was not opposed to vaccines in general. "I think they should be given with appropriate informed consent," she said.
AstraZeneca, which has named its vaccine Vaxzevria, said in a statement: "We are very saddened by Stephen Wright's death and extend our deepest sympathies to his family for their loss." The statement said that patient safety was the company's highest priority.
"From the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-world data, Vaxzevria has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects," the statement said.

Lots of Family Time for a Restaurateur: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maneesh Goyal, a bar and restaurant owner, is now intrigued by the city's parks and playgrounds and has an earlier bedtime.
"Your eyes work differently when you become a parent, and you start seeing things in your city that you never saw," Maneesh Goyal, the Manhattan businessman and restaurateur, said of fatherhood. Last year, he and his husband adopted a baby boy, now 20 months old.
Mr. Goyal is one of the owners of Temple Bar in NoLIta, as well as Sona, an Indian restaurant in the Flatiron district, and Sona Home, an online home goods store. For many years he said he had a lot of identities, most of which seemed to circumvent parenthood and his Indian American roots.
Growing up in Dallas, he was a Texan first. But in 1999, he moved to New York and became "an events guy, a marketing guy, an entrepreneur and a gay New Yorker," he said. "Now I'm all about teaching what I took for granted from my cultural heritage."
Mr. Goyal, 48, still loves to curate lively dinner parties, so he and his husband, Andrew Wingrove, 41 the chief commercial officer of Tanger Outlets, are thankful that their son, Adrian, is a good sleeper. They live together in a loft apartment in the Flatiron district of Manhattan.
SOUND OF SINGING The time I wake up is no longer up to me. So we wake anywhere between 6:30 and 8 a.m. Lately, Adrian gets up and sings and then knocks on his door. It's actually so joyful to wake up to the sound of singing. Long ago my pattern was to wake up to a hangover, so it's a nice evolution.
STORY TIME After Adrian's diaper is changed, he asks for books, so we read. A lot of our friends have given us books about adopted kids, children from biracial families, and same-sex parents, so hopefully he'll start to see himself in these stories.
GETTING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER Breakfast is usually pancakes and scrambled eggs, and I'm seeing that I always finish his plate so I am careful not to have too much on mine. Then we have playtime at home, which might turn into family band hour. He's on the guitar. Either Andrew or I am on the synthesizer. His favorite song is "La Bamba."
HIDDEN PLAYGROUNDS Then we head out of the house. Sometimes it's just a walk around the neighborhood. Other times we walk to Union Square or Washington Square Park. Funny that I never noticed the two playgrounds in these parks before Adrian. They're fabulous.
BRUNCH IN THE BUILDING Before Adrian takes a nap around 12:30 p.m., we go over to our neighbor's house for brunch. Of the seven apartments in my building, five have turned over many, many times, so I've gotten close to my neighbors David and Blanche, as we've become the mainstays of our building. They have made me feel less alone and more safe.
WORK-LIFE GAMBLE While Adrian is taking a nap for about two hours, I either try to spend some time with Andrew or I work. I live close to my restaurant, Sona, so I pop in to check in with my team. Then I often swing by our new home, which we'll move into in about a year. It happens to be on the same block as the restaurant, so it'll either be great or hazardous to my work-life balance.
PLAY DATES Then I might pick up some groceries. We also like to meet up with friends with kids. One group is made up of all my Indian friends with kids. It's funny, as he's the one white kid in a midst of Indian American girls. Or we might have a play date with a child from a same-sex parents group.
SIMPLE DINNER Once we're home, we have an easy, no-frills rest of the day. Andrew will cook dinner for Adrian. We've used our air fryer and Instant Pot a lot since the pandemic. We'll make mini pizzas and we have fallen prey to chicken nuggets. But we can also feed him pasta with clam sauce. Then it's an extra-long bath time.
THANKS, SUN Previously Adrian used to go to bed, without fail, at around 7 p.m. But I think daylight saving time has screwed this up, and it takes a lot longer for him to wind down and get to bed. Now it's more like 8 p.m.
TAKEOUT AND TV Most often, once Adrian is down, we'll order dinner for ourselves. We have a penchant for Asian and Mexican cuisine. Then it's time to unwind with some TV shows. Andrew is obsessed with true crime shows or any whodunits. I love to watch any show about families. I try to be in bed by 11 p.m.

Supreme Rolls to the Sunset Strip: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The once-scrappy brand moves its Los Angeles store to the famed Tower Records building, but is bigger actually better?
Supreme's first brick-and-mortar store opened on Lafayette Street in SoHo, in 1994, well before the luxury shops and trendy restaurants moved in. So when James Jebbia, the brand's founder, decided on a Los Angeles location, he listened to that same instinct to settle in an unexpected part of town.
Today, the same stretch of Fairfax Avenue that Supreme chose in 2004 is the city's unofficial streetwear corridor. Its sidewalks are crowded with young men and women in baggy pants, hoodies and overpriced sneakers. Now, there's Tyler, the Creator's Golf Wang store, the Hundreds and the sneaker resale shop Flight Club.
But Supreme has left the building.
In February, the brand opened its 8,500-square-foot flagship on the Sunset Strip. It occupies the former Tower Records space, a store that, for decades, defined that particular curve of the street, and the music-centric milieu that grew around it.
The low-slung white building features the Supreme red box logo perched on top. Inside, the walls are dominated by hand-painted murals -- a reaper from Josh Smith; Nate Lowman's signature bullet holes -- but it's the 36-foot-wide, 40-foot-deep skate bowl suspended from an elevated deck that is the focus, a much larger version of what used to be in the Fairfax shop. In relocating, Supreme may no longer feel like David defeating Goliath so much as becoming Goliath.
The brand is no longer the cheeky upstart that appealed only to a small group of surly skateboarders, but a global enterprise with huge name recognition.
It's hard to pinpoint when, exactly, the tide turned. It could have been around 2011 when members of the musical group Odd Future wore Supreme to a string of high-profile appearances. Or it may have been in 2017, when Supreme collaborated with Louis Vuitton -- a full circle moment from when, in 2000, Louis Vuitton issued a cease-and-desist order to Supreme for using its monogram motif on a series of skateboard decks.
Or maybe it was the 2020 acquisition of Supreme by VF Corporation, a conglomerate that owns brands such as Vans and North Face. The deal valued Supreme at $ 2.1 billion -- a staggering sum for a company that traffics mainly in T-shirts and snapback hats.
But to many, Supreme's worth doesn't start and stop at just the products.
'It's hard to see your favorite brand explode'
Supreme is looking back on 30 years, and can be seen as an example of how to maintain an edge in the face of an industry that is increasingly owned by a few large corporations.
The brand was partly built on being the arbiter of a new playbook that has been widely copied by upstart labels and heritage brands alike. It essentially pioneered the so-called drop system: releasing a limited supply of products at a specific time and place, often causing lines to form in front of their stores that doubled as free advertising; the drops frequently sold out.
It also collaborated with artists, musicians and other fashion brands ranging from the high-end (Burberry, Louis Vuitton) to workaday (Dickies, Hanes).
"I still love the Fairfax store, but we were constrained by the space and outgrew it," Mr. Jebbia wrote in an email. "I had been looking at the Tower Records spot for a long time, and similar to when we first went to Fairfax, we didn't want to be in an obvious area, like on Melrose, or La Brea or Beverly Hills."
Javier Nunez, 40, who worked at the Fairfax location, said that some people in the neighborhood told them they wouldn't make it. He fondly recalled that the neighborhood was so quiet then that he would set up a garbage can in a nearby corner crosswalk to perform skate tricks.
Skate shops often serve as a headquarters of sorts, or a place to simply waste time. The Sunset Boulevard move echoes the one made by Supreme in New York in 2019 when it relocated to a flashier space on the corner of Bowery and Spring. To some, these moves represent a transfer from clubhouses to temples of capitalism.
"They still have skating very much at their core," said Eugene Lardy, who runs the streetwear newsletter Street Night Live, "but obviously the brand has changed and evolved over the last decade."
Mr. Lardy, 29, was first introduced to Supreme in 2008, and saw the brand as a conduit between the insular world of skateboarding and the broader culture. "I went through the phase where I thought they were selling out, like it's becoming something bigger than something for hard-core skaters. It's hard to see your favorite brand explode too much, and then get outside investment."
"I get why people get upset," Mr. Lardy said. "But I also understand the natural growth in a business cycle. You always want to continue to grow."
Supreme is now old enough that it means different things to different people. "The clothing feels very separate from the skateboarding," said Jack Bravstein, a skateboarder and writer in New York. For Mr. Bravstein, 22, a seminal moment was seeing the 2018 Supreme-produced film "Blessed," by the director William Strobeck, which highlights the label's in-house skateboarding program. "They're still pushing this aspect of edginess and creativity in their videos, which I think is the most important part of the brand right now," Mr. Bravstein said.
"But you can walk into the Supreme store and never have touched a skateboard, or not know it was a skate shop," he added. "So in that regard they killed it, as a brand. They know what they're doing."
All the talk that the brand is over is proof of its continued relevance, said Michael McIntosh, the founder of Supreme Leaks News, a website and Instagram page that covers streetwear brands. That discussion, he pointed out, has been going on for at least a decade.
But as Supreme's profile grows ever larger, there will be a certain cohort who remembers its humbler, rebellious days. For them, the shop on Fairfax didn't just change the very character of a street, it also held a central place in their lives.
Sage Elsesser, an artist and professional skateboarder once sponsored by Supreme, grew up in Los Angeles and recalled that at the back of the store there was a door frame to the stockroom where employees and friends of the brand would mark their heights as they got older. When Mr. Jebbia was in town with his children, they too would record their measurements.
"I hadn't thought about that for a long time," Mr. Elsesser said. "I wonder if it's still there." Clockwise from right: inside Supreme's new space; a line outside on a recent Saturday; and at the brand's party at Chateau Marmont.

Margaret Cho comedian and actress and Atsuko Okatsuka comedian: [TStyle]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Both comedians imagined the other was born confident -- but it took years for each to find her voice.
Margaret Cho: If I go back and look at my comedy sets from the '90s, my voice was all over the place. It was this confusion of, "Who am I supposed to be?" I had a hard time understanding, or committing to, artistic integrity, whereas Atsuko already has the presentation down: She knows who she is. She has a strong sense of self that took me a long time to develop.
To me, humor is the unexpected thought that comes through. Atsuko's work is observational, but it's delivered through misdirection. She's big in the comedy community, in terms of both the way she works and the extent to which she works -- the incredible variety of things she's been able to do, whether it's on TikTok or Instagram, or having the cast of "Saturday Night Live" accept one of her [social media] challenges.
It's rare, in comedy, certainly, but in entertainment in general, to find somebody with a unique point of view that blends so seamlessly into what they do as an artist. It's how she looks at everything -- family dynamics, for example, by including her grandmother -- or the way she communicates her sensibility as an Asian American: She's got Taiwanese in there, Japanese and Californian. And that hair. Nobody in the history of comedy has had better hair.
On the Cover
Atsuko Okatsuka: Margaret was the first comedian I'd ever seen do stand-up. I was an immigrant living in a garage with my mom and grandma. Our world was small, and I had a hard time making friends, so if my immediate family members weren't into something, I probably hadn't seen it. I was at church, during a sermon, when someone passed me a DVD of Margaret's [2002 comedy special] "Margaret Cho: Notorious C.H.O." like it was contraband.
What I think we all saw in Margaret was confidence. I often wonder what it must feel like for her, knowing who she is since she was born. It took me probably 10 years to figure out my voice. I've told her, and maybe she should be reminded more often, that not only was she a trailblazer but she keeps evolving -- the way she talks about things has changed with the times, too. When I say "trailblazer," I mean that she made her mark and continues to do so. That last part I haven't told her.
Interviews have been edited and condensed.

Full text: Davis, who goes by Tank, said he wants to be a star, "the whole package." For now he is known for decisive victories in the ring and dubious decisions outside of it.
The scene was a cross between a hip-hop concert and the Met Gala as Gervonta Davis sauntered toward the boxing ring for his 2019 fight against Yuriorkis Gamboa.
Many of the 14,000 people at State Farm Arena in Atlanta were decked out in expensive fur coats and jewelry. Fans stood with their phones raised to record as Davis emerged from a tunnel, trailed by television cameras and surrounded by an entourage that included the rapper Lil Baby performing his song "Woah."
Celebrities in attendance included the rapper Lil' Kim and the former N.B.A. stars Julius Erving and Shaquille O'Neal, all there to see Davis, known as Tank, fight for the World Boxing Association world lightweight championship.
"Anytime that you can bring out everybody from the Migos to Dr. J to the same event, you've covered all the bases," said Stephen Espinoza, the president of Showtime Sports. "You've covered different eras, different demographics, you've gotten royalty from both the sports and music genres, and that's another thing that separates Tank."
The moment was an indication that Davis, 28, had arrived as one of boxing's biggest stars, and he rewarded the crowd's enthusiasm by knocking out Gamboa in the 12th round. Since then, Davis (28-0) has captivated fans and grown the biggest celebrity fan base in the sport by delivering crunching knockouts that go viral on social media. But he has done it with little of the charisma and flamboyance that have characterized most famous boxers, and has made serious personal missteps.
Davis will be back in the ring in Las Vegas on Saturday against Ryan Garcia (23-0), another quick-punching boxer whose popularity nearly rivals Davis's. The fight will be contested at a 136-pound catchweight. But even with another victory, Davis will face questions about how he conducts himself outside the boxing ring.
On May 5, he will be sentenced for running a red light in his Lamborghini in November 2020 and crashing into another vehicle, injuring its four occupants, and then leaving the scene. He pleaded guilty to four charges after a judge, citing the victims' injuries, rejected a plea offer from prosecutors that would have allowed Davis to avoid jail time.
And on May 26, Davis will be arraigned on battery charges related to a January incident at his home in Parkland, Fla.
According to a report from the Broward County sheriff's office, Davis struck a woman on the right side of her head with a "closed hand type slap." The woman, who is the mother of Davis's daughter, later posted on Instagram that there had been a heated argument but that no one was hurt. She filed an affidavit on Jan. 24 to have the charges dismissed.
The incident occurred 11 days before Davis's most recent bout, against Héctor Luis García.
"I need to just make better decisions in the future," Davis said in a recent interview. He added: "I want to build my team stronger and build that wall in front of me so pretty much nothing can get in between me and my goals and my future."
Boxing has long been dominated by oversize personalities like Floyd Mayweather, Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson and Oscar De La Hoya, who understood that selling a fight with trash talk and drama was almost as essential as winning it.
Davis is not quite there yet.
"Those were all guys without exception with huge personalities that lit up a room," Espinoza said, "that can sit down, and they could hold court for hours with reporters."
He continued, "And that's not to say that Tank doesn't light up a room, but one of the intriguing things and paradoxical things about Tank is, you know, he's a little bit shy. And like so many things in Tank's background, it doesn't seem like the perfect blueprint for stardom."
Davis has often given the impression that he would rather be anywhere other than at news conferences and in interviews; he often gives short responses or does not answer questions at all.
That attitude has seemed to shift in the run-up to Saturday's fight, as Davis has initiated most of the verbal sparring at news conferences. He said he has become more comfortable in those situations.
"I've got to be more open," Davis said. "That's what really hurts me. I think I need to open up more and show people the other side of me."
At 5-foot-5 and 135 pounds, Davis throws powerful punches, knocking out 26 of his 28 opponents. In a sport where popular fighters are sometimes criticized for bouts lacking excitement, Davis almost always delivers it.
After he beat García in a technical knockout, García said Davis hit him so hard that he could not see and did not know where he was. The win drew admiring tweets from the N.B.A.'s Ja Morant and Bradley Beal, and the N.F.L.'s Deebo Samuel, among others.
"He has a celebrity fan base unlike any other fighter I've seen in the sport," Espinoza said, "other than potentially Floyd Mayweather."
Still, Davis, who is the No. 3 ranked fighter at 135 pounds, arguably the most competitive division in boxing, has been criticized for handpicking easy opponents to bolster his record. "I feel as though I get the most hate," Davis said, adding: "It don't matter who I fight. If it's not the person they want me to fight, they bash me, and they just look one-sided. They just keep blaming me for everything."
But even Davis's trainer, Calvin Ford, said he was waiting for a fighter to "bring the best out of" Davis. "Coaches that have been around us for years know that people haven't seen all that he can do," Ford said.
Mayweather, who was also criticized during his undefeated career for avoiding tough fights, had been a mentor to Davis.
Davis signed with Mayweather's promotional company when he was 18, and Mayweather routinely positioned Davis as the heir to his throne, increasing the attention Davis got. But Davis and Mayweather's relationship has become strained in the last year. Davis once wrote in a now-deleted tweet that "the love was gone" between him and Mayweather.
Davis's fight against Rolly Romero in May 2022 was his last with Mayweather Promotions, but he said he's "always got respect" for Mayweather. "He's someone that helped me help out and got me where I'm at today," Davis said.
After having a front-row seat to the end of Mayweather's career, Davis said he learned how valuable it is to be the "whole package" as a boxer and how one's decisions outside of the ring can translate to higher -- or lower -- earnings.
So Davis said he welcomed his fast-growing celebrity, even though it might not always look that way.
"I don't want to just be a great fighter," Davis said, "I want to be a star. And I think I'm becoming that star that I always wanted to be."

Full text: Mr. Baldwin had been charged with involuntary manslaughter after the gun he was practicing with went off on a film set, killing the cinematographer. The film's armorer still faces charges.
New Mexico prosecutors are dropping the involuntary manslaughter charges that were filed against Alec Baldwin for the 2021 shooting death of a cinematographer on the set of the film "Rust," the government's latest setback as it pursued a high-profile case that has been closely watched by the movie industry and the country.
It was a dramatic reversal in the case against Mr. Baldwin, just months after the prosecutors who originally handled the case had filed charges against him, including one that carried five years in prison. Since then they downgraded that charge, which stemmed from a law that was not in effect at the time of the shooting; the special prosecutor leading the case stepped down after her appointment was challenged on legal grounds; and the district attorney in charge of the case, Mary Carmack-Altwies, stepped back and appointed two new special prosecutors to lead it.
The decision to drop the charges against Mr. Baldwin came after the new prosecutors reviewed new evidence that showed that the gun he was practicing with had been modified before it was delivered to the set, according to an official close to the investigation who was granted anonymity to discuss the case. That undercut the prosecution's original argument that the gun could not have fired unless Mr. Baldwin had pulled the trigger, the official said.
It is possible that prosecutors could decide to file new charges against Mr. Baldwin.
"New facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis in the case against Alec Baldwin," Kari Morrissey, one of the new special prosecutors, said in a statement. "Therefore, we cannot proceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form. This decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled."
The shooting occurred on Oct. 21, 2021, when a gun Mr. Baldwin was practicing with on the set of "Rust" went off, killing the film's cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and wounding its director, Joel Souza.
Mr. Baldwin had been told that day that the gun he was practicing with -- a replica of a vintage revolver -- was "cold," meaning there was no live ammunition in it. He has maintained from the beginning that he did not pull the trigger before the gun fired, telling investigators that it went off after he had pulled the hammer back and let it go. But the original prosecutors had said that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun showed that he must have pulled the trigger, which contributed to their decision to bring charges.
In a statement, Mr. Baldwin's lawyers, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, said, "We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident."
Paperwork officially dismissing those charges is expected to be filed before a status hearing on the case on Friday afternoon.
Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armorer, who loaded the gun the day of the shooting and was responsible for weapons on the set of the western, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the case. One of her lawyers, Jason Bowles, said that the charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed remained.
Filming on the movie is set to resume this week in Montana, where the production has moved from New Mexico. The revived production has Ms. Hutchins's widower, Matthew Hutchins, as an executive producer.
After the news of the decision on Thursday, Mr. Baldwin posted a photo of himself and his wife on Instagram, writing, "I owe everything I have to this woman." He added, "(and to you, Luke)," apparently referring to one of his lawyers, Mr. Nikas.
While Mr. Baldwin maintained that he never pulled the trigger, the district attorney, Ms. Carmack-Altwies, a Democrat who was elected in 2020, said when announcing the charges that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun had shown "conclusively" that the trigger had been pulled. But a person with knowledge of the investigation said that Mr. Baldwin's legal team had recently provided prosecutors with new evidence that the gun had been modified without his knowledge in a way that made it less safe to handle.
The decision to dismiss the charges was the latest in a series of setbacks for the prosecution. After the charges against Mr. Baldwin were downgraded, Andrea Reeb, the special prosecutor originally appointed to handle the case, stepped down after his lawyers argued that her appointment violated a provision in the State Constitution that bars officials from serving in two branches of government, since she is also a state lawmaker.
A judge then ruled that Ms. Carmack-Altwies could not appoint any special prosecutor without recusing herself from the case. So she stepped down from the case last month, appointing Ms. Morrissey and Jason Lewis, New Mexico lawyers, as special prosecutors.
Investigators were not able to determine how live ammunition got onto the "Rust" set. Mr. Baldwin has said that he was following direction as he practiced drawing the gun that day.
"Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property," Mr. Baldwin said in a television interview on ABC less than two months after the shooting. "Someone is responsible for what happened, and I can't say who that is, but I know it's not me."
When her office announced that it was bringing manslaughter charges against Mr. Baldwin in January, Ms. Carmack-Altwies said that he had "an absolute duty to know that what is in the gun that is being placed in his hand is safe" -- an assertion that was questioned by some actors, armorers, union leaders and others in the film industry.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing film, television and radio workers, said in a statement at the time that her "contention that an actor has a duty to ensure the functional and mechanical operation of a firearm on a production set is wrong and uninformed" and added that "an actor's job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert."
The movie's first assistant director, Dave Halls, who had oversight of safety on the "Rust" set, reached a plea deal with Ms. Carmack-Altwies and Ms. Reeb on a charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to six months of probation.
A judge in New Mexico will decide next month whether the manslaughter charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed should move forward. Her lawyer has said she intends to plead not guilty.

Devastation in One Turkish Historic District: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Times examined what's left of one of the oldest streets in Antakya, a southern Turkish city, after a massive earthquake and aftershocks reduced it to rubble. Called Saray Street by locals, the stretch was once lined with more than 70 shops, restaurants and other businesses.
Drone footage taken less than three weeks after the earthquakes shows the ruins of what used to be a vibrant main corridor in the heart of Antakya's Old City, a commercial and religious hub. Some buildings are still standing, but most will need to be rebuilt.
Among the ruined businesses is Antik Beyazit Hotel, which billed itself as "Hatay's first historical boutique hotel." Originally built as a mansion in 1903, it featured exquisite décor, a large chandelier and bright guest rooms.
Verde, a barbershop, doubled as a "therapy room" for customers, who would come to talk about everything from their private lives to sports, said Sabahattin Toksay, the owner since 2000. He provided "special shaves" for generations of families -- grandfathers and their grandsons.
Officials said shortly after the earthquakes that at least 80 percent of all buildings in Antakya would need to be demolished. Across Turkey, more than 50,000 people have died and more than 1.5 million people have been displaced.
The destruction on Saray Street is a fraction of all that was lost in Old City. It was Antakya's anchor -- bringing residents together for dining, shopping, gathering and praying.
Narrow streets like Saray had cul-de-sacs with some of the area's finest restaurants serving local cuisines and desserts, like knafeh, a sweet cheese pastry. It was "the gastronomy market of Antakya," said Esra Yuksel, who co-owned Barudi Cafe.
Not far from Saray, Kurtulus Street is another commercial hub that was destroyed by the earthquakes. Stretching a mile, it had several shops, restaurants and hotels.
Beyond its shops and restaurants, Old City had important religious and cultural institutions. Among the places that are now gone and may never be restored are: the Antakya Protestant Church; the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch; Antakya Synagogue; and Habibi Neccar Mosque, which is one of the first mosques in the Anatolia region, an area that spans most of Turkey.
Many residents and business owners had taken great pride in Old City's multicultural alliances and embrace of various cultures.
"Here, there's a church, there's a mosque, and there's a synagogue," said Ozgur Akseven, 34, who owned Eva Lounge Cafe, a restaurant with live music near Saray Street. "In the community, we are Armenian, we are Christian, we are Muslim, we are Jewish. We are human all together."
When the church bell rang, Mr. Akseven said, his lounge would stop the music, and everyone would stop drinking for about 45 minutes to show respect.
Mr. Akseven, who had returned to retrieve his scooter from the rubble in late February, spoke of his family's connection to the neighborhood. "Even my father's father has some memories in here. This is real history," he said, adding that "the identity of Antakya was erased" with the earthquakes.
For Dr. Ilke Eraslan, 24, Old City was an important place she visited often with her family. "It was good before," she said, "but we didn't understand before we lost our city how important it was to us."
But Antakya, formerly called Antioch, is no stranger to disaster. Since its birth, it has rebuilt itself over and over, emerging resilient every time.
"The community always came back stronger from each disaster," said Andrea U. De Giorgi, an author of "Antioch: A History," and a professor of classical studies at Florida State University.
Rebuilding and restoring all that was lost in Old City may take many years.
"We have a long road ahead of us," said Deniz Ozturk, a restoration expert and volunteer working on the ground in Antakya.
For now, what was once a vibrant part of the Old City sits eerily empty. Bedel Saget and Anjali Singhvi reported from Antakya, Turkey. Drone footage by Sergey Ponomarev. Maps by Scott Reinhard.

Adams Backs Free Buses, But Idea Faces Difficulties: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mayor Eric Adams has voiced support for the idea. But planning and funding such a venture will be difficult, some experts say.
Free bus service could come to 10 bus routes in New York City under a proposal by state lawmakers to lure more riders to the city's struggling transit system and help those who cannot afford to pay the $ 2.75 fare.
Two bus routes in each of the city's five boroughs would be designated for a free bus pilot program, according to the proposal, which is being pushed by state legislative leaders in budget negotiations. Though the routes have not yet been chosen, one in each borough has to serve a low-income community and the other a commercial corridor.
On Tuesday morning, Mayor Eric Adams voiced his approval of the pilot program in a video posted on Twitter and Instagram by Assemblyman Zohran Kwame Mamdani, a Queens Democrat and a sponsor of the proposal.
"I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free," the mayor said in the video, adding that it would have a major impact on the city. "Our transit system is the lifeblood of our city. I use it all the time. Let's see if we can get this over the hump."
Though the city's subway and bus ridership has gradually recovered from the height of the pandemic in 2020 -- when it fell more than 90 percent from prepandemic levels -- it has not fully rebounded as commuting patterns have changed and many now work from home.
On Monday, there were about 1.3 million bus riders citywide, or 59 percent of the prepandemic ridership, according to the latest data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state authority that runs the subways and buses.
"Ridership has plummeted," said State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens, who is a sponsor of the proposal. "We're all trying to get people back into the buses and on the trains."
But John J. McCarthy, a spokesman for the M.T.A., cautioned that "very real trade-offs" would have to be considered in foregoing bus fares.
"We would have to study any impacts on the M.T.A'.s operating budget, as well as on the M.T.A.'s daily operations," Mr. McCarthy said.
The move toward free bus service has increasingly gained traction around the country. After Kansas City went to free bus service in 2020, ridership increased, but the cost of lost revenue has fluctuated between $ 8 and $ 10 million, said Cindy Baker, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority.
Ms. Baker said that the authority is paying for the bus service with $ 4.8 million provided by the Kansas City municipal government, as well as emergency pandemic funding, which will run out at the end of 2023. "We're trying to work on partnerships from within the private sector" to continue the free service, Ms. Baker said.
Boston also rolled out a free bus program on three of its routes in March of 2022, expanding an existing pilot. Since then, ridership has increased seven percent across all three routes.
"The time for free buses already arrived," said State Senator John Liu, another Queens Democrat who supports the proposal. "Many other major cities have already adopted the approach."
The pilot program for New York City evolved from a more ambitious proposal by Mr. Gianaris and Mr. Mamdani in December, calling for phasing in free bus service citywide by 2027, beginning next year in the Bronx.
In the meantime, Mr. Gianaris said, the pilot program was "a step toward evaluating how great an idea it is," and if successful, could be expanded to other bus lines.
The cost of the pilot program is projected to be $ 50 million from lost revenues -- or about $ 5 million per bus line, according to state lawmakers. Mr. Gianaris said that would be covered by other measures state lawmakers are considering, like increasing an existing surcharge on corporate profits in the region.
Some transportation experts have questioned whether free bus service is the most effective way to increase ridership and help low-income commuters.
Zhan Guo, an associate professor of urban planning and transportation policy at the New York University Wagner School of Public Service, said that free bus lines could help subway-starved, low-income communities where residents are "captive bus riders." But he suggested free transit cards might also be an option.
As for the pilot program, Mr. Guo hopes the free routes will not be selected merely "in a symbolic way." Otherwise, he added, "you might not end up serving the people you wanted to serve."

Full text: Announcing his long-shot bid to challenge President Biden, he spoke to a crowd of people who voiced their shared skepticism about vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry.
More than half a century after his father sought the White House to end a calamitous war in Vietnam and to salve the country's racial wounds, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a presidential campaign on Wednesday built on re-litigating Covid-19 shutdowns and shaking Americans' faith in science.
Mr. Kennedy, a California resident, traveled to Boston, once the citadel of his family's power, to declare that he would challenge President Biden for the Democratic nomination in a long-shot bid for the White House.
Appearing at the Park Plaza Hotel -- a favorite fund-raising venue of his uncle Ted Kennedy's -- he sought to wrap himself in the Kennedy political luster.
The event was saturated, in words and images, with reminiscences of Mr. Kennedy's father as well as another uncle, President John F. Kennedy.
In a rambling speech lasting nearly two hours, Mr. Kennedy, 69, evoked his father's 1968 campaign and death, and spoke in detail about his career as an environmental lawyer decades ago. He also aimed criticisms at the pharmaceutical industry, big social media companies that he accused of censorship, Mr. Biden's commitment to the war in Ukraine and former President Donald J. Trump's "lockdown" of the country early in the pandemic.
"This is what happens when you censor somebody for 18 years," Mr. Kennedy said, a reference to his complaint that social media platforms and the mainstream media have not given him a fair hearing. "I got a lot to talk about. They shouldn't have shut me up for that long because now I'm really going to let loose on them for the next 18 months. They're going to hear a lot from me."
Late in his speech, an alarm sounded and an announcement asked people to evacuate. Nobody moved. "Nice try," Mr. Kennedy said, and continued to speak.
Numerous attendees, who had come from Boston, neighboring New England states and Florida, recounted in interviews their skepticism about vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry.
While polls show that up to half of Democrats want someone besides Mr. Biden as their 2024 nominee, no party leader has stepped up with a challenge, and past opponents have rallied to the president's side. Mr. Kennedy is the latest in a history of fringe presidential aspirants from both parties who run to bring attention to a cause, or to themselves.
For Mr. Kennedy, that cause is vaccine skepticism, which he cloaked in terms of truth-seeking and free speech, a crusade that in the past led him to falsely link childhood vaccines to autism. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, he sought to undermine public trust in vaccines, comparing government efforts to impose mandates in some places to "Hitler's Germany." Both Facebook and Instagram took down accounts of a group he runs for spreading medical misinformation.
Family members have accused Mr. Kennedy of sowing distrust in the science behind vaccines. His campaign has appalled members of his famous Democratic clan.
"I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the Covid pandemic, vaccinations and the role of social media platforms in policing false information," Kerry Kennedy, a sister of Mr. Kennedy's, said in a statement.
Bob Shrum, a former aide to Ted Kennedy, said Mr. Kennedy's attacks on Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and the federal government's top medical and scientific agencies would have infuriated his uncle. "It's contrary to everything his uncle Ted Kennedy ever did," he said. "He called health care the cause of his life."
In a statement of his own, Mr. Kennedy said he had made a "difficult choice to put my principles ahead of my personal affections" for Mr. Biden. "Some members of my family agree with me and others do not," he added. "I bear them no ill will."
On Wednesday in Boston, Mr. Kennedy was introduced by his wife, Cheryl Ruth Hines, an actress, and he pointed out his children and grandchildren seated in a balcony of the hotel ballroom. But there was a notable absence of members of his family who have made careers in politics. A number of them affirmed their support for Mr. Biden's re-election in recent days, part of a decades-long alliance between the Biden and Kennedy families.
Ted Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, is Mr. Biden's ambassador to Austria. Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President Kennedy, is ambassador to Australia. And Joe Kennedy III, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, is Mr. Biden's special envoy to Northern Ireland, who flew with him this month to Belfast.
Though his campaign is unlikely to pose a serious threat to Mr. Biden, the strength of emotions expressed by his supporters on Wednesday pointed to a group that is angry and distrustful of traditional Democrats when it comes to vaccines. Any link between childhood vaccines and autism has been widely rebuked by peer-reviewed scientific studies. Covid vaccines, which have been administered to millions of Americans, are safe and effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Nonetheless, misinformation about vaccines swirls online.
Attendees, echoing Mr. Kennedy, took aim at a corrupt alliance of big business and government.
"The Covid vaccines are not effective and not safe," maintained Claire Mortimer, 69, a nurse practitioner who drove from Brooklin, Maine, to hear Mr. Kennedy. "I believe that only Bobby Kennedy Jr. is capable of getting rid of the corruption that is so deeply embedded in every agency of our government."
Andy Migner, 67, who works in regenerative healing in Boston, described herself as a "lifetime Democrat" who now feels politically homeless. She said "our ability to question," as well as journalism and public debate, "has gone down the tubes."

Apple Opens Its First Store Within India: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tim Cook, the chief executive of the iPhone maker, visited Mumbai to inaugurate the store. Apple is pushing to expand its market share in India, as well as shift some production there.
Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, visited India this week to open the company's first two Apple stores there: The biggest public company in the world is finally opening its first retail outlets in the world's most populous country.
Roaring crowds of would-be customers greeted him in Mumbai on Tuesday at a sleek glass-and-timber flatiron of a storefront, called Apple BKC, in the Bandra Kurla Complex. On Thursday, Mr. Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital's biggest mall.
The Apple brand is not new to India. But for the past 25 years -- marked this week, in fact -- Apple has relied solely on third-party sellers to get its products into the hands of Indian consumers. The iPhone is still a rare sight within the ocean of cheaper, and mostly Chinese-branded, Android smartphones that have swept across India over the past decade. Yet in India, as in nearly every other part of the world, Apple has its fans. Some of the most ardent were at the Mumbai opening, screaming their support.
And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren't helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself -- and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail.
"I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly -- who does that?" Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. "I don't see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future."
India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India's, has two.
But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India's.
In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company's market share in India has been growing rapidly. The iPhone 13 is the best-selling model in the premium segment, which includes phones that cost above 30,000 rupees, or $ 365. Last year, only 11 percent of the market was considered premium, but it was the fastest-growing segment.
The Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi sold the most phones in total, and the South Korean giant Samsung, which competes at different price points, had the highest value of sales, according to Counterpoint Research.
But Apple faces a consumer-pricing puzzle in India. Unlike a McDonald's, for example, Apple's signature products need to sell for roughly the same price everywhere (or else they would fly around the world, unlocked, on the black market). But the difference between marketing utility goods and luxury products becomes jumbled in the Indian context. In the Saket mall, called Select CityWalk, a bubble of air-conditioning and chromed shopfronts are across the road from a medieval warren; the Apple store is opposite a Krispy Kreme. Outposts of Chanel and Van Heusen are nearby.
Price hits differently in a country where the top 10 percent income bracket begins at 25,000 rupees, or $ 304, per month -- well under half the cost of a new iPhone. For many millions of wealthy Indians, that is perfectly acceptable. And even for those whom it stretches, it can be a price worth paying.
"It's simple: For me, it's a status symbol," said Subodh Sharma, who earns exactly 25,000 rupees per month working for a construction company. "The message that goes out to the peer and society is that, look, this person is not totally third-class," he said, glancing down at the iPhone tucked into his shirt pocket.
Mr. Sharma's partner, Bhawana, however, disagrees with his assessment. An iPhone is "not worth it," she said, right after Mr. Sharma took her photo in front of the store in Delhi. "It's uselessly costly, and its storage is small and battery life even worse." She prefers the Chinese-made Oppo phone she has been using for four years. (She earns 18,000 rupees per month at her job.)
Apple's formidable ecosystem is bound to spread more slowly in a place where the iPhone remains out of reach for so many. Kunal Dua, who runs a pharmaceutical business, recently converted his wife, Gagan Deep Kaur, to the iPhone -- but only halfway. She uses it for her Instagram account and other parts of her online social life, but she stays on her Android for work.
"Most people working under us come from lower-income groups and cannot afford an iPhone," Mr. Dua said. "So sharing media and files becomes difficult."
The relationship between Apple and India is evolving quickly. The part that matters most may have less to do with India's consumers than with the country's growing role as a production hub.
Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway "since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head." They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple's products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, "with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice."
That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that "given Apple's size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions," noting that the company has catalyzed China's growth. "We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops."
Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers.
During the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city's "incredible energy, creativity, and passion."
His fans in India were already delighted to see more of his company in their country. They may now hope that even more multinational executives follow his lead.

Full text: Between walking the dog and Zoom workouts, Erica Schwartz Werber gets the family to stop and smell the Late Fees at the Library.
Literie Candle got its start capturing nostalgic New York scents: Hot Roasted Nut Cart, Bodega Coffee, Afternoon in Central Park, and Soft Serve From the Corner Truck. "These core, cultural moments really impacted me and created memories that only take place here," said Erica Schwartz Werber, who spent some of her childhood in New York, and who started the company two years ago, at the height of the pandemic. "They're scented reminders of why New York is so great and why so many of us stayed."
Other city scents include I Ran the Marathon (notes of oakmoss and amber), Brunch in the West Village (citrus and Champagne) and Late Fees at the Library (featuring the scent of paper and linen). The candles, which also offer fragrances outside of New York (Cherry Blossoms at the Capitol) are sold at Macy's and Anthropologie, as well as at smaller stores across the city.
Ms. Werber, 42, lives on the Upper West Side with her husband, Yaron Werber, 51, a managing director at a bank, their two children, Ella, 15, and Jed, 12, and their lagotto Romagnolo, Leo.
COFFEE ZONE I naturally wake up at 6:30. I'll go into the kitchen while my husband and children sleep and grind beans in our Cuisinart. For the last four years we've belonged to a coffee club. They send a box every month from an independent purveyor. This month it's Zero Prophet Coffee from Washington, Conn. They roast the coffee in their garage, which I love. I have a Holly Hunt chair with a rounded back that perfectly curves to your body so you feel like you're being hugged. I like to sit in it. So does our dog, who I have to kick out. It's comical that he sits in the most expensive chair we own. I scroll through TikTok and zone out as I look at other people's lives.
MORNING SHIFTS By 7:30 my husband is up. We put on our workout clothes and walk Leo through Riverside Park. Yaron likes a proper latte, which we get at Peaky Barista. Then it's a trip to Absolute Bagels. Everyone eats something different. My son is up by the time we're back. My daughter will sleep for another hour. We figure out what the rest of the day looks like. Then we negotiate who will take the dog for a walk. I usually lose that battle.
SWEAT During Covid I started doing a 45-minute Zoom work out called Fhitting Room. It's high-intensity interval training with the same instructor, Ben Lauder-Dykes. Everyone can see everyone. I know the people in the group, but I don't know them. Sometimes my best friend and her husband will be in the class. We text each other before or during, so that's fun.
HALLWAY HUG We leave for the afternoon. When the four of us are waiting for the elevator, there's an authentic laugh that comes out of my children's mouths, which I cherish. It's the sweetest sound. I hug them because it's a moment when we're present. It makes me exhale. Because no one is in the hallway, they hug me back.
PIZZAS OF NEW YORK My husband started following Josh Beckerman, the Foodie Magician, on Instagram. He's a restaurant connoisseur and illusionist. They started direct messaging each other. Josh sent him a list of 30-plus pizza places to try. Over the last year we have tried to visit one or two places on Sundays. Some restaurants we can have a glass of wine and relax; others you just grab a slice and go. We've gone to all the boroughs. So far, Leo in Williamsburg has been my favorite. I'm a huge pizza lover. I like sweet sauce, thin crust and a lot of cheese. I don't like the overly thick crust or Detroit style.
THE HUNT We walk around the neighborhood looking for ice cream or something sweet. My husband likes to Yelp dessert places in the area and find out if the reviews and results were on par. We found a great place in Queens, the Astoria Bakery Cafe, and the Brooklyn Farmacy and Soda Fountain, which makes crazy ice-cream sundaes. It's about the experience and the hunt.
ACTIVITIES We're home by 4. My son plays Forza Horizon 5, which is a racecar video game, on his headset with friends. Yaron and I catch up on the week ahead. There are swim meets and dinners and school events. We do a FreshDirect order; they have their own banana bread that the kids love.
A FAMILY THAT SNIFFS TOGETHER Then we all smell five or six candle samples that have come in. We're working on a hot chocolate and whipped cream, reminiscent of ice skating in Central Park or Bryant Park. Everyone gives an opinion. My husband has a great nose and takes it seriously. He has coffee beans in between to cleans the nose palate. My daughter usually says: "Oh, my God, I love it. Can I keep it in my room?" My son always says, "It smells like soap."
BONDING We do an early dinner at 6:30 with our best friends, Jackie and Jason Halper. They live a few blocks away and their children, Ben and Ella, are the same age as ours. It's a connective way to end the weekend and is reminiscent of how I grew up with Sundays ending with friends and family. We do Chinese, Ollie's To Go Upper West Side -- dumplings, lo mien, fried rice and egg rolls, something tofu for my husband -- or Indian from Aangan Indian Cuisine. I like having close friends at this age who share what they're struggling with. Both our mothers are widowers. We're raising teenagers in New York. It can all be a lot.
ON THEIR OWN We clean up. The kids finish homework. My daughter Facetimes with a camp or school friend. They don't need me in the evenings anymore.
DOWN, OUT I'm in bed by 9:30. I'm so tired. A lot runs through my mind all day. I'm an anxious person. I might watch something on HBO, I just finished the "The Last Of Us." Zombies aren't my thing. It was more about human relationships, which I love. I hit the pillow hard and I'm out. I can sleep in an M.R.I. machine.

A Bumper Crop of Blooming Wildflowers: [Travel Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With the arrival of spring, there's a silver, or really, a multicolored lining to the extreme weather that has battered the west all winter: the promise of wildflower-filled weeks and months ahead, particularly in Southern and Central California and Arizona's Sonoran Desert.
"We are anticipating a good to better-than-average wildflower bloom," said Jorge Moreno, an information officer for California State Parks. Conditions are similarly favorable to the east, according to Michelle Thompson, chief of communications for Arizona State Parks and Trails.
The winter's precipitation has led to whispers of a "super bloom" this spring, similar to the frenzy of wildflowers that carpeted the California and Arizona desert in the winter and spring of 2019.
There's only one problem with that: "There is no universally accepted definition of a super bloom by the scientific community," said Ana Beatriz Cholo, a spokeswoman for the Pacific West region of the National Park System, adding that some definitions focus solely on desert blooms, while others simply refer to an above-average profusion of spring blooms. "But most folks will agree that a super bloom entails an unusually large and colorful display of wildflowers that result from substantial and well-timed rains."
The bottom line: 2023 is shaping up to be an outstanding spring for wildflowers. Some spots will hit super-bloom levels, though they are unlikely to be as widespread as in 2019.
Be prepared for crowded conditions at some wildflower destinations, and be certain to practice leave-no-trace principles -- stay on designated trails and roads, pack out all trash and don't trample or pick flowers in your quest for a perfect photo. Walker Canyon in Lake Elsinore, Calif., is currently closed to visitors after suffering damage as a major destination during the 2019 super bloom.
Check the Theodore Payne Foundation Wildflower Hotline for bloom updates in Southern and Central California, and both California and Arizona provide updated wildflower reports for their state parks. For all destinations, visit park websites when planning your visit for more flower updates, safety tips and more.
Here are 10 destinations for bloom-seekers to visit in California and Arizona, listed roughly from north to south in each state.
California
Carrizo Plain National Monument
What: A swath of grassland in the center of Central California just over an hour from San Luis Obispo, Carrizo Plain National Monument is shaping up to have a particularly stunning year for wildflowers, with hillside daisies, baby blue eyes and phacelia already blooming and more to come.
When: While there are already ample blooms to be found, park officials are expecting the flowers to peak in the coming weeks and last through the month, depending on weather. Visit the park's website and social media for updates on flowers and the condition of roads, some of which have been rendered impassable by recent storms.
Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve
What: An hour-and-a-half north of Los Angeles, the grasslands of the Mojave Desert come alive with golden orange California poppies, along with filaree and goldfields.
When: The poppies are in bloom, with more anticipated in the coming weeks; expect to find blooms in the reserve from early- to mid-May. You can check on the up-to-the-minute bloom status via the park's live poppy cam, and be sure to drive with caution on Lancaster Road; erratic driving and random stops for photos are to be expected, according to the park's website.
Channel Islands National Park
What: This stunning string of islands off the coast of Oxnard and Ventura is a destination for largely untouched wilderness, and is accessible via a one- to four- hour ferry ride with a park service contractor or private watercraft. Look for lupines, goldfields, blue dicks and giant coreopsis.
When: Bloom timing differs across the five islands, since each has a unique environment. Santa Barbara Island is expecting blooms from mid-April to early May, while San Miguel Island should bloom in early May. Visit dedicated island websites for more information.
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area
What: Hugging the California coast north of Malibu and easily accessible from Los Angeles, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is expecting to have a super bloom, of sorts, with a wide variety of flowers, including white popcorn flowers, cream chaparral yucca flowers, purple lupines and more.
When: Blooms, including poppies, sunflowers and Mariposa lilies, are already popping up amid the mountains, which are lush and green from the extensive rains. Expect flowers to peak this month and into May, with some higher elevation areas blooming into the summer months. Check the What's Blooming newsletter from the park for updates.
Chino Hills State Park
What: Tucked in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains just east of Los Angeles, and about an hour's drive away, Chino Hills State Park is a much-photographed destination for hills lush with orange California poppies, plus black mustard, school bells, Canterbury bells and arroyo lupine.
When: The park is in bloom. Expect flowers through early- to mid-May. Check the park website for flower news and park updates; recent storms have caused extensive trail closures.
Cabrillo National Monument
What: San Diego's Cabrillo National Monument, which commemorates where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first stepped on the West Coast of the United States (the first European to do so), is also a bona fide flower destination. It perches on the tip of the Point Loma Peninsula, and visitors to the park can look for bush sunflowers, Indian paintbrush, sea dahlias and more.
When: Blooms are approaching their peak. Study up using the park's plant field guide, or download a dedicated app. Passionate wildflower enthusiasts can become a park volunteer and help with native plant preservation and propagation (email to learn more).
Anza-Borrego Desert State Park
What: California's largest state park, Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, is two hours east of San Diego and is a frequent destination for wildflower viewing. The desert climate allows for some of the earlier blooms in California, including desert primrose, desert sunflower and blooming cactuses.
When: Because of the park's size, different sections get different amounts of rainfall. Parts of the park are already in bloom, and you can expect to find pockets of flowers through the spring and into early summer. Check the park's website for wildflower updates and photos.
Arizona
Lost Dutchman State Park
What: Forty miles east of Phoenix, at the base of the Superstition Mountains, Lost Dutchman State Park is named for a storied, vanished gold mine and is home to a variety of beautiful desert flowers, including chuparosa, lupines, fiddlenecks and Patagonia lilies.
When: The park started blooming in mid-March. Visit the park's Facebook page for weekly updates.
Picacho Peak State Park
What: About 75 miles south of Phoenix and 40 miles north of Tucson, Picacho Peak State Park boasted a true super bloom in March, with blankets of yellow poppies and purple lupines cascading down the mountain.
When: While the super bloom has passed and the poppies are fading, visitors can still find plenty of flowers in the weeks to come.
Catalina State Park
What: Just outside of Tucson, Catalina State Park is crouched at the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains and is a year-round destination for cactuses and desert plants, which are particularly stunning in bloom.
When: Cold weather has delayed the flowers at this park a bit, but blooms are now happening in earnest. Visit the park's Facebook page for the latest.

Full text: Makoto Shinkai's latest animated film, about a girl who accidentally unleashes chaos over Japan, is at once mythical and thoroughly modern.
Makoto Shinkai is often praised as a descendant of the great Hayao Miyazaki for his masterly animation, and his latest film, "Suzume," is no exception. The film speaks the same cinematic language, employing an ethereal, emotive color palette that enlivens every splash of water and blade of grass.
You can spot Miyazaki's influence in more than just the visuals. There are familiar symbols and themes: The portal doors, the cursed male hero and a few narrative moves in the resolution all scream Miyazaki's "Howl's Moving Castle," while the exploration of memory and grief mirrors his "Spirited Away."
I'll stop the Miyazaki comparisons there because Shinkai showcases plenty of his own narrative and directorial signatures in "Suzume." He's created a thoroughly modern world of both old and new forms of magic, of spells and old gods and of Instagram posts and texts. Like a locomotive chugging uphill, the story's stakes are quickly raised to the scale of natural disasters and mythical phenomena, while Shinkai puts an emphasis on specific towns and regions in Japan, grounding us in the real world even as he whisks us away to other worlds.
What's particularly exciting in "Suzume" is the story's start. Seventeen-year-old Suzume wakes up from an otherworldly dream and heads off to school. On the way, she encounters and tries to follow a mysterious stranger named Souta but ends up in the ruins of an old resort, where she stumbles upon a free-standing door floating in a shallow bank of water. She opens it, and soon flaring wind, flying debris and massive red tendrils reach out and consume the darkening skies of Japan. This is only 10 minutes in. Shinkai doesn't give you a chance to gauge your interest in its story; he immerses you immediately in the movie's mythos and spells so that you have no choice but to offer your attention.
At the ruins, Suzume finds out she has unwittingly released a cute but troublesome cat-god that Souta calls the keystone, which caused the door to unleash a monstrous earthquake-causing beast beneath Japan. Souta is a "closer," someone who finds and shuts doors to prevent such destruction -- but the keystone has transformed him into a sentient three-legged chair to prevent him from completing his mission. Suzume must then help Souta in an odyssey across Japan, making new friends while the two race to stop a catastrophic equivalent to the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's not just the drama that works. Shinkai delivers hilarious physical comedy in the awkward gambols and leaps of Souta the three-legged chair -- a refreshing reversal of the trope of the handsome young love interest who leads the naïve girl on a journey. Shinkai is nothing if not a sentimental director, but here, instead of making the flirtation between Suzume and Souta the film's emotional crux, thankfully he focuses in on the relationship between Suzume and her mother, a nurse who died in the aftermath of an earthquake when Suzume was 4.
Though the film does work as a metaphor about growth and loss, it never elaborates the rules of its world, which detracts from the narrative. The film, like Shinkai's last, "Weathering With You," can't decide if it wants to be an outright climate change parable or just a fictional story that references real climate disasters. Inspired by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, "Suzume" doesn't fully square its mythology with those real environmental tragedies -- or with humanity's accountability in the inevitable monstrous acts of the natural world -- and what this all means for the film's plot and resolution. Unclear character motivations and murky magical logistics raise more questions than provide answers.
Which is what makes "Suzume" a fascinating, frustrating film. It doesn't fulfill the promise it made in that truly stellar first act: to launch us into an adventure that crosses regions and planes but lands us steady back on our feet.

Where Trends Dance With National Security: [National Desk]

Full text: Amid talk of a nationwide ban, a reporter discussed the future for TikTok and its Chinese owner, ByteDance, in the United States.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
A social media app once known for cat videos and dance challenges has become a political flashpoint among Washington lawmakers.
In March, the Biden administration ordered that TikTok, a platform with more than 150 million users in the United States, be removed from federal government-issued devices, over concerns with the app's handling of sensitive user data. Citing national security concerns, the administration later demanded that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, sell the app or potentially face a full ban in the United States.
Last month, in a tense congressional hearing, politicians grilled TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, about the company's ties to the Chinese government, the handling of its users' data and concerns about children and teens who use the app. In the aftermath of the hearing, passionate TikTokkers came to Mr. Chew's defense and he went viral on his own platform.
Sapna Maheshwari, a business reporter at The New York Times who writes about TikTok, covered the roughly five-hour hearing, and has since reported on China's response to American scrutiny of the app. In an interview, which has been edited, Ms. Maheshwari discussed her reporting, Washington's suspicions and what happens next.
What were your takeaways from the hearing on March 23?
I was really struck by the harsh tone lawmakers took with Shou Chew. It seemed like the 50-plus lawmakers who questioned him were interested in using their five minutes to either express an opinion they had about TikTok or pursue a very specific line of questioning that matters to their constituents. It was quite aggressive, and showed that there's not a lot of love for TikTok in our government right now.
How much of the of that skepticism do you believe is tied to anti-China sentiments among politicians right now?
No politician is going to be faulted for being too tough on China right now, and that is definitely part of what's going on. But there's certainly a fair bit of criticism from lawmakers that could apply to other social media companies. TikTok's C.E.O. really tried to defend the platform by bringing that up several times. If you're talking about anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues among teenagers who use TikTok, it is reasonable to bring up similar concerns with Instagram.
Similarly, with data privacy issues, TikTok's C.E.O. has repeatedly said that its user data is in an even safer position than with American technology companies. But people were really not interested in having that conversation during the hearing.
Where do you guess TikTok goes from here?
What makes this an incredibly compelling story to cover is that it is completely unprecedented in the United States. When you look to history for examples, there's never been an instance of the government trying to ban an app that 150 million Americans are using on their smartphones. A lot of this is really to be determined, which makes it an exciting beat to cover.
In the short term, the U.S. government's pace is not fast. We will see how the negotiations unfold between the Biden administration and TikTok. We've already seen a lot of concern from TikTokkers who say, "Follow me on YouTube in case it's banned" and taking different precautions. And as we reported recently, there's a new app in the works from ByteDance called Lemon8.
What do you make of Lemon8 so far? Is this an effort by ByteDance to circumvent the measures being taken against TikTok?
From what I've learned from my sources, they started talking to ad agencies about this in January. At that point in time, TikTok was nervous that they hadn't heard from the Biden administration, so there is a chance they were concerned about the future of TikTok in the U.S.
But Lemon8 seems to be a really different kind of platform -- they've positioned it as a complementary app to TikTok. There's an interesting slide that we found in our reporting of Lemon8; in its marketing materials, ByteDance showed a potential top app store chart with CapCut, their video-editing tool, TikTok and Lemon8 as the top three apps.
I think this is ByteDance undeterred, charging forward and thinking, "We're going to be the biggest and the best app maker in America."
Is there something especially challenging about covering evolving platforms like TikTok?
One of the biggest challenges with covering tech platforms is how highly tailored they are to your personal interests and your internet behavior. You don't want to put yourself into a silo, where you're missing trends that other people are seeing. I do a lot of checking in with different firms that track what's popular on TikTok, and people who represent creators.
How often do you use TikTok in your personal life? Have the privacy concerns affected the way you use TikTok?
I'm definitely logging on every day. I have seen firsthand how addicting it can be. The feed is really good at figuring out what you like right away. I have created a few accounts to vary the content.
It would be really hard to cover TikTok at this point if I never used the app. I was certainly concerned after learning of surveillance of American journalists by ByteDance employees. The company says that this is not their practice and that those were rogue employees. We'll see how the F.B.I.'s and Department of Justice's investigations pan out.

South Korean Actress, 26, Is Found Dead in Her Home: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Though the cause of the unexpected death of Jung Chae-yull was not disclosed, it has renewed concerns about mental health in the country's highly competitive entertainment industry.
A young South Korean actress still early in a promising career was found dead in her home on Tuesday, according to the production company she had been working with. Although no cause of death was disclosed, the episode has renewed concerns about the mental health of young people working in South Korea's highly competitive entertainment industry.
The actress, Jung Chae-yull, 26, is the most recent instance of the phenomenon of celebrities in their 20s dying suddenly. Some, though not all, of the cases have been acknowledged as suicide.
"Actress Chae-yull has left our side on April 11, 2023," Management S, Ms. Jung's agency in Seoul, said in a statement on Tuesday. "We pray that Chae-yull, who has always been sincere about acting, is able to rest in peace in a warm place."
Two years ago, another 26-year-old actress, Song Yoo-jung, was also found dead at her home in Seoul. Both Ms. Song and Ms. Jung's careers had begun only a few years before they died. Ms. Song's agency did not disclose the cause of her death either.
In October 2019, Sulli, 25, a member of a K-pop girl group, was found dead in her home after facing repeated instances of bullying. Officials determined it was suicide. A few weeks after that, Goo Hara, 28, another K-pop singer, was found dead in her home, and her death was likewise ruled a suicide.
"Unless the entertainment industry and media change, South Korea will be first place on celebrity suicide," one K-pop fan wrote on Twitter. South Korean authorities recently announced that instances of bullying will now be reflected on college applications, as the country struggles to put a stop to such abuse.
Ms. Jung stepped into the spotlight in 2016 in a fashion competition show in South Korea called "Devil's Runway," which grouped rookie and veteran models into teams to compete on the catwalk. She scored multiple endorsements with popular brands like Etude, a large cosmetics company in South Korea, and U.S. fashion labels such as Jill Stuart.
Ms. Jung branched out into acting in 2018, when she landed a leading role in the movie "Deep," a thriller set in the Philippines. She would go on to act in at least one more film and two series, including "Zombie Detective," which took home a prize at the 2020 KBS Entertainment Awards in South Korea.
Recently, Ms. Jung had been filming a new series called "Wedding Impossible," based on a web novel. Filming has been temporarily suspended, according to Studio 329, the company that was working with her on the project.
Ms. Jung was born in 1996 and enjoyed boxing and snowboarding, according to social media posts. Since Tuesday, fans have flooded her Instagram account to pay tribute.
"I love you, Chae-yull, I'll pray for your happiness in heaven," one fan wrote after the announcement.
Ms. Jung's family plans to hold a private funeral, according to her agency.
If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.

Vox Media Is Spinning Off NowThis, Its Viral Politics Site: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Known for its viral videos of politicians and other newsmakers, NowThis is preparing to cover the 2024 election as an independent company.
Vox Media said on Wednesday that it was spinning off NowThis, a news site whose videos regularly go viral on Instagram and TikTok, as an independent media company ahead of the 2024 presidential election.
The deal, just more than a year after Vox Media acquired NowThis, is backed by Accelerate Change, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing civic engagement among underrepresented groups. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but one person familiar with the transaction, who was not authorized to release financial details, said Accelerate Change would make a cash payment to Vox Media in addition to contributing capital to NowThis.
The spinoff allows Vox Media to reap financial benefits from NowThis without having to fund the operating cost of the news site. Vox Media will maintain several business ties with NowThis, in addition to a minority stake in the new company, Jim Bankoff, the chief executive of Vox Media, said in an interview. Vox Media will continue to sell advertising for NowThis, and one of the company's employees will join NowThis's new board of directors.
"Consolidation for consolidation's sake is not something that we at Vox Media have believed in," Mr. Bankoff said. "Our strategy has focused on constructing a best-in-class portfolio of high-quality, highly relevant properties that speak to modern audiences via modern platforms, and monetize in a diverse set of ways."
NowThis, which has 75 employees, has been ramping up to cover an election that millions of people will follow from their phones and on social media. The site's audience has been steadily growing on platforms like TikTok, where it receives an average of 70 million views a month.
"Audiences want that intimate connection to people like them talking about the issues that matter," Samara Mackereth, NowThis's editor in chief, said in an interview. "That is why video diaries, Skype interviews, to-cam explainers and op-eds really resonate with our audience."
As an independent company, the site plans to forge new partnerships, similar to ones it has with the Emerson Collective, whose investments have included The Atlantic and Axios, said Jessica Borovay, head of production and operations for NowThis. In addition to politics, it will continue to focus on coverage of climate change, abortion rights and gun legislation.
Vox Media is spinning off NowThis as the media landscape grows trickier for digital-media companies, many of which have been hurt by the recent downturn in the advertising market.
In January, Mr. Bankoff announced that the company was laying off about 7 percent of its staff, citing the possibility of a "prolonged downturn."
Vox Media's valuation in recent years has declined considerably even as the company has grown. In 2022, Vox Media acquired NowThis, as well as niche sites including the Dodo, after the purchase of New York magazine and its related sites in 2019.
But in February, as Vox Media raised $ 100 million from Penske Media, it was valued at roughly half of what it was worth in 2015.
Around the time of its fund-raising, Vox Media had been meeting with other media companies to discuss potential acquisitions or sales of some of its properties, two people familiar with the discussions said at the time.
The spinoff of NowThis provides Accelerate Change with a chance to branch out into general-interest news. Founded in 2012 by Peter Murray, who was a founder of CrowdTangle, a social-media tracking service, Accelerate Change has incubated or provided services to news sites that focus on specific communities or demographics. Among those sites are Push Black, focused on Black culture and news; Pulso, for increasing engagement in Latinx communities; and Parents Together, a parent-led news organization.
Accelerate Change is backed by prominent progressive organizations, including the Open Society Foundations, which was founded by George Soros, the billionaire investor and major Democratic political donor.
Mr. Murray said NowThis's focus on young people was a particularly appealing selling point. "It's built by and for that community, and that's really what we look for in our properties," he said.

New Dining Delights Are Closer Than You Think: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: It's closer than you think.
I have a bit of a reputation: If you're planning on going to Philadelphia, talk to Nikita. I'm by no means an expert, but I visit our sister city (brother city?) three or four times a year -- and I think you should, too!
The mental block that seems to keep many New Yorkers from heading to Philly -- besides the sports fandom -- is the distance. But by car, bus or train, it's a surprisingly easy two-hour trip, and an ideal weekend destination for the food-obsessed. This guide is not exhaustive or filled with deep cuts, but it's a starting point for what I hope will become your own love affair with one of my favorite places.
First Stop, South Philly
You may be inclined to start your day in Center City, the busy downtown area, but I recommend heading to South Philly instead. We're not going for cheesesteaks or for the heavenly South Philly Barbacoa, but for Mexican at a much newer spot, El Chingon. A few months ago, a friend invited me to lunch at the restaurant, on a quiet corner near Passyunk Square, from the chef Carlos Aparicio, a veteran of the local fine-dining scene.
El Chingon is more diner than fine dining, but it's no less exciting or delicious. The menu is rooted in the Puebla region, with shrimp and calamari aguachile, cemitas served on housemade bread, and tacos, like the arabes packed with marinated pork. I should mention that the tortillas are of the sourdough variety, which gives every bite a pleasant tang. It's also B.Y.O.B., so feel free to grab a four-pack from the nearby Cartesian Brewing to take to dinner.
If you're craving world-altering Vietnamese food, you have no choice but to visit Gabriella's Vietnam, the two-year-old restaurant from the chef Thanh Nguyen, also in South Philly. It was one of our reporter Priya Krishna's favorite restaurants of 2022, and for good reason: It has style and substance. Order the catfish hotpot with a tangy, sweet broth, and the artfully arranged water fern dumplings "topped with crackled pork and shrimp."
And on weekends, if you happen to be there, Gabriella's serves a Vietnamese-style brunch with dishes like chả lụa pork sausage on a toasty banh mi baguette, and fish-sauce-fried chicken and waffles with coconut syrup.
Fishtown Has Options
Is it time to go to Center City now? Nope, we're headed to Fishtown. Yes, this is pretty much the equivalent of telling a New York City tourist to spend the afternoon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. But like Williamsburg, Fishtown is teeming with options, which makes it a perfect place to hang out between your morning visit to the Barnes Foundation or the Eastern State Penitentiary or the Italian Market, and your evening meal.
Grab a coffee at what, I believe, is the city's largest La Colombe, or the L.G.B.T.Q.-owned Persimmon Coffee near the corner of Frankford and East Girard. Enjoy an afternoon tipple at the Middle Child Clubhouse, which has been hyped to death but really can't be beat for that liminal time of day when you have nothing to do but need a break from all the walking. (Beer heads should opt for Bottle Bar East.)
And then go to Kalaya. In a crowded restaurant scene, it stands out. A lot of that can be chalked up to its co-owner Nok Suntaranon, who is as singular as the Thai food she's known for, like duck larb salad and garlic chive rice cakes. And then you can drive or hop a bus or train home just like that -- and start planning your next visit to Philly.
In Other News ...
This week Pete Wells reviewed Hav & Mar, the newest restaurant from the chef Marcus Samuelsson of Red Rooster fame. The seafood-focused project combines Samuelsson's Ethiopian heritage with his Swedish upbringing.
Openings: The restaurant and bakery Greywind, from the chef Dan Kluger, of Loring Place, will open near Hudson Yards on Wednesday; as will Knock Knock in Long Island City, with a menu that reflects the Chinese heritage of its owners; and Revelie Luncheonette, from the team behind the SoHo bistro Raoul's, is now open on Prince Street for lunch.
Tejal Rao wrote about the world that has sprung up around the food at Disney parks, most of which is created in a "flavor lab" at Disney World.
Papaya King, the Upper East Side restaurant specializing in hot dogs and juices, will move across the street from its original location, Christina Morales reports.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A dramatization of the trial between the wives of two soccer stars is returning to the West End in London, joining TV shows, podcasts and documentaries about the high-profile spat.
With its stage transformed into a green soccer pitch, "Vardy v. Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial" at Wyndham's Theater in London last November promised its nearly sold-out audience a game, and the two women onstage were both trying to score a goal.
But as two pundits ooh'ed and aah'ed from the sidelines, the actresses sparring were not playing soccer stars but the women married to them, caught at the center of an Instagram feud turned high-profile libel case that captured the British public's attention last May and peeled back the curtain hiding the machinations of British celebrity and the glitzy world of English soccer.
"I see it as a comedy of manners," said Liv Hennessy, the writer of the play, which returns to the West End on Thursday at the Ambassadors Theater. "It's a theatrical way for us to look at the way people behave in our current society."
The play is just one recent retelling of the real-life case that became known as the "Wagatha Christie" trial, in which Rebekah Vardy, the wife of the Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, sued Coleen Rooney, the wife of the former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, for defamation. The catalyst: Rooney's accusation, on Twitter, that Vardy had leaked her personal information to the British press.
The wives and girlfriends of soccer players -- commonly known in Britain by the acronym WAGs -- have long been followed by tabloids, but Rooney's post caused an online furor. Its escalation into the legal realm led to breathless coverage, drawing in powerhouse lawyers and unearthing revelations about both women's personal lives.
The legal side of the long-running saga came to an end last July, with the High Court ruling against Vardy, saying that the reputational damage from the scandal was not libel and ordering Vardy to pay almost all of Rooney's legal costs, which amounted to about £1.7 million, or $ 1.9 million.
But the case's power as a story has lived on, with production companies, documentary makers, podcasters and journalists finding the unfolding trial and its cast of characters just too irresistible not to dissect, all helped by the availability of the weeklong case's court transcripts.
"It's the old adage of: You can't write this," said Thomas Popay, the creative director of Chalkboard TV, which produced a two-part dramatization, "Vardy v. Rooney: A Courtroom Drama," that aired on Channel 4 in Britain last December. "We literally didn't. We took the transcripts and recreated them."
Alongside the West End play and Channel 4 show, offerings for followers of the feud include a BBC podcast called "It's ... Wagatha Christie" and the Discovery+ documentary "Vardy vs Rooney: The Wagatha Trial." Rooney has signed a Disney+ deal for a three-part documentary looking at the events leading up to the trial, and the saga is reportedly being considered for a retelling as part of the series "A Very British Scandal."
"All of us can relate to the idea of being betrayed -- especially betrayed by someone who we trusted," Popay said. "And on Vardy's side -- we can all relate to not being believed."
In her 2019 social media post, Rooney described how she concocted a sting operation to reveal the betrayer by posting false stories that were visible to a single account -- Vardy's -- to test if they would turn up in The Sun, a London tabloid.
The popularity of the post led to Rooney being nicknamed "Wagatha Christie" -- a portmanteau of WAG and Agatha Christie, the mystery writer -- for her detective work. Vardy quickly denied she was the leaker and sued Rooney for defaming her.
"We are absolutely interested in people's misfortunes and what goes on in celebrity lives," said Adrian Bingham, a professor of modern British history at the University of Sheffield who has studied media and gender issues. The women's involvement with the soccer world gave their dispute resonance with a wider audience, he added, while the legal case gave the non-tabloid media a legitimate reason to cover it. Producers of the adaptations say they have asked their own lawyers to look over scripts, lest they find themselves accused of defamation.
The court transcript itself had moments and revelations that many say were ripe for re-enactment: a phone with key evidence in the form of WhatsApp messages, apparently lost to the bottom of the North Sea; lawyers in wigs formally reading out text messages from the women, some containing profanities; Vardy's tears on the witness stand after cross-examination by David Sherborne, Rooney's lawyer.
"It was positively Shakespearean in terms of how it went down," said Popay. "We decided the best thing to do and the most accurate thing to do was to completely recreate the trial by using the court transcripts verbatim." His company's show, which was commissioned in May during the trial and aired in December, drew 1.5 million viewers.
Hennessy, the writer of the West End play, also relied heavily on the court transcripts, but took liberties by leaning into the soccer world, structuring the play like a game itself. Reading the transcripts, she said she was struck by the humanity of the two women, who have both been criticized (Vardy has said that people made abusive threats toward her and her unborn baby following that fateful post, while the trial laid bare tensions in Rooney's marriage and her experience growing up with fame).
"It does ask how complicit we are in creating public figures, and tearing them down when they don't meet our standards," Hennessy said.
Even at a rehearsal in late March, before the play's official return, it was clear the trial continued to intrigue and perplex even the cast members. During a pivotal scene in which Rooney is grilled by Vardy's lawyer on precisely why she made the fateful decision to share the feud with the world, the actors broke character to pose their own burning questions: Was that decision one of a calculating woman, or a woman at a breaking point? Why had she not privately confronted Vardy? And what did it feel like to live, as they imagined Rooney did, in a world where one's image could become a public commodity?
Though celebrity gossip can be easy to dismiss as frivolous, the two opponents in the trial were both women from working-class backgrounds who laid out one aspirational pathway for others like them, said Rebecca Twomey, an entertainment correspondent who has covered both women closely.
"We like to put people on pedestals -- and bring them down," she said, adding that many people enjoyed a modern-day pantomime. "You might think they're airhead WAGs, but these are two sharp, intelligent women."
Still, the enduring appeal of the high drama of "Wagatha Christie" is also simple, Professor Bingham said.
"The reason people are telling it is not because it's insightful," he added. "It's because it's a great story -- with great lines."

Despite Fears, Palestinians Gather to Break Ramadan Fast: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A coveted Middle Eastern rice dish has become a social media star at Al Aqsa Mosque, even as tensions escalate at a site also revered by Jews.
JERUSALEM -- With under 30 minutes until sundown, Anas Shalodi hurried through the Old City's covered souk carrying a large pot, hot off the stove and wrapped in a green prayer rug, zipping past others making their way to the mosque to break their daily Ramadan fast.
In this bustling market in the heart of Jerusalem, where the smell of food and incense mingled, he passed shops and stalls selling falafel, hummus and sweet Ramadan juices. Folding chairs, blankets, prayer shawls and prayer beads were also on offer -- everything needed for iftar, the evening meal that breaks the fast, at Al Aqsa Mosque.
Mr. Shalodi, 22, was toting the month of Ramadan's most coveted meal for Palestinians: maqluba. The Middle Eastern rice dish, which translates as "upside down," plays a starring role in the Instagram and TikTok feeds of Palestinians capturing iftar.
The pot is ceremonially flipped onto a serving tray and lifted with flair to reveal the maqluba against the backdrop of the blue and gold Dome of the Rock.
The Shalodi family, residents of the Old City, had to walk mere minutes to get to the mosque, but thousands of other Palestinian Muslims come from across Jerusalem, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to break their fast picnic-style in the 35-acre Aqsa compound.
Some bring pots of steaming food, others pick up an iftar meal as they make their way through the Old City's souks and others eat from the thousands of boxed meals distributed by charities throughout the compound.
"It's a gathering place," Mr. Shalodi's mother, Seham Ghait, 53, said earlier in the day, as she fried cauliflower and potatoes for the maqluba. "I feel at peace there."
But with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan overlapping this year with the Jewish holiday of Passover, there had been widespread fears that tensions over the contested site could disrupt that peace.
On Wednesday, Israeli police raided the compound, arresting hundreds of Palestinian worshipers who had barricaded themselves inside the Qibli Mosque, one of two main prayer halls in the compound, in an effort to stay there overnight.
The raid outraged Palestinians and Muslims across the Middle East and prompted armed groups in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon to fire rockets at Israel. Israel launched airstrikes it said targeted the armed groups in southern Lebanon as well as at Hamas military sites in Gaza.
Jews revere the compound as the Temple Mount, the location of two ancient temples, considering it the holiest site in Judaism. Israeli police have increasingly allowed them to pray during visits to the compound, violating a longstanding agreement.
But when the compound is not a flashpoint in the broader Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it is a place of spirituality and community, one of the few public spaces Palestinians say they have to gather.
Mosques have long been places not only of worship but also assembly. That is especially true of Al Aqsa after Israel occupied and annexed East Jerusalem, including the Old City, a move not recognized by much of the world.
"It's the only place for the elderly and young children and everyone to gather," said Bassam Abu Lebda, who heads the office of Sheikh Azzam al-Khatib, the deputy chairman of the Islamic council that administers the mosque compound. "It is a playground and an outlet and a spiritual place to connect with God."
Samira Magadleh, 59, grew up visiting Al Aqsa with her father. This Ramadan she joined friends and relatives on a bus from their town, Baqa al Gharbiyye, bringing the faithful to the mosque.
As a Palestinian citizen of Israel who can travel easily to Jerusalem, she feels a sense of responsibility to visit regularly, especially when she meets Palestinians coming from the occupied West Bank who must cross Israeli checkpoints to get here and risk being denied entry.
"For us it is easier, no checkpoints or anything," she said as the bus drove down a highway alongside Israel's separation barrier. "I feel guilty if I don't go there and pray."
When she comes for iftar she eschews any elaborate meal. On this day she brought leftover kebabs, a carafe of Turkish coffee and a prayer rug. Breaking her fast in Al Aqsa is not about eating, she said, but just being there.
For Muslims, Al Aqsa is the third holiest site in Islam. And for Palestinians, it is a potent symbol for the broader Palestinian cause, embraced by Palestinian Muslims and Christians alike.
When her three children were young, Ms. Ghait used to bring them to the Dome of the Rock to do homework and teach them the Quran. Now she comes every morning by herself to read it.
As sundown neared, she and her children debated where to sit in the courtyard -- and where and when to do the dramatic reveal of the maqluba.
As the moment approached, Mr. Shalodi, quickly flicking his wrists, flipped the pot onto the metal tray.
"Are you going to lift it," a man came by, asking eagerly, his phone extended ready to record.
A woman approached, livestreaming.
"Not yet, with the adhan," Ms. Ghait said, referring to the call to prayer that marked the end of the day's fast.
Such scenes, shared widely on social media, inspired the Abu Hussein family to bring their own pot of maqluba to Al Aqsa.
"Mama, did you make it look nice for the picture?" Tala Abu Hussein, 17, asked her mother, referring to the chicken and vegetables that adorn the top of the maqluba and is part of the reveal once the pot is lifted. She added, "We were encouraged by other people's videos."
Despite having fasted for 14 hours, Tala was more excited about the reveal than eating. Not so her younger sister.
"Oh God, I'm so hungry," said Galia Abu Hussein, 12, lifting the lid slightly to peek inside.
The family had driven down from Baqa al Gharbiyye, 60 miles north of Jerusalem. They had left the house at 4 p.m., wrapping the maqluba pot tightly in a thick blanket. Three hours later, it was still warm.
Around them people distributed dates, bottles of water and bread.
As the call to prayer began, followed a second later by a cannon firing signaling the fast's end, Mr. Shalodi prepared to finally lift the pot.
"Lift it toward you," his mother instructed, "slowly, slowly."
"I know, Mama," he said as he knelt down, white prayer beads hung around his neck. "It's not like this is the first time I lift the maqluba pot."
Around them people began savoring their first sip of water, bite of a sweet date or drag on a cigarette. By the time the evening prayer began, less than 10 minutes later, others had nearly finished their meals.
Rows of women prayed alongside rows of men -- as everyone mostly prayed wherever they were already siting to eat -- unlike the customary gender segregation for Muslim prayer.
As the sun set, the lights in the mosque turned on, lighting the Dome of the Rock.
In less than 30 minutes, the Shalodi family was done with dinner -- speed eating being a common practice in Ramadan.
"I wish I had a hookah," Ms. Ghait joked. But that had to wait.
As the family walked from the compound and back through the souk, they passed more than a dozen men engulfed in plumes of hookah smoke.
On warm nights, Ms. Ghait takes her own hookah pipe up to the roof of their home, where she has a clear view of the illuminated golden dome.

With New Sweats, She's Getting the Last Word: [Style Desk]

Full text: Ariana Madix, a jilted lover on the popular Bravo series, didn't miss her chance to tell the world how she felt: Boys Lie.
When Ariana Madix, one of the stars of the Bravo series "Vanderpump Rules," was photographed on her way to the show's Season 10 reunion, she knew all eyes were on her. This wasn't a typical end-of-season gathering for Ms. Madix, or the rest of her cast members, for that matter -- this was guaranteed to be a day of explosive confrontation after she discovered Tom Sandoval, a co-star on the show and her partner of nine years, had a secret, six-month affair with Raquel Leviss, the couple's friend and castmate.
On the morning of March 24, Ms. Madix showed up wearing a yellow hoodie that read "1-800-BOYS-LIE" and a matching sweatpant that read in all caps, "We're sorry the number you're trying to reach has moved on."
"Ariana stepping out in that sweatsuit was such an empowering moment," said Leah O'Malley, co-founder of Boys Lie, the company that made the sweatsuit. "It was her explaining how she's feeling without even having to say the words herself."
In an emailed statement, Ms. Madix wrote: "I'm so inspired by the founders of Boys Lie, and I absolutely love the outfit. Plus being comfy is everything to me!"
Boys Lie is a Los Angeles-based loungewear company co-founded by Ms. O'Malley and Tori Robinson in 2018. Ms. O'Malley and Ms. Robinson, both 28, grew up together in suburban Philadelphia and have been friends for nearly two decades. They share a unique bond: When they were in college, they simultaneously endured breakups from serious boyfriends who were also best friends. The women found catharsis in channeling their heartbreak into a business. They said they "failed epically" trying to launch the company as a beauty brand, but noticed that people were buying the few clothing items that read "Boys Lie." With only two months of funding left before they'd have to close up shop, they pivoted to designing and selling only clothing, and it paid off.
Things started to take off in 2019 when the model Gigi Hadid wore a Boys Lie matching set that said "Goodbye" about the same time she and Tyler Cameron, a contestant from "The Bachelorette," called it quits. The company's boutique-level success was solidified. Their operation is small -- with only 12 employees working out of a house together in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles -- and in addition to its own site, its merchandise is available on Revolve, Urban Outfitters and PacSun, as well as some of the latter two's stores.
The co-founders are "Vanderpump Rules" fans and were closely following the drama around what has been deemed "Scandoval." Anyone paying any attention to the Bravo universe was shocked that Mr. Sandoval deceived Ms. Madix for months. Mr. Sandoval and Ms. Madix bought a house together, seemed seriously committed and were portrayed as one of the more stable couples on the show. On and off camera, Ms. Madix remained friendly with Ms. Leviss when others weren't always so keen on her.
The co-founders had their own plans to reach out to Ms. Madix through mutual friends when her stylist, Emily Men, directly messaged them on Instagram. The 35-year-old stylist, who's based in Los Angeles and has been styling influencers for the past eight years, said the Boys Lie brand immediately came to mind when she was planning Ms. Madix's look for the reunion, because of their reputation for being comfortable and cheeky.
"Everyone is paying attention to everything she's doing," Ms. Men said. "I thought it's just so fitting for the whole situation."
Ms. Men started working with Ms. Madix after they were introduced following BravoCon -- the annual convention the network throws publicizing their slate of reality TV shows -- last October. She styled Ms. Madix for the cast photos of the show's 10th season. Ms. Men thought about every detail of Ms. Madix's outfit for the highly anticipated reunion. Bravo posted photos of the cast members' on-air reunion outfits on Monday, and Ms. Madix's red Mônot skirt and top had made waves online. Ms. Men said she wanted Ms. Madix to appear bold and sexy, but not as if she was "trying too hard."
"I felt like it was a good way to say everything in a dress," Ms. Men said.
Ms. Robinson said that Bravo had built a cult following of fans who wanted to know every detail about the lives of its reality television stars. When Ms. Madix leans into fashion accessibility by trading a high fashion moment for a sweatsuit that's available to the masses, she can be seen as more relatable to her followers.
"People come out in Boys Lie," Ms. Robinson said, "and something that's so special about it is people wear it like it's their own armor."
Famous people, particularly women, have used their clothing to signal messages about their personal lives. In January, Hailey Bieber was photographed in a simple white T-shirt with the phrase "nepo baby." Britney Spears marked her breakup from Justin Timberlake in 2002 by wearing the now-iconic light blue T-shirt that read "Dump him" in all caps and orange letters. The tee has gone on to be duplicated by knock-off brands for the last two decades.
The "1-800-BOYS-LIE" sweatshirt and sweatpants sold out on the same day Ms. Madix wore it and is currently back-ordered, the co-founders said. Less than a week after the reunion, Ms. Madix launched her own line of merchandise, including shirts that say "Cooler than you" and sweatshirts that say "Born [expletive] cool" (references to her quips on the show over the years).
Ms. O'Malley and Ms. Robinson said that the fact that the pieces worn by Ms. Madix and Ms. Hadid immediately sold out "shows the buying power these women have." The women said they have gifted their clothes to celebrities and influencers but have never paid anyone to wear them, which makes it even more special when famous people decide to wear their brand.
"It shows brand loyalty, brand trust -- and that's something nobody can buy," Ms. Robinson said.

The Thrift Market: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: If you're lucky, you might find a vintage jacket you've been searching for, or a pair of long-lasting Levi's jeans. But you're never going to be as lucky as Dencity: the coolest of the cool kids of Lagos. These skaters, often clad in a uniform of baggy pants and crop tops, head to the market to go thrifting each week. They're armed with fashion knowledge only the young, fun and determined can possess and seek out the best streetwear they can find.
Founded by 26-year-old Blessing Ewona in 2020 in response to the dearth of spaces for young queer people and female skaters in Nigeria, Dencity skate, dream and thrift together. From their trips to the market to regular skate meet-ups at the dilapidated National Stadium or Tarkwa Bay beach, they have traced their own map of the city.
"I always wanted a community where I could just be myself," Blessing said. "Not where I have to skate all the time. An escape."
"I tried to look for one," she added, referring to a group in which she felt at home, "and then I said, let me just build my own. Not just for me, but for other people like me that also want a community like this but don't know how to go about it."
Most of the clothes that are thrifted at Yaba Market are sourced from abroad. They arrive in bales that the traders pick from and add to their own stalls, which are designed to entice people to come and buy -- wares stacked in color-coded orders or charming patterns, walkways winding through the piles. Finding a bargain is like scouring a beach for buried treasure. And the Dencity skaters know how to look.
"They have their own eyes for what they want to wear, because everybody thrifts in this market, but they still find ways to make it cool," said Stephen Tayo, the photographer for this article. "They are very in their own bubble of style. If you can influence from a space that is available to everybody, then you're special."
There's a thrill to that hunt, Blessing explained. "You have to explore the market to get what you really want," she said. "And sometimes, what we buy doesn't always make sense. We have to figure out how to style it. We're like, 'It's going to make sense one day."'
Stephanie Onyemachi, a 21-year-old member of Dencity, discovered the market through Blessing. ("Everyone's always asking me where I get my stuff," Blessing said. "I take everyone there.")
For a good haul, Stephanie usually budgets 10,000 naira, or about $ 22 -- a small fraction of her salary. "With that I can get three bottoms and about five tops," she said.
"Unlike shopping in boutiques and malls, in the market there's no gender restrictions or conforms. If I go to, like, let's say, H&M or Mr. Price, there's the male section, the kids section, the females section," Stephanie said. "But in the market, you don't have any of that. Anybody can just come and shop and find what fits them."
Like most of the members of Dencity, Stephanie, who grew up outside of Lagos, discovered the group on social media.
In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, she was stuck indoors with her family and felt trapped. But as Nigeria started to open back up, she moved to the capital and found out about the crew. It felt like a new world had been opened up to her. She bonded with them immediately and threw herself into the work of making it successful.
What began with Blessing posting photos and videos of her own skating escapades has grown in just two years to more than 90 young people from all over Nigeria, ranging in age from their late teens to mid-20s, who are part of the collective's WhatsApp group and take part in in-person events, including thrifting expeditions to the market.
"When I first started Dencity, if I wasn't there, people didn't go out to skate," Blessing said. "Now, they're so comfortable they skate any day. Sometimes I'm just sitting at home going through Instagram stories then I'm like, 'Ah! There they are."'
"It gives me so much joy. Because I really wanted for girls to be able to go out and just be themselves."
On her first day out with Dencity, "I finally felt like it was OK to be a female skater," Stephanie said. "I had been constantly told, 'Oh, this is a thing for guys.' I finally felt like I was around my people. I finally felt normal."
Dencity is helping to herald in a new era of cultural celebration that pushes up against the traditional, colonial and conservative values of Nigeria.
The majority of the people who skate with the group identify as queer -- a rarity in a society that is often openly hostile to the L.G.B.T.Q. community. A Pew Research Center study in 2020 found that only 7 percent of people in Nigeria believe that homosexuality should be accepted, and the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, passed in 2014, bans not just legal recognition of these relationships but also any outward displays of affection between partners of the same gender or meetings of official L.G.B.T.Q. organizations.
But despite the marginalization that they face, the members of Dencity, and groups like it, have been able to carve out a space of freedom and safety for themselves.
"When you're in a marginalized group -- and you're in a country that does make sure you're marginalized -- when you hear there is a safe space for you, naturally, people are going to come through. It has naturally just attracted queer people," Stephanie said. "Safe spaces for queer Nigerians were almost nonexistent 10 years ago, and even now there are only a few."
The name "Dencity" is a play on Blessing's middle name, Eden, and the crew's goal is for their events to feel like a type of paradise for all who attend.
Through the clothes they source, the stickers they use to decorate their skateboards, even the rainbow snacks they brought on a queer-inclusive beach outing, Dencity's members have carved out a space where they can be their full, authentic selves and feel "most welcome, most comfortable, doing our thing," Stephanie said.
As interest in skating across Nigeria has been growing -- there are now a number of pro skaters in the country, including Henry Okwubuasi, signed by Wafflesncream, Nigeria's first skateboarding company -- there is hope that a new generation of skaters will have access to more resources and be better equipped to represent the country on the world stage, including at the Olympic Games, which added skateboarding in 2021.
Dencity is committed to being a part of that future. "The skating community has become a space for all. They are their own government. That's what I got from them," said Stephen, the photographer. "Because when you make provision for yourself, and for people that look like you, then that's a country on its own."
"That's a government, by the people, for the people."

Full text: Yves Saint Laurent pants. A vintage mink. And plenty of advice from Stacy London, best known for hosting "What Not to Wear."
Standing outside a residential building in Brooklyn, Stacy London held up a 1960s houndstooth wool and leather coat, considered it for a moment, then whisked it away. "I feel like if I let it go, I'm going to hunt down the person who bought it and say I need it back," she explained.
The coat was not for sale. But plenty of other things were.
On a sunny but chilly Sunday afternoon, in a little brick alley marked by two elaborate hot pink plastic thrones, it was Day 2 of what Ms. London, 53, a fashion stylist and the former co-host of the TLC show "What Not to Wear," called "the garage sale to end all garage sales."
After 17 years in the same apartment, Ms. London, who has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram, was preparing to move and, she acknowledged, she had too much stuff. "As I get older, I'm resentful of how much I have accumulated," she said. "I'm actually angry about it."
Garage sales may conjure up visions of broken bicycle parts and old roller skates, but with a TV star hawking a mink coat from the 1970s priced at $ 400 and vintage Yves Saint Laurent pants for $ 100, this event had a decidedly New York flavor.
Ms. London and her friend Christene Barberich, the former editor of the fashion and style website Refinery29, had actually teamed up to sell portions of their incredibly fashionable closets before. Both are "crazy collectors" who love vintage clothing and thrift shopping, she said.
However, "I really do believe in circularity and sustainability," Ms. London said. "If I am not getting joy from something, somebody else should."
The two had sold so much on Saturday, that for Sunday, they enlisted another friend, Maayan Zilberman, an artist and former lingerie designer, who brought from her closet some one-of-a-kind pieces as well as an Alexander McQueen dress.
Most of the clothes were priced between $ 40 and $ 80, although some pieces were much more expensive (a shaggy 1960s woolen knit coat with matching hat for $ 400) and a few items were a whole lot cheaper (a $ 5 bucket hat). Ten percent of the proceeds would be split between two charities, United 4 Iran and Planned Parenthood, Ms. London said. But first they had to sell.
Ms. Barberich, who writes a newsletter about home, style and thrifting called A Tiny Apt, laid out some vintage celebrity photographs she had purchased at an antique store in California somewhere between Los Angeles and Palm Springs. There was one of Erik Estrada, smiling at fans, and another of Diana Ross, wearing a big floppy hat.
Ms. London shivered and pulled on the '70s mink. "It's still for sale," she said. "I'm just cold."
As shoppers -- some carrying dogs, some carrying babies -- crowded into the alley, Ms. London offered styling suggestions, much as she had done on her TV show.
"You're crazy if you don't get them," she told a woman clutching a pair of black cowboy boots.
"The construction is what makes it great," she instructed another woman who was inspecting the seams of a long wool dress coat trimmed in fox fur.
"You could wear it with lots of necklaces -- and no shirt," Ms. London told Rachel Sklar, a writer who was trying on a vintage double-breasted corduroy suit the color of peanut butter.
Pooja Barbhaiya, 40, held up a cream-colored 1980s Saint Laurent jacket with black satin lapels and gold buttons. "It's from the '80s," Ms. London said.
"I love the '80s," Ms Barbhaiya said with a smile.
"Who doesn't?" Ms. London replied.
Ms. Barbhaiya tried on the jacket and looked in the mirror propped against a brick wall. "I'm definitely getting this," she laughed. It was the only thing she tried on, and she left shortly after sending Ms. London $ 150 on Venmo.
As another woman shimmied into a slinky black dress that had sparkly crystal straps and a sparkly crystal belt, Ms. London spoke of its provenance: "It is a 1973 Karl Lagerfeld design, when he was designing for Chloe," she said. "I bought this in 2006. And I wore it once, when I was onstage as the spokesperson for TLC and Discovery for the up-fronts -- to get, you know, advertisers to buy ad space. It was like a dog and pony show."
The shopper turned left and right in the mirror. Ms. London warned: "You'll always regret the thing you didn't get!" Another sale was made.
Stephanie Casimir, 33, tried a dress on over her sweatshirt. "It didn't quite fit, but I ended up with this gorgeous ceramic," she said, showing off a wildly curvy vase.
What Ms. Casimir regretted was the white Céline coat her friend had snagged. "I'm jealous that she saw it first," she said.
Karen Ezra, 60, a psychologist and Queens native who has lived in Brooklyn for over 30 years, was driving by when she saw the big pink chairs and decided to stop in and see what was happening.
"I have an '80s-themed benefit at the school where I work," Dr. Ezra said, "so I had my eyes open. I was checking around at vintage shops recently for something '80s. And Stacy suggested this crazy sweater."
It was black, silver star-spangled and so totally '80s Dr. Ezra bought it. She didn't know Ms. London and Ms. Barberich, she said. "I am so not a stylish person," she insisted, but she also bought a long striped sweater and some earrings.
Before leaving, Dr. Ezra exchanged numbers with Ms. Sklar, who had also been considering the sweater. "If you ever decide you don't want it anymore, call me," Ms. Sklar said.
After 2 p.m., Ms. London, Ms. Barberich and Ms. Zilberman started packing up.
Though the Erik Estrada photo found a new home, Ms. Barberich had pocketed the Diana Ross photo: "I felt like I was going to regret it if I sold it because I would never find it again," she said.
All together they had sold 90 percent of their inventory and put most of the lower-priced items and books on the sidewalk in a box marked "Free."
And as she closed the gates to the little alley, Ms. London said there would most likely be another sale in the summer. She was still wearing the 1970s mink.

A Minimalist House to Keep the World at Bay: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: They raised six children. Now it was time for a home that was entirely their own.
Russel Davies and Wendy Wilkie were ready to start walking.
After raising six children from previous relationships in a five-bedroom converted barn in the countryside outside Aberdeen, Scotland, all the empty rooms and open spaces began to feel superfluous.
"We started thinking about what we wanted to do next," said Mr. Davies, 64, the chief executive of an oil industry company. For years, he said, "we were essentially taxi drivers for the kids -- anything we wanted to do, we had to drive."
After that, a walkable lifestyle seemed more appealing. So he and Ms. Wilkie, 55, resolved to build a small, modernist house that was entirely their own within striking distance of the center of Aberdeen, a city of about 227,000 people, roughly 130 miles north of Edinburgh.
"When we started looking at where we wanted to live, we made a list: We wanted to be in a community; we wanted to be able to walk to a pub on a Friday night; we wanted to be close to a bus route into the city," Mr. Davies said. "We wanted to be close to shops, so we wouldn't have to get in the car every time."
As they began looking for a lot, they engaged Brown & Brown Architects, a firm whose work they had admired on Instagram, to help choose the property and design the house. For a couple of years, they searched for the ideal building site, but the best lots were always too far from the city center.
Finally, in 2019, they heard about a half-acre lot on the outskirts of Aberdeen, with a dilapidated 19th-century stone coach house on it that had been converted into a home. "It had woodworm in all the roof joists, and you could have pushed in the old windows if you had wanted to," Mr. Davies said. "It was just rotten and damp."
But when Andrew Brown, who runs Brown & Brown with his wife, Kate Brown, gave his approval, the couple bought it for about 425,000 British pounds (about $ 525,000), planning to knock down the old house to make way for a new one.
"They were moving from a rural area into the city, which is the opposite of 90 percent of the projects we do," Mr. Brown said. "Traditionally, people are escaping the city. But this lot is in the west end of Aberdeen, which has nice Victorian buildings and terraced housing. It's a busy area, but one of the nicer areas, and there are not many opportunities to build a new building in a setting like that."
As it turned out, the parcel was in a conservation zone, so even if the old stone building was falling apart, they couldn't tear it down. "In general, Historic Environment Scotland doesn't want to see any buildings demolished -- even if they are crumbling and falling down, which was the case here," Mr. Brown said.
The architects proposed a compromise: They would preserve the stone wall from the old home that was closest to the busy road and incorporate it into the new house. Then they would use the stone from the building's other walls to clad a new garage and build a boundary wall by the sidewalk, which is common in the area. After nearly a year and a half of negotiation, city planning authorities approved the idea.
Brown & Brown placed the garage at the front of the lot. From there, a covered outdoor colonnade with the old stone wall on one side leads to the front door of the new 2,950-square-foot house. That passageway is "like an airlock" that keeps the outside world at bay, Mr. Brown explained. "We're trying to separate the house from everyday life a little bit."
The house itself comprises two boxes made of glass, concrete and larch-wood slats, stacked perpendicularly and topped by green roofs. On the ground floor, a kitchen with cabinets finished in composite slate fronts and a long island with a cantilevered microcement top is open to a glass-walled living room. A double-height dining area is dominated by a sculptural spiral staircase that Angus & Mack, a woodworking company, constructed from overlapping layers of birch plywood.
Upstairs, the smaller second level contains the primary suite, a guest room and a home gym. Built by the contractor Coldwells Build, the house took roughly a year and a half to complete, at a cost of about £1.2 million ( $ 1.48 million). Mr. Davies and Ms. Wilkie moved in last July.
Most of the windows in the home are positioned to offer views into the back garden or out across the green roofs, which sprout with grasses and wildflowers, and are "extensions of the garden," Mr. Brown said. "We wanted to create spaces that felt like they were in a garden rather than next to a garden."
The effect makes for "a really peaceful house," Ms. Wilkie said, especially because the stone walls protect the house from the road, creating visual and auditory privacy.
"Because of the way Andrew designed it, with the enclosed garden and the colonnade, nobody can see in, nobody can hear us, and we can't hear them," Mr. Davies said. "When you sit in the lounge and look out the windows, all you see are the trees."
The house, they agreed, captures the best aspects of rural and urban living.
"You still have that feeling of living in the countryside," Mr. Davies said. "But you walk out the door and you're two minutes from a bus stop and five minutes from the pub. It's everything we wanted."

Twitter Acts To Halt Rival In Substack: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk's company made the norm-shattering move two days after the publishing start-up Substack unveiled a Twitter-like service.
SAN FRANCISCO -- On Wednesday, the newsletter service Substack announced that it had built a Twitter competitor. On Thursday, Twitter prevented Substack writers from sharing tweets in their newsletters. And on Friday, Twitter took steps to block Substack newsletters from circulating on the platform.
Twitter's move to swat an upstart was an abrupt deviation from normal behavior among internet companies and publishers. It also provided more grist for critics who say that while Elon Musk, Twitter's new owner, has often hailed the importance of free speech, he has not shied from restricting competitors and content that he doesn't like.
The new fight with a young company is the latest controversy in Mr. Musk's chaotic ownership of Twitter, which he acquired about six months ago. He has laid off more than 75 percent of its employees, has been sued by commercial landlords for failing to pay office rent and has lost advertisers.
While Mr. Musk has long clashed with mainstream news outlets, targeting Substack largely affects independent writers, some of whom depend on Twitter to drive readers to their work.
"This is a huge inconvenience," said Hunter Harris, a writer who distributes her newsletter, Hung Up, on Substack. "It's incredibly petty."
Substack's founders, Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie and Jairaj Sethi, said in a statement that they were "disappointed" by Twitter's decision to stifle engagement with any tweets that featured a Substack link.
"Writers deserve the freedom to share links to Substack or anywhere else," they said. "This abrupt change is a reminder of why writers deserve a model that puts them in charge, that rewards great work with money and that protects the free press and free speech."
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Twitter and Substack share a major investor, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which could be called to play referee in the spat. A spokeswoman for Andreessen Horowitz, which led a $ 65 million investment round in Substack in 2021 and invested $ 400 million in Mr. Musk's Twitter last year, did not respond to a request for comment.
Substack's new feature, called Notes, mimics Twitter in several ways. It allows users to post brief updates and lets other people like, repost or reply to them. The changes by Twitter on Friday meant that Twitter users could still share links to Substack newsletters, but blocked other users from liking or resharing those links.
Before Mr. Musk acquired it, Twitter sometimes restricted likes and retweets as a way to prevent content that violated its policies from spreading widely on the platform. The measure was used to limit the reach of former President Donald J. Trump's tweets in which he made false assertions about how votes would be counted in the 2020 election.
Twitter has been an important distribution outlet for Substack authors, many of whom are independent of traditional media outlets and rely on subscriptions to make money.
Some of Substack's most popular writers have been vocal supporters of Mr. Musk, who gave them special access to comb through and release the "Twitter Files," internal communications that the billionaire said showed the biases of Twitter's previous management. One of those writers, Matt Taibbi, said in a tweet on Friday that he was "alarmed" and would leave Twitter because of its Substack restrictions and post on Substack Notes instead.
The changes outraged writers who use both Twitter and Substack to distribute their work. "I cannot explain how absurd and silly this is," Rohit Krishnan, who writes the newsletter Strange Loop Canon, wrote in a tweet. "Not to mention petty and vindictive."
Ms. Harris said that, while Twitter did not drive significant traffic to her newsletter, the restrictions penalized her readers who might want to share links to her work or discuss it on Twitter. Preventing Substack writers from including tweets in their newsletters also stripped proper credit from Twitter users, she added.
"Any Twitter alternative would be great," Ms. Harris said of Substack's move to build a competitor. "I want another place just like Twitter that's not Twitter."
Other writers said Mr. Musk's latest move contradicted his statements about enabling free speech at Twitter.
"In cutting off access to Substack, Elon is banning access to free and highly informative content on the internet," said Simon Rosenberg, who writes a newsletter on politics. "It is censorship of the very worst kind."
The Substack kerfuffle is not the first time that Mr. Musk has blocked competing services from being shared on Twitter. In December, he suspended Twitter users, including several journalists, for linking to Mastodon after a Mastodon user shared public information about the location of Mr. Musk's private jet.
He went on to bar users from sharing links to Facebook, Instagram and several other social media companies, but reversed course after a backlash. Under pressure from supporters who saw the move as an abandonment of his free speech principles, Mr. Musk said in December that he would step down as Twitter's chief executive once he found a replacement. Mr. Musk has not yet done so.
Mr. Musk has also escalated his long-running feud with mainstream media. Last Saturday, he revoked The New York Times's verification check mark, which had distinguished its Twitter account from impersonators. Mr. Musk had said Twitter would start removing verification badges starting on April 1, but most verified accounts have kept their check marks.
On Wednesday, Twitter added a label to the Twitter account of NPR, calling it "state-sponsored media." The label, which the platform used in the past to identify propaganda outlets, sparked backlash from press freedom organizations. In emails to an NPR reporter on Wednesday, Mr. Musk acknowledged that the label "might not be accurate" and added, "We should fix it."
This week, Mr. Musk has made a number of unexplained changes to Twitter, replacing the company's bird logo for a few days with the image of a Shiba Inu dog that's associated with the cryptocurrency Dogecoin.
On Tuesday, the company also covered the letter "w" in the name "Twitter" on a large public sign outside its San Francisco headquarters, in what some observers assumed was a vulgar joke.

Fasten Your Seatbelts: What to Bear in Mind About Bumpy Flights: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Recent incidents with turbulence during air travel raise questions about this challenging weather phenomenon. Here's what we know about it and how to stay safe.
Countless travelers have experienced the distinct anxiety-inducing sensation of turbulence on flights: Eyes squeezed shut, hands clamped to the armrests for dear life, bracing for the roller coaster to come.
Recent incidents have left dozens of passengers with injuries. Last month, seven passengers on a Lufthansa flight from Texas to Frankfurt were hospitalized with minor injuries after their plane encountered severe turbulence as it flew over Tennessee. And in December, about two dozen people, including an infant, were hurt on a Hawaiian Airlines flight from Phoenix to Honolulu that hit rough air shortly before landing.
The recent reports raise questions about whether turbulence is getting more frequent and intense.
We spoke to a handful of experts to learn more about the tricky-to-predict weather phenomenon. Here's what they said.
What is turbulence?
Turbulence is unstable air movement that is caused by changes in wind speed and direction, such as jet streams, thunderstorms, and cold or warm weather fronts. It can range in severity, causing minor to dramatic changes in altitude and air speed.
It's not just associated with inclement weather, but can also occur when skies appear placid. And it can be invisible both to the eye and weather radar.
There are four classifications for turbulence: light, moderate, severe and extreme. In cases of extreme turbulence, pilots can lose control of the airplane and there can even be structural damage to the aircraft, according to the National Weather Service.
Is turbulence increasing? And if so, why?
Recent research indicates that turbulence is rising and that this change is sparked by climate change, specifically elevated carbon dioxide emissions affecting air currents.
Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in England, has studied turbulence for more than a decade.
Dr. Williams's research has found that clear air turbulence, which occurs most frequently at high altitudes and in winter, could triple by the end of the century. He said that this type of turbulence, of all categories, is increasing around the world at all flight altitudes.
His research suggests that we could encounter bumpier flights in the coming years, which could potentially result in more passenger and crew injuries.
How is turbulence monitored and measured?
Meteorologists rely on a variety of different algorithms, satellites and radar systems to produce detailed aviation forecasts for conditions such as cold air, wind speed, thunderstorms and turbulence. They flag where and when turbulence might happen.
Jennifer Stroozas, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Aviation Weather Center, called turbulence "definitely one of the more challenging things to predict."
Using these forecasts, in addition to guidance from air traffic controllers, pilots attempt to skirt turbulent areas by adjusting their altitude to find the smoothest ride. This means flying higher or lower than the altitude where forecasters predict turbulence, and potentially burning more fuel than initially anticipated, an endeavor that can be costly.
Robert Sumwalt, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board who now heads a new aviation safety center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, stressed that it was impossible to prevent or predict all turbulence.
"There is always the possibility of unexpected rough air," Mr. Sumwalt said. "Generally it's not going to hurt you and not going to pull the wings off the airplane."
Turbulence also presents a greater threat to small planes that are more susceptible to changes in wind speed, rather than larger commercial airliners, Ms. Stroozas of the National Weather Service said.
Is it that dangerous? How can I stay safe during turbulence?
Airplanes are designed to withstand rough conditions and it is rare for aircraft to incur structural damage because of turbulence.
But turbulence can toss passengers and crew members around, potentially causing grave injuries. Multiple experts emphasized that staying seated and keeping your seatbelt on as much as possible during flights were the best ways to reduce risks.
"If you stay fastened you're far less likely to incur an injury," said Thomas Guinn, a professor of applied aviation sciences at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
In severe turbulence, the vertical motion of the plane will exceed gravity's pull, Dr. Williams said.
"What that means is that if you're not seat belted, by definition, you'll become a projectile, you're a catapult, you will lift up out of your seat," he said.
Fatalities caused by turbulence, while exceedingly uncommon, do happen. The last time a passenger on a commercial flight died from a turbulence-related injury was in 1997, when a United Airlines flight from Tokyo to Honolulu experienced severe turbulence over the Pacific Ocean, according to an N.T.S.B. investigation. This passenger was not wearing a seatbelt and flew up from her seat, possibly striking her head on the luggage bin, according to the investigation.
Last month, a former White House aide aboard a business jet traveling from New Hampshire to Virginia died from fatal injuries initially attributed to severe turbulence. However, a preliminary N.T.S.B. investigation found that the airplane's pilots turned off a switch stabilizing the aircraft, causing it to briefly oscillate in the air.
What about babies on laps?
Children younger than 2 years old are allowed to be carried on an adult's lap during flights, but many industry experts, citing dangers such as turbulence, believe this practice should be prohibited.
Last month, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, a union representing about 50,000 flight attendants across 19 airlines, renewed its decades-long push for every passenger to have their own seat, no matter their age.
Sara Nelson, the union's president, said in an interview that with turbulence becoming "much more common" lately, the need for young children to be properly secured in child safety seats during flights is a greater priority.
"We are talking about events in the cabin that are potentially deadly but survivable when you do the right things to protect yourself," Ms. Nelson said.
Unexpected turbulence is the leading cause of pediatric injuries on airplanes, according to the F.A.A., which has detailed information about various child restraint systems and how to correctly install them onto airplane seats. Some of these products are compatible for both cars and airplanes.
For decades, the F.A.A. and N.T.S.B. have urged parents to secure young children in their own ticketed seats and in an approved safety seat. The American Academy of Pediatrics also echoes this guidance. There is no federal law requiring these measures.

Hoping to Travel Abroad? Passport Applications Face a Processing Backlog.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Processing times for new and renewed passports have increased again. The updated timeline, 10 to 13 weeks, leaves some would-be travelers feeling desperate.
With international travel beckoning this summer, Americans applying for new or renewed passports will have to practice patience: The State Department warned that it will take even longer to get their documents.
As of March 24, routine processing of passports will take 10 to 13 weeks, and expedited processing, which costs an extra $ 60, will take seven to nine weeks. That's a two-week increase from the previous timeline.
Applicants have been frustrated for years over the passport application system. Staffing shortages during the pandemic continue to cause both extensive delays and a scarcity of in-person appointments.
Lawmakers have vowed to solve the backlog, and the State Department piloted an online renewal system that was briefly offered to the public before being paused. But with a surge of applications and an especially busy summer travel season ahead, any significant easing of the jams may be a distant reality.
Why is it taking so long to get a passport?
The current delays were set off at the beginning of the pandemic, when demand for travel documents dropped and employees were let go or reassigned to other tasks, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a recent budget hearing.
"Emerging from Covid, we had to build back. And we have been in an intense effort to do that," he said, adding that demand for travel has surged. In the 2022 fiscal year, the department issued nearly 22 million passports, the highest on record. The number in 2023 is expected to increase.
The department receives about 500,000 passport applications each week, about 30 percent more than during the same time last year.
"In 40 years, I can honestly tell you I've never seen it this bad," said David Alwadish, the founder of itseasy.com, a passport and visa expediting service. The bulk of Mr. Alwadish's clients have already paid for expedited processing, he said, and many are desperate to secure a passport in time for a trip.
Travelers who need documents within 14 days can call to book an in-person appointment at a passport center. But callers who are hoping to secure an appointment or get updates on their submitted application have reported long hold times. Multiple attempts in late March to call the number listed on the State Department's website were met with a busy tone. A spokesman for the department said they were increasing the number of lines and staff to handle the influx of calls.
What's being done to speed things up?
Mr. Blinken said that a task force has been established to speed up processing times. And hundreds of additional staff are in the hiring pipeline, according to a State Department spokeswoman. Existing staff are already working overtime, and others have been enlisted from across the department to help with the demand.
The budget for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which provides passport services to U.S. citizens, has also been increased by nearly $ 211 million. The increase has funded contract labor, higher postage costs and new initiatives like online passport renewal, which the government began testing last year to make it more convenient for existing passport holders to renew their documents.
What happened to the online renewal program?
More than 500,000 people successfully applied online to renew their passports since the service was first offered to the public in August 2022. The government suspended online renewal on March 8, 2023, saying it would review customer feedback and make improvements.
Though some users reported positive experiences with the online system, others were frustrated. Mina Zimmerman, a Los Angeles resident, submitted an expedited application on Jan. 24 to renew her passport in time for her 15th wedding anniversary, which she planned to celebrate in Mexico on April 2 -- plenty of buffer time, she thought, for what the government said would be a three- to five-week wait.
But five weeks after her application was received, it still hadn't been processed. Despite repeated phone calls, Ms. Zimmerman was never able to get through. At times she even had trouble loading the website.
"It was a terrible experience, because you just had no help anywhere," she said, adding that, as the date of her trip approached, she began to panic.
Ultimately, Ms. Zimmerman found help on Reddit. Other passport applicants advised her to call a tech support line, where she found help. Her passport finally arrived more than seven weeks after she applied, and two weeks before her trip.
"They definitely made the right decision to shut it down for now," she said of the online renewal program, adding that she thought the website needed to be better equipped to handle the traffic and offer regular updates.
What if I need to travel this year?
The consensus from immigration experts and officials is to check your passport expiration date before making international plans -- and to renew it as early as possible, if necessary.
With the online process suspended, applicants can still renew by mail or make appointments at passport acceptance facilities, which can include post offices, libraries and local government offices. Appointments are limited, however and some applicants have reported traveling beyond their local office to snag one. Fuji Whittenburg, the chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association State Department Liaison Committee, recommends taking care to ensure the forms are completely filled out and that the correct fees are included with a money order or check.
If possible, she said, opt for expedited passport processing ( $ 160 for a renewal for an adult, plus the $ 60 fee for expediting) and expedited postage ( $ 19.53) to mail your old passport and return the new passport. The entire process should take between seven and nine weeks, with a day or two on either end for shipping.
If you need to travel imminently, within 14 days, you can try to book an in-person appointment at a passport agency. If all else fails, both Ms. Whittenburg and Mr. Alwadish suggest reaching out to your congressperson or your senator with your passenger record locator.
If you want to avoid the ordeal a little longer? Travel within America, Mr. Alwadish said.

Introduce Your Teens to the City and Its Restaurants: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: See the sights, eat well and instill a love of this city.
A question that often appears in the Where to Eat inbox is, "Where should I take my teenager to eat when we visit New York City?" I love this question for two reasons: First, there's the "broadening horizons" of it all -- how else to create a potential future New Yorker? -- and second, it reminds me of my own formative trips to the city.
What follows is a nonexhaustive mixture of classic and not-so-classic recommendations, all conveniently located near tourist sites, that should be as appealing to you as to your Gen Z-er. I can't make your teens appreciate you, but I can make sure they'll be full enough to fall asleep on your shoulder on the ride back to the hotel.
Midtown Manhattan Eating and Jewish Deli Noshing
Let me be the first to tell you that Top of the Rock is the superior choice as far as tourist sites go, mostly because it has one of the best views of Central Park you can get without spending millions on real estate. And then you can take your bright-eyed teenager to either the food court under Rockefeller Center (check out the Pan-African rice bowl restaurant Fieldtrip) or Urban Hawker, a Singaporean food hall on West 50th Street. There, rejoice in the oyster omelets at Prawnaholic Collections, the rich and pungent shrimp fried rice at Mr. Fried Rice and the desserts from Lady Wong, one of the city's most exciting new bakeries.
Now, for your visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, don't try to do it all: Go to the Temple of Dendur, check out the Impressionist galleries and finish with the Costume Institute. Once you've gotten all those steps in, it's time for pastrami. I'm all about Katz's, on the Lower East Side, which should be your first choice. But if time is tight, you can't beat Pastrami Queen, a Met-adjacent, Upper East Side kosher deli institution. This is where you can revel in the wonders of pastrami on rye, latkes and matzo ball soup.
Chinatown Classics, People-Watching Pizza and a Brooklyn Hop
First up, proper Cantonese food. Old Chinatown and new New York seem to agree on Wu's Wonton King, a seven-year-old B.Y.O.B. restaurant on East Broadway where "whole ducks and suckling pigs gleaming from hooks" hang in the windows, as Ligaya Mishan wrote in her review for The Times in 2017. The storm-bringer is the deep-fried Dungeness crab, but the wontons in pork broth are just as occasion-worthy, as is the garlic crispy chicken. Come hungry.
Now you can start shopping on Broadway, in SoHo. (The new Glossier store is at Spring and Crosby, and the Nike store is one block away; get all your school-supply and basic-clothing needs met at Muji and Uniqlo; and thank me later!) Then pizza. Teens will love Upside Pizza, in NoLIta. The food and the people-watching are top-tier, and you can end with soft serve from Softside, next door. I prefer the thick Sicilian pepperoni slice, heartburn be damned.
And do visit Brooklyn. I and more than two million of my friends live here, and the view from Brooklyn Bridge Park will solidify a future love of New York City. That and a meal at Al Badawi, a Palestinian restaurant on Atlantic Avenue that's overflowing with all the warmth and hospitality New York isn't known for, but actually has in spades. Drag warm pita through more than a dozen mezzes, cut into the lamb shanks over rice and fight over the last slice of the pistachio flatbread -- though when it comes to competitive eating with teenagers, you'll always lose.
In Other News ...
Openings: Carriage House, a new celebrity-backed restaurant with butter candles, is now open in the West Village; the hotly anticipated Superiority Burger is taking diners; and ALF Bakery, from the pastry chef and chocolatier Amadou Ly, opens at Chelsea Market on Friday.
Gen Z-ers love cheese and yogurt as much as previous generations, but they can't seem to come around on milk. Kim Severson reported on the dairy industry's fight to change that.
The lesbian bar is alive and well at two new spots in Los Angeles, writes Tejal Rao: the Ruby Fruit, a natural wine bar in a Sunset Boulevard strip mall, and Honey's at Star Love.
With 20 seasons and nearly 300 episodes, "Hot Ones," the web series featuring celebrities eating progressively spicier wings, remains a winning formula, writes Maya Salam.

Regulation; TikTok Is Penalized In Britain for Data Misuse: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The video-sharing app inappropriately allowed access by more than one million underage children in the United Kingdom in 2020, regulators said.
Britain's data protection authority on Tuesday issued a $ 15.9 million fine to TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, saying the platform had failed to abide by data protection rules intended to safeguard children online.
The Information Commissioner's Office said TikTok had inappropriately allowed up to 1.4 million children under the age of 13 to use the service in 2020, violating British data protection rules that require parental consent for organizations to use children's personal information. TikTok failed to obtain that consent, regulators said, even though it should have been aware that younger children were using the service.
The British investigation found that the video-sharing app did not do enough to identify underage users or remove them from the platform, even though TikTok had rules barring children under 13 from creating accounts. TikTok failed to take adequate action, regulators said, even after some senior employees at the video-sharing platform raised concerns internally about underage children using the app.
TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, has also faced scrutiny in the United States. Last month, members of Congress questioned its chief executive, Shou Chew, about possible national security risks posed by the platform.
The TikTok privacy fine underscores mounting public concerns about the mental health and safety risks that popular social networks may pose for some children and adolescents. Last year, researchers reported that TikTok began recommending content tied to eating disorders and self-harm to 13-year-old users within 30 minutes of their joining the platform.
In a statement, John Edwards, Britain's information commissioner, said TikTok's practices could have put children at risk.
"An estimated one million under 13s were inappropriately granted access to the platform, with TikTok collecting and using their personal data," Mr. Edwards said in the statement. "That means that their data may have been used to track them and profile them, potentially delivering harmful, inappropriate content at their very next scroll."
In a statement, TikTok said it disagreed with the regulators' findings and was reviewing the case and considering next steps.
"TikTok is a platform for users aged 13 and over," the company said in the statement. "We invest heavily to help keep under 13s off the platform, and our 40,000-strong safety team works around the clock to help keep the platform safe for our community."
This is not the first time that regulators have cited the popular video-sharing app over children's privacy concerns. In 2019, Musical.ly, the operator of the platform now known as TikTok, agreed to pay $ 5.7 million to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that it had violated children's online privacy protection rules in the United States.
Since then, legislators in the United States and Europe have put in place new rules to try to bolster protections for children online.
In March, Utah passed a sweeping law that would prohibit social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram from allowing minors in the state to have accounts without parental consent. Last fall, California passed a law that would require many social media, video game and other apps to turn on the highest privacy settings -- and turn off potentially risky features like friend-finders that allow adult strangers to contact children -- by default for minors.

Teaching Conservative Principles on Campus: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
In "Liberal Professors Can Help Rescue the Republican Party," by Jon A. Shields (Opinion guest essay, March 24), Mr. Shields proposes an idealistic program of inoculating politically conservative students against MAGA-style Trumpism through university courses in the best and most thoughtful traditions of conservatism.
However, modern "conservative" students drawn to MAGA aren't interested in the ideas of Edmund Burke, Adam Smith and David Hume. Nor are "liberal" students who scream at conservative legal scholars interested in the policies of Franklin Roosevelt or the ideas of Michael Harrington and Michael Walzer.
The problem is not that either group has been poorly educated. It is that both groups have been all too well educated by social media algorithms.
Jesse Larner
New York
To the Editor:
Prof. Jon A. Shields's overly sunny view of conservatism leaves much to be desired. He ignores the fact that throughout the history of the United States -- well, the world, actually, but let's keep it local -- most conservatives have been on the wrong side of every single significant social or political issue. In fact, if conservatives had their way, there wouldn't be a United States: The Tories did not want to separate from England.
Conservatives opposed abolishing slavery; they opposed child labor laws, women's suffrage, Social Security, Medicare, gay marriage and working to stop climate change -- among other issues. Throughout history, liberals -- usually labeled radicals or socialists or another name meant to alienate them from the majority -- have proposed ways to improve society for all, and conservatives have strongly opposed them. Then the majority of the population agreed with the liberals and eventually most conservatives changed their minds and also agreed.
Often this agreement has to do with people coming to understand the issues and the ethics involved in making society more equitable. The more one knows about politics and society, the more one will reject conservatism, which is why, as Professor Shields notes, most college professors are not Republicans.
Michael Spielman
Bronx
To the Editor:
What about directing all students away from the crazies and toward solid writings about conservative principles?
I am a conservative down in Texas. I read The Times to listen to and understand liberal viewpoints with which I often do not agree (and because y'all are the best war correspondents), but I recognize that liberals and conservatives need each other to check each other's excesses.
We should always try to do better but we should not always presume we know better. America needs good Democrats and Republicans to accomplish this. Neither are evil. Each brings something to the table with enough humility to know that the other does, too.
Brian Corrigan
Richardson, Texas
To the Editor:
The unusually thoughtful essay by Jon A. Shields is a welcome antidote to the shrillness of so much discourse in today's media. Its appeal for college courses that challenge conventional "liberal" thinking is sound and urgent. It is a model of the sort of conservative opinion pieces I would like to see more frequently in The Times.
Charles Michener
Palm Beach, Fla.
To the Editor:
As a lifelong conservative, I am sad to watch the G.O.P. devolve into a populist party and forget the ideals that drove us. I look forward to checking out some of the books Jon Shields recommends.
As a high school math teacher, I have a lot on my plate sponsoring our math club and coaching STEM events, but this makes me wonder about sponsoring a high school conservative club and sharing these resources.

Russia's Abduction of Ukrainian Children
To the Editor:
Re "Russia Signals Intention to Deport More Children" (news article, March 19):
Many of the teens and toddlers abducted by Russia from Ukraine have been taken from orphanages, but are not orphans at all. They have parents and extended families.
Most end up in these custodial settings because families lack the support to take care of a child born with a disability. Or, mired in poverty, they wish for a better life for them in an orphanage.
Sadly, children across the world -- an estimated eight million living in institutions -- are also in grave danger of being illegally adopted or trafficked for pornography, organs and labor. And those with disabilities in these facilities are often left to die -- lonely and painful deaths.
These nefarious horrors are only exacerbated during times of conflict.
All children need the love and protection of a family. And most families would keep their children if they could.
As Russia continues to kidnap children from Ukrainian orphanages, governments, donors and international aid agencies should shift funds to support families.

Have Hard Conversations With Your Teens
To the Editor:
Re "12 Teens and Tweens on America Today" ("America in Focus" series, Sunday Opinion, March 26):
The youth mental health crisis is an urgent, multifaceted issue that requires creative solutions, such as interactive conversations like this one, which give adults a glimpse into the lives of teens today.
In February, the C.D.C. released a report showing, among other concerning statistics, that nearly one in three teen girls in the U.S. seriously considered attempting suicide in 2021, an almost 60 percent increase from 2011. All groups of teens who participated in the study reported increased mental health challenges, and more than one in five nonheterosexual teens attempted suicide in the past year.
The 12 kids who participated in this conversation demonstrate how often teen despair can be fueled by factors that can also have a positive impact on kids' lives, such as phones, remote learning and an understanding of the news cycle. This creates a host of difficult decisions for parents and teens alike.
I therefore encourage parents to have similar exploratory conversations with their children. When it comes to school shootings and other distressing subjects, children can often sense fear from adults around them, and avoiding the topic only makes it more frightening.
All around us, our children are seeking solutions and asking for help. It's up to us to not only listen, but also to initiate conversations around these topics.

Scams Against Artists
To the Editor:
Re "Fake Buyers Are Phishing in Art World" (Arts, March 20):
Preying on the vulnerabilities of artists is a heartless occupation. As a working artist, I have had an untold share of phishing emails and more recently phishing DMs through my Instagram account. Your article was an excellent forensic examination of a typical scam.
This type of phishing can take a psychic toll, and it also requires artists to spend valuable time (when they could be creating) trying to determine whether or not an inquiry is legitimate or fake. It's exhausting!
I often think that if the time and energy scammers devote to their trade were applied to something legitimate, they might be successful entrepreneurs.

Atop Her List, Taking the Hat for a Walk: [Metropolitan]

Full text: Linda Pagan, who runs a popular hat shop in SoHo, likes to stroll and visit neighborhood spots like Fanelli Cafe and Film Forum.
"The right hat is an expression of your personality," said Linda Pagan, who owns The Hat Shop NYC. "You are never alone when you wear a hat -- wearing one is like walking a dog but without all the work; people will always stop and talk to you."
Ms. Pagan should know. Her boutique has been a SoHo mainstay for nearly three decades. Customers have included Yoko Ono, Bette Midler, Gary Oldman, Sean Combs and Tamron Hall.
Ms. Pagan has a personal collection of 60 hats that she stores in the basement of her shop. "I always wear a hat as they make me feel great, and it's great for business. They are my business card," she said. "Thank goodness I didn't go into lingerie."
The only thing Ms. Pagan, 64, who was born in England, likes more than hats is her short commute. She lives in a one-bedroom apartment two blocks away from her store. She described it as her "cottage in the city."
SANCTUARY I have a strong circadian rhythm, so the time I wake up depends on the season: 5 a.m. at the height of summer and 7:30 a.m. in the dead of winter. I turn on WQXR and make what is the first of three pots of PG Tips tea that I sip while in bed, which is my sanctuary. It's a captain's bed that was built by my father, who was a naval architect.
MIND/BONE HOUSE I start the Sunday Times with my favorite sections -- I finish the rest during the week -- and I check the news and headlines on my phone. After puttering around a bit, I do three rounds of Surya Namaskar yoga to wake up the "old bone house," which is an Elizabethan term for the body. I get dressed in my outfit of the day, put on my hat and head out for a walk.
SHOP HOURS Most Sundays, I'm in my shop from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. I don't eat breakfast, and I often grab a bite, usually a tuna fish sandwich, at Three of Cups, the bistro next door.
WALKING AND TALKING I love to walk around the neighborhood because even if I've not made any specific plans, I generally will run into someone on the sidewalk, and we'll have an impromptu conversation. We may later go to Il Corallo Trattoria or Local for a quick drink.
DAY OFF When the weather is warmer and I'm not working, I often catch the Rockaway ferry from Pier 11 on Wall Street to blow away all the week's cobwebs. I eat a late lunch at the Rockaway Hotel. I'm a member of several museums, so shows can be a big part of my day. The Whitney's "No existe un mundo poshuracán: Puerto Rican Art in the Wake of Hurricane Maria" was powerful.
CINEPHILE I go to a lot of films. I recently saw "Living" and "Tár," which I was prepared to hate but loved, at the Angelika. Film Forum is one of my favorite places, and I recently went there to see Peter Greenaway's "The Draughtsman's Contract," which celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. I like the Forum because of the aesthetics, the small size and the commitment of the audience to the films. And the desserts. The carrot cake from Betty Bakery in Brooklyn is phenomenal. If they have run out of it, it's a disaster. I always bring my own metal fork so I don't have to use a plastic one.
BAR PERCH For dinner, I generally go to Fanelli Cafe or Arturo's. I like to have dinner by myself, and I like to sit at the bar and eat. This gives me a chance to read some more of The New York Times and meet other people. I recently had a conversation about fencing, a sport I pursued in high school, with a young couple.
OVERHEARD The most extraordinary thing happened at Fanelli. There was a party of three sitting near me, and I heard an older woman say that she chose this restaurant because a friend of hers whose daughter has a hat shop in SoHo suggested it. I turned around and said, "That's my dad." As if that were not coincidence enough, it turned out that one of the men with her was her son, and we had gone to college together.
LOOK FOR THE MOON Once I get home for the night, I stream TV shows and films. "Ted Lasso," "The White Lotus" and "Slow Horses" are among my more recent favorites. Before I go to sleep around 11 p.m., I listen to WQXR and read either The New Yorker or a book for about a half an hour. I've been in a book club with the same people for 30 years, and now we're reading "The Magician" by Colm Tóibín. If the moon is out, I wait to see it. I love the idea that I'm in an urban setting and it still shines in my window.

Navigating Blue Check Apocalypse On Twitter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk, Twitter's owner, is changing the platform's longstanding practice of verifying accounts. That has implications for a range of users.
The blue check mark on Twitter has long conferred a special status. Only certain accounts -- typically those of public figures whose identities were confirmed -- have been bestowed the symbol.
Now that is changing.
Starting on Saturday, many Twitter accounts will lose the check mark under modifications being made by Elon Musk, the social media company's owner. Individual users must buy a subscription to Twitter's Blue service, which costs $ 8 a month, to obtain the badge. Businesses that are currently unverified will have to pay $ 1,000 a month if they want a gold check mark verifying their account.
The move, which will help Twitter generate revenue by making certain features exclusive to subscribers, has implications for a range of users on the platform. Here's what to know.
What does the change mean for Twitter users?
For those of you who primarily use Twitter to follow celebrities and news sites, this policy change will affect what you see and read on the service.
You may see fewer tweets from accounts you care about in your timeline, for instance, because individuals who choose not to pay for Twitter Blue will become less visible on the site.
It may become harder for most users to discern real people from phony accounts. If check marks are removed from the accounts of celebrities who are unwilling to pay for Blue, for example, it could become difficult to distinguish their accounts from impersonators.
Mr. Musk has said only posts from paid accounts with blue checks will be visible in Twitter's "For You" tab, the default timeline of tweets that the platform shows you based on your interests. The only exception, he later said, will be posts from nonverified accounts that you already follow, which will continue showing up in your timeline.
All of this means it is likely to become tougher to discover posts from accounts without the blue check marks. For example, if you follow lots of news about sports and a nonverified account tweets some sports-related news, you won't see it in your timeline unless you already follow that account. In the past, you may have found that content purely because it went viral.
One caveat to these likely changes is that Mr. Musk is not known for always following through on his public intentions. So parts of the check-mark policy could change as Twitter rolls it out.
Will people start paying for the check marks?
That all depends on whether the account holder derives enough value from having a blue check mark to justify paying for it.
Celebrities and institutions might choose not to pay because they already have large numbers of followers who will continue to see their posts.
The New York Times, which has nearly 55 million followers on Twitter, said on Thursday that it would not pay for the verified badge for its institutional accounts, including @nytimes. The Times also told its journalists that it would not reimburse them for a Twitter Blue subscription, except in rare cases when it was necessary for reporting.
But other types of Twitter users may choose to pay for the check marks. Those include some small businesses that use Twitter to market their services and want their content to reach broader audiences. In this scenario, paying for verification will essentially be an advertising expense.
Twitter is set to make some exceptions regarding which companies get to retain their check marks without paying. In an internal document, the company said it would let the 10,000 most-followed organizations, and the top 500 advertisers, that have already been verified keep their status.
What's going to happen to Twitter?
Among social media companies such as Meta and Snap, Twitter is the smallest social network, and the company continues to shrink in size and relevance.
Mr. Musk has shed much of Twitter's staff, leaving the company with fewer than 2,000 employees, down from 7,500 when he took over in October. The site still has problems with bots posting spam and impostor accounts impersonating public figures. Security issues, glitches and bugs are piling up. And some influencers and journalists are migrating to other platforms, including Mastodon, LinkedIn and Instagram.

Ivanka Trump's Support Is Muted: [Live Blog Post]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her statement sharply contrasted with the rage-filled responses from her brothers.
Former President Donald J. Trump's adult sons on Thursday were quick to defend him against the charges, as yet unspecified, and to rage at the Manhattan district attorney who secured an indictment from a grand jury. But his elder daughter?
After hours of silence, Ivanka Trump -- who served in Mr. Trump's administration alongside her husband, Jared Kushner, and has frequently defended her father -- weighed in with a comparatively muted statement on Friday.
She posted a short message on Instagram, saying simply: "I love my father, and I love my country. Today, I am pained for both. I appreciate the voices across the political spectrum expressing support and concern."
Mr. Kushner, for his part, did not comment until a previously scheduled public appearance Friday morning. "As Americans, it's very troubling to me to see the leader of the opposition party be indicted," he said. "And I think that that shows obviously the fear that the Democrats have of Trump and the political strength that he has."
The statement from Ms. Trump was in sharp contrast with those of her brothers. Mr. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., responded to the news immediately on Thursday on his online show "Triggered," describing the grand jury's vote to indict his father after a monthslong process as "stuff that would make Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, it would make them blush."
His second son, Eric Trump, wrote on Twitter that the indictment was "third world prosecutorial misconduct" and "the opportunistic targeting of a political opponent in a campaign year." (Mr. Trump has announced his presidential campaign, but the election is not until next year.)
Hours later, on Sean Hannity's Fox News show, Eric Trump made no distinction between law enforcement and his father's political opponents, describing them as "evil" and "wicked." He denounced "the weaponization of politics and of the justice system" and said, "At some point the guy deserves a pass" -- in response to which Mr. Hannity complained that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, "got a pass."
During his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly said Mrs. Clinton should be prosecuted, and the chant "lock her up" became a staple at his rallies. He has also called for retribution against his political opponents if he is elected again in 2024. (A yearslong investigation of Mrs. Clinton's use of email found no systemic or deliberate mishandling of classified information.)
Mr. Trump's younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, had not said anything about the indictment as of late Friday morning. But, as she rarely speaks publicly, her silence was not unusual.

Teaching Conservative Principles on Campus: [Letter]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To the Editor:
In "Liberal Professors Can Help Rescue the Republican Party," by Jon A. Shields (Opinion guest essay, March 24), Mr. Shields proposes an idealistic program of inoculating politically conservative students against MAGA-style Trumpism through university courses in the best and most thoughtful traditions of conservatism.
However, modern "conservative" students drawn to MAGA aren't interested in the ideas of Edmund Burke, Adam Smith and David Hume. Nor are "liberal" students who scream at conservative legal scholars interested in the policies of Franklin Roosevelt or the ideas of Michael Harrington and Michael Walzer.
The problem is not that either group has been poorly educated. It is that both groups have been all too well educated by social media algorithms.
Jesse Larner
New York
To the Editor:
Prof. Jon A. Shields's overly sunny view of conservatism leaves much to be desired. He ignores the fact that throughout the history of the United States -- well, the world, actually, but let's keep it local -- most conservatives have been on the wrong side of every single significant social or political issue. In fact, if conservatives had their way, there wouldn't be a United States: The Tories did not want to separate from England.
Conservatives opposed abolishing slavery; they opposed child labor laws, women's suffrage, Social Security, Medicare, gay marriage and working to stop climate change -- among other issues. Throughout history, liberals -- usually labeled radicals or socialists or another name meant to alienate them from the majority -- have proposed ways to improve society for all, and conservatives have strongly opposed them. Then the majority of the population agreed with the liberals and eventually most conservatives changed their minds and also agreed.
Often this agreement has to do with people coming to understand the issues and the ethics involved in making society more equitable. The more one knows about politics and society, the more one will reject conservatism, which is why, as Professor Shields notes, most college professors are not Republicans.
Michael Spielman
Bronx
To the Editor:
What about directing all students away from the crazies and toward solid writings about conservative principles?
I am a conservative down in Texas. I read The Times to listen to and understand liberal viewpoints with which I often do not agree (and because y'all are the best war correspondents), but I recognize that liberals and conservatives need each other to check each other's excesses.
We should always try to do better but we should not always presume we know better. America needs good Democrats and Republicans to accomplish this. Neither are evil. Each brings something to the table with enough humility to know that the other does, too.
Brian Corrigan
Richardson, Texas
To the Editor:
The unusually thoughtful essay by Jon A. Shields is a welcome antidote to the shrillness of so much discourse in today's media. Its appeal for college courses that challenge conventional "liberal" thinking is sound and urgent. It is a model of the sort of conservative opinion pieces I would like to see more frequently in The Times.
Charles Michener
Palm Beach, Fla.
To the Editor:
As a lifelong conservative, I am sad to watch the G.O.P. devolve into a populist party and forget the ideals that drove us. I look forward to checking out some of the books Jon Shields recommends.
As a high school math teacher, I have a lot on my plate sponsoring our math club and coaching STEM events, but this makes me wonder about sponsoring a high school conservative club and sharing these resources.

Russia's Abduction of Ukrainian Children
To the Editor:
Re "Russia Signals Intention to Deport More Children" (news article, March 19):
Many of the teens and toddlers abducted by Russia from Ukraine have been taken from orphanages, but are not orphans at all. They have parents and extended families.
Most end up in these custodial settings because families lack the support to take care of a child born with a disability. Or, mired in poverty, they wish for a better life for them in an orphanage.
Sadly, children across the world -- an estimated eight million living in institutions -- are also in grave danger of being illegally adopted or trafficked for pornography, organs and labor. And those with disabilities in these facilities are often left to die -- lonely and painful deaths.
These nefarious horrors are only exacerbated during times of conflict.
All children need the love and protection of a family. And most families would keep their children if they could.
As Russia continues to kidnap children from Ukrainian orphanages, governments, donors and international aid agencies should shift funds to support families.

Have Hard Conversations With Your Teens
To the Editor:
Re "12 Teens and Tweens on America Today" ("America in Focus" series, Sunday Opinion, March 26):
The youth mental health crisis is an urgent, multifaceted issue that requires creative solutions, such as interactive conversations like this one, which give adults a glimpse into the lives of teens today.
In February, the C.D.C. released a report showing, among other concerning statistics, that nearly one in three teen girls in the U.S. seriously considered attempting suicide in 2021, an almost 60 percent increase from 2011. All groups of teens who participated in the study reported increased mental health challenges, and more than one in five nonheterosexual teens attempted suicide in the past year.
The 12 kids who participated in this conversation demonstrate how often teen despair can be fueled by factors that can also have a positive impact on kids' lives, such as phones, remote learning and an understanding of the news cycle. This creates a host of difficult decisions for parents and teens alike.
I therefore encourage parents to have similar exploratory conversations with their children. When it comes to school shootings and other distressing subjects, children can often sense fear from adults around them, and avoiding the topic only makes it more frightening.
All around us, our children are seeking solutions and asking for help. It's up to us to not only listen, but also to initiate conversations around these topics.

Scams Against Artists
To the Editor:
Re "Fake Buyers Are Phishing in Art World" (Arts, March 20):
Preying on the vulnerabilities of artists is a heartless occupation. As a working artist, I have had an untold share of phishing emails and more recently phishing DMs through my Instagram account. Your article was an excellent forensic examination of a typical scam.
This type of phishing can take a psychic toll, and it also requires artists to spend valuable time (when they could be creating) trying to determine whether or not an inquiry is legitimate or fake. It's exhausting!
I often think that if the time and energy scammers devote to their trade were applied to something legitimate, they might be successful entrepreneurs.

Full text: Tashnuva Anan Shishir, who became her country's first transgender news anchor in 2021, is performing in "Public Obscenities" at Soho Rep.
When Shayok Misha Chowdhury wrote the character of Shou for his new bilingual play, "Public Obscenities," about a couple who interviews queer locals in Kolkata, India, he was "super worried" about casting the role. The performer would not only need to be of the appropriate gender but also a Bangla speaker with the right "linguistic fluency" to capture the character, who speaks "exuberantly and forthrightly and confidently," he told me recently.
Shou identifies as kothi, an Indian gender that encompasses a breadth of expressions, Chowdhury said. So he reached out to a friend for advice: a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who is "very in the sort of Bangali queer and trans space." After the professor mentioned Tashnuva Anan Shishir, Chowdhury searched her name online, and several questions came into his head: Is she even in New York? Would she be interested in auditioning?
When he posted a casting call on Instagram, and Anan responded, a plan started to coalesce. She was in New York, performing in Queens, in "I Shakuntala," a play by Golam Sarwar Harun and Gargi Mukherjee, a married couple who would also go on to star in "Public Obscenities." Anan's role was small, but she "stole the show," Chowdhury said.
After she auditioned for his play, it was practically unanimous, he said: "We have found the person." While Shou doesn't appear until 50 minutes into "Public Obscenities" -- its run at Soho Rep (in a coproduction with the National Asian American Theater Company) has been extended through April 16 -- the character has been among its most memorable.
In March 2021, Anan made history as the first transgender news anchor in Bangladesh. For three minutes, on International Women's Day, she spoke on the air and was seen by millions of her compatriots. She went on to anchor occasionally for the network, Boishakhi TV, through November 2021.
In December of that year, she came to New York, her first time in the United States. Her trip was primarily to receive care related to what she calls her transformation. And while here, professional opportunities have arisen: Last year she became the first transgender model from Bangladesh to walk in New York Fashion Week.
Anan, 31, grew up in a conservative Muslim family and has had a grueling journey to this point. She has endured relentless harassment and survived suicide attempts; been shunned by family members, including her father; and lived penniless in a slum.
"I really wanted to be an actress," Anan, who performed in theater in South Asia and in a small Bangla film, "Kosai," told me recently in a video interview. "People shouldn't be considered by their gender. People should acknowledge their work. People should acknowledge their skill." Being a news anchor in Bangladesh was eye-opening, she said, but it couldn't quite open up the world for her like the United States could. "I was feeling that I have to swim. So I should swim in the ocean, not in a pond, not in a river. So if I can achieve, I can achieve. If not, then not."
Here are excerpts from our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity.
How has life in New York been for you?
It's a lot of adaptation. I'm born and raised in a village, not a city. The city is highly competitive, but I like this competition. Being an activist, this is a great eye-opening for me to learning, to adapting to each other, to teaching how is the activism going on. When I was in Bangladesh, I was working in a national level. Now I'm in New York, and I'm working globally. I'm contributing internationally. So this is a good opportunity for me.
You've shown remarkable perseverance. What gives you strength?
For myself, that I believe: Do your own job. Just do hard work. There is no shortcut in life. Just believe in yourself. And just, first, inspire yourself. I have competition only with myself, because I'm trying to do a little bit better than yesterday.
Why do you think Shou has been so memorable to audiences?
Shou is intelligent, Shou is extra-talented, an extrovert, and Shou knows actually about this scenario: the situation of queer people, queer activism, especially in Kolkata, Bangladesh, Pakistan. So Shou is charming everyone. Shou is connected with everyone.
Shou is very common character in South Asia because Shou is kind of a feminine guy, so Shou would like to wear femininity in her body or in their body. So this feminine guy represents South Asian queer community also.
How do you see yourself in this character and how are you different?
Tashnuva bold, Tashnuva sexy, Tashnuva brave, Tashnuva iconic -- and the brand I created, I had to pay a lot. I had to leave my family to prove my identity.
Shou is also powerful. Shou is also entertaining. Shou is also jolly. Shou is also friendly. Tashnuva is sometimes moody, because people can consider my self-esteem or people can consider my self-respect as an ego, but I had to maintain it. But Shou doesn't have that; Shou is more friendly.
When I get confirmation from my team, I was a little bit tense actually, because, see, I have long hair, and the show is going to put, like, a wig. Then I asked Misha, "Should I cut my hair? I can't!"
First time, when I watched myself with that wig, with proper costume, I was so low -- believe me, I was so low. I didn't feel well because still, then, I didn't believe Shou. So I was trying to just discover what was going on. Now, I literally fall in love with that wig. Yeah, this is me, this is Shou.
How has the reception been from South Asian audiences?
Oh my God, they appreciate a lot. They were looking at their sorrows in front of them. They're looking at their life in front of them, through Shou's eyes. I got lots of messages from my friends -- "Tashnuva, you're doing really well because this is not doing acting, this is very natural." I wanted to be a natural actor. I want to play a character that should be more natural, that should be believable. I really believe when I am doing something, people should believe.
Last night, when I'm coming toward audience, a girl literally was crying, and she was from Bangladesh, and she born and raised here. She only heard me by social media, and this is the first time we get connected in person. And she was telling me, "Tashnuva, this is the story that we know but we couldn't tell in front of people."
What's next for you?
I don't like to say my dream because people are always critics. So I love to keep my dream inside. I am looking for opportunities to act more. So I think now, just now, after this project, I want to jump into another project. There I can play a more powerful character. There I can say another story. I don't want to pursue any character that is very common.
When I think about performance -- light, camera, action -- I love Broadway performance. Today and tomorrow, is my dream that I will perform in Broadway, or I will perform in a Hollywood film. When I start working, I just forget my every pain. I just forget everything. And this is the performance that inspired me a lot, that did a lot for me.

Full text: Hannah Sellinger and Basil Azim met while working for a mentorship program in Texas. He then asked for a number he already had.
Hannah Shea Sellinger often got on the mic during pep rallies at Byron Nelson High School in Trophy Club, Texas, with a nod to the girls' varsity basketball team.
"She made varsity freshman year," said Basil Azim, part of the enthusiastic crowd, though he barely knew her.
They are both now 24, and he came to this country in 1999 from New Delhi when he was three months old.
They finally met officially in the summer of 2016, before senior year, at an orientation of local high school volunteers for PAL, or Peer Assistance and Leadership, a mentoring program for elementary school children.
"Hannah and I ended up next to each other in a game of musical chairs," said Mr. Azim, who messaged her that evening on Twitter, asking for their PALS coordinator's phone number, which (wink, wink) he already had.
Photos soon flew back and forth on Snapchat, usually of her after basketball practice and him after football or soccer practice.
"I wanted to be pretty chill," he said, and soon playfully asked her out using a string of a questions leading up to: "Do you like Chinese or Italian food?" She opted for Chinese food.
In early August, they had their first date at Pei Wei Asian Kitchen in Southlake, Texas, and then stopped for frozen yogurt nearby. She still teases him for not picking up the tab.
"I thought he was friend-zoning me," she said.
But her father knew best. When Mr. Azim picked her up for a movie a few days before school started, the couple said her father recently told them that he had turned to her mother and said "he's the one," and even bet a steak dinner on it with a neighbor.
On Sept. 17, three weeks into senior year, Mr. Azim showed up at her house for their date in a boxing outfit. As the theme song from "Rocky" played on his cellphone, he held up a sign.
It said: "Will you knock out homecoming with me?" He then changed into proper clothes.
That evening, after dinner at a hibachi restaurant, he also asked her to be his girlfriend, and they later hugged good night. She called him a few minutes later to say he left his red boxing belt at her house. After he returned, they had their first kiss in her front yard. (They still do something special on the 17th of every month).
At school they rooted for each other at sporting events and celebrated their prom and graduation together.
They sometimes set up a hammock big enough for two in the wooded area of Trophy Club Park, and discussed pursuing a long-distance relationship during college -- she at Furman University in South Carolina; he at the University of Texas at Dallas.

The day she left for summer basketball training at Furman, they each exchanged 30 handwritten letters, and read one a day.
"It was a new exciting, creative way to communicate," she said. They continued good, old-fashioned letter writing throughout college -- along with daily FaceTimes and virtual weekend dates streaming a Netflix show together on the now-defunct Rabbit app.
In 2018, he transferred to N.Y.U., and the next year, Ms. Sellinger, tired of basketball, transferred to Texas Christian University. Both graduated cum laude -- he with a degree in finance and information systems and she with a degree in finance and real estate.
Mr. Azim is now a project manager at Land Link Realty, his family's Dallas-based real estate development company.
Ms. Sellinger is based in Southlake as a fashion reseller, and goes by Styles With Shea on Instagram.
On July 17, 2022, while on his family trip to Vitznau, Switzerland, Mr. Azim, whisked her away for lunch, and got down on one knee by Lake Lucerne. Her parents then surprised her. During a more than four-hour train ride to Geneva the next day, the families began planning their American and Indian wedding events.
On March 7, Imam Golam Safi Khan officiated at a Nikah before 100 guests in the groom's parents' backyard in Westlake, Texas, with Indian pre-celebrations including dholkis and an ubtan.
Three days later, the couple exchanged pages of handwritten vows privately, followed by vows before 150 guests at a traditional American ceremony at the Adolphus hotel in Dallas. At their reception, a two-piano band sprinkled in a traditional Hindi song and a hora.
Two Indian celebrations followed at the Live by Loews Arlington hotel in Arlington, Texas -- a mehndi on Saturday, and a Sunday reception with about 400 guests, and a fireworks send-off.
Ms. Sellinger, who is taking the groom's name, said her father will be collecting on his steak dinner in the next few weeks.

Here to Help; How to Set Boundaries With a Difficult Family Member: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: It's tricky but doable, says Nedra Glover Tawwab, a therapist and best-selling author. Here are her strategies for getting started.
Nedra Glover Tawwab knows deep in her bones that you cannot choose the family you are raised in.
Ms. Tawwab, 39, grew up in a bustling home in Detroit where she "experienced it all," she said, "from substance abuse to neglect in family relationships." She scores a seven out of 10 on the Adverse Childhood Experiences Survey, a tool commonly used by health care providers to measure the severity of trauma that a child has faced.
That background led to her career as a licensed clinical social worker focusing on relationships. She is also a best-selling author of the book "Set Boundaries, Find Peace: A Guide to Reclaiming Yourself" and a popular Instagram therapist whose 1.7 million followers devour her pithy nuggets. (A recent example: "The silent treatment isn't teaching them a lesson; it's showing you can't handle conflict.")
In Ms. Tawwab's newest book, "Drama Free: A Guide to Managing Unhealthy Family Relationships," she offers practical strategies for dealing with toxic family dynamics -- and ways to successfully disconnect from a person when you decide to do so.
"As a child, relationships are put on you, but as an adult you get to choose who you want to be in relationships with and how," Ms. Tawwab said. "Even with family."
Setting and maintaining boundaries in relationships is difficult, enduring work, especially when it involves a parent, sibling, child or some other family member who has played a significant role in your life for as long as you can remember.
Ms. Tawwab shared some strategies to help start this emotional process.
Decide what a "successful" relationship would look like to you.
You'll never have a perfect relationship with anyone in your family, Ms. Tawwab said. With a difficult family member, it helps to step back and consider what a "successful" connection means to you.
To begin, identify the issues that are affecting your dynamic with this family member, she said. Then decide what type of relationship you can realistically have, and want to have, with that person, taking those dynamics into account.
For example, perhaps you are struggling in your relationship with your in-laws. "If you come from a close-knit family and your partner has a family that's a bit more distant, sometimes we try to arrange things, we try to invite them in, and when we get that pushback we're upset," Ms. Tawwab said. In that scenario, "success" may mean that you accept the way your in-laws are and stop trying to change the family culture, she said.
Ask yourself: What can I control?
Throughout her new book, Ms. Tawwab emphasizes her belief that you cannot change your family members.
"When the solution to the problem is 'they need to change,' the problem will never go away," she writes. "You can only control your side of the street."
Ms. Tawwab recommends asking yourself: If this person did not change a single thing, what -- if anything -- could I do to make the relationship different? Write it all down in a list, she said: "These are the issues in this relationship. These are the parts of those issues that I can change, and these are the parts that are not my stuff."
In the book, Ms. Tawwab offers the example of "Kelly" (she uses only first names throughout), who has been emotionally "burned" by her brother, time and again. Instead of dwelling on how much she would like to change his behavior, Kelly could jot down coping strategies within her control, like letting his calls go to voice mail so she can return them if and when she is ready, and letting him know that certain topics, like rants about siblings or parents, are off-limits.
Increase your tolerance for difficult conversations.
Changing a dysfunctional relationship will invariably require you to say hard things to a family member. But that is a skill that anyone can develop, Ms. Tawwab said.
Start with a pep talk. Remind yourself that being assertive about your needs and your boundaries is not rude, she said.
Then, when it's time to address your family member, keep your script simple, Ms. Tawwab said. People often put off difficult conversations because they are searching for the "right" words. It's OK to say something like "I don't want you yelling at me anymore," she offered as an example, adding, "There's not a more 'beautiful' or perfect way to say that." (Therapy can also help you identify and connect to your needs and learn to express them, she said.)
"We have tricked ourselves into thinking that we're supposed to always feel comfortable, so even as we're saying hard things our goal is to say it without the other person feeling upset or mad or wanting a further explanation," she said. "And that's not realistic."
Know that the family member will likely take it personally.
In dysfunctional families, change is almost always seen as a rejection, Ms. Tawwab said. She writes in her book that "boundaries in unhealthy families are a threat to the system of dysfunction."
Your call for change might be met with disapproval ("You're wrong for changing; everything was going well until you intervened"), shame ("You're a terrible person"), or resentment ("I'm upset because you want something different"), she writes. You could also encounter general pushback, which might involve your family member continuing to behave as though you said nothing or pressuring you to change your mind.
Anticipating those responses can help you steel yourself so you are not hurt by your family member's reaction.
Find a healthy distance.
Ms. Tawwab said she was struck by the number of people she encounters who overlook the strategic power of distance and its importance in preserving certain bonds while still establishing a healthier dynamic.
Distancing yourself from a family member is not the same as ignoring that person, she writes. Distancing might mean putting time and space between you and your relative (for example, declining invitations or staying in a hotel during family holidays). Distancing could also mean engaging less with the person on an emotional level (for example, steering the conversation away from topics you're not comfortable with or simply excluding that person from certain areas of your life).
If you want to maintain a relationship with a difficult family member because it ultimately feels worth it to you, acceptance -- and strategic distancing -- can give you some peace, Ms. Tawwab writes, but it won't be easy.
"You will have to do the work to accept situations, and build patience for what is outside your control," she writes. "Remember that dealing with certain problematic behaviors is a choice."

'Sorcery' in Mexico City: A Japanese Green Thumb's Purple Legacy: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Every spring, jacarandas bloom in Mexico City. The colorful purple flowers are a living legacy of a Japanese gardener.
The Mexican president wanted cherry trees.
It was 1930, and President Pascual Ortiz Rubio had seen them lining the streets of Washington and desired the same beautiful spectacle for his country's capital.
To try to fulfill the leader's request, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs tapped Tatsugoro Matsumoto, a Japanese immigrant who tended the gardens of Chapultepec, then the presidential residence in Mexico City. But winters in the capital were not cold enough for the cherries to fully blossom, the expert gardener said. The president wouldn't get his hanami, the flower-contemplation ritual the Japanese celebrate every spring.
At least not a pink one.
If cherries were not suitable for the Mexican capital, another tree with colorful flowers might do the trick: jacarandas.
Mr. Matsumoto had already advised another president to plant jacarandas in the city. But those were the post-revolutionary years when there were few government resources to spend on beautifying Mexico's capital, according to Sergio Hernández, a researcher at the National Institute of Anthropology and History.
History has blurred some details of the president's request and its execution, but today the jacarandas stand tall among the city's greenery, a lush canopy heralding spring's arrival.
For nearly 100 years, Mexico City residents have enjoyed jacaranda season: a "fascinating sorcery" that brings a little bit of the Amazon rainforest to urbanites' doorstep, as Alberto Ruy Sánchez wrote in his 2019 book "Dicen las Jacarandas." And when the flowers fall, "the sky blooms on the ground," an unexpected burst of color at one's feet.
Each spring, millions of people stroll around the country's capital under an explosion of purple flowers. Each spring, the colorful fronds signal that it's time to enjoy the warm season and walk on a fine rug of lavender petals. Come out and play, the jacarandas whisper with an inflection that's both foreign and familiar.
"I was told this tree always creates hope," said Alma Basilio, a psychologist posing for a selfie with a friend under the blossoms "The jacaranda is kindness."
Jacarandas are actually not native to Mexico: The name comes from Guaraní, an Indigenous language spoken mainly in Paraguay and the tree has its origin in the Amazon.
They are deciduous trees, meaning they lose their foliage every year when the weather turns cold enough. And when temperatures rise, their bare, tortuous branches fill with bunches of blooms.
"Boom! Immediately, not progressively, the whole tree is full of flowers," said José Luis López Robledo, an arborist who runs a nursery garden near Mexico City.
The flowers grow in bunches and bear an attractive purple-blue color because of anthocyanins, a pigment also found in dahlias, berries, black beans and sweet potatoes. In 2021, when most of the planet was focused on pandemic survival, jacaranda was named a trend color by a Mexican forecast company.
"The color jacaranda is an omen for a rebirth," the agency, Trendo.mx said, describing the hue as between amethyst and mauve, comparable to periwinkle.
The man responsible for the purple spring, Mr. Matsumoto, was one of the first Japanese immigrants to come to Latin America as a free man, at a time when most Asian immigrants in Latin America came either as indentured servants or with contracts to supply cheap labor to plantations, mines and railroads.
Mr. Matsumoto's Mexican immigration card says he arrived in 1896, and listed "gardener" as his occupation. But in Japan, he was in fact a trained landscape architect who had served the imperial palace, Mr. Hernández explained.
Mr. Matsumoto made his way to the Americas in 1888 at the behest of a Peruvian entrepreneur who wanted a Japanese garden, the first in South America, on his property.
"From his faraway native land, the artist brought by ship beautiful plants," reads a Peruvian volume about the residence where the garden was built. Shortly after seeing his work in Lima, a Mexican mining businessman hired him to create something for his hacienda.
Mr. Matsumoto would eventually become a wealthy entrepreneur who served several Mexican presidents: from the French-loving Porfirio Díaz to the revolutionary Álvaro Obregón and the nationalist Lázaro Cárdenas. With his flower shop, which he opened in 1898, Mr. Matsumoto introduced ornate floral arrangements to high society and created bouquets for stars of the golden era of Mexican film.
In recent years, Mr. Matsumoto's talents with flora have made him something of a local pop icon, a quiet hero. But Mr. Hernández, who has documented extensively Mr. Matsumoto's trajectory, points out he was much more than that.
He didn't introduce the jacarandas to Mexico -- some may have already been growing in the wild -- as much as domesticate them. He didn't just suggest a more appropriate tree for the weather in the Mexican capital: He outfitted its streets with an aesthetic vision that resurfaces every spring.
"Matsumoto was a merchant of landscapes," said Mr. Hernández.
In a city of old trees and crooked sidewalks, jacarandas are good tenants: Their roots tend to grow downward -- instead of to the sides -- and leave the urban infrastructure almost untouched. But because they grow tall (they can reach up to 80 feet), they can be a nemesis of electric wires and a target of the tree trimmers of the utility company.
In recent years, jacarandas have also drawn detractors: "Controversy Blooms Over Jacarandas," read an article this month that quoted specialists warning exotic species might create imbalance in the local ecosystems.
"They're too hyped," said Francisco Arjona, 34, an environmental engineer who leads tours of trees around Mexico City. He can list parks, intersections and parking spaces where one can admire the spectacle, but he also reminds visitors that they are also home to many other beautiful native trees.
By the 1940s, as the first generation of jacarandas were perhaps a bit over 30 feet high, Mr. Matsumoto and his son, Sanshiro, had become advocates for their community. When Mexico ordered all Japanese in the country to relocate to Mexico City and Guadalajara because of World War II, the Matsumotos interceded with the government and lodged 900 of their displaced compatriots in one of their many sprawling haciendas.
Jesús Roldán, 38, a mountain climber, was sitting below the crooked branches of a blooming jacaranda outside the Palace of Fine Arts, one of the most tagged trees on Instagram.
"They seem really complex to me, from their stature to their color, its arms and structure are very difficult to understand," he said. "I think they're not comfortable, perhaps they'd be better elsewhere."
Matsumoto Flowershop, on the northern edge of a trendy street in the Roma Norte neighborhood sits now mostly vacant, its expansive front outfitted with a handful of withering plastic flowers, an old sign and a lonely desk. Mexico City's urban landscape is continually changing: new buildings rise every day, hundreds of palm trees are dying to an unforgiving plague, water-conscious gardeners look for plants that will last through a drought. Winters are becoming shorter and hotter.
However, "if something will survive, it'll be the jacarandas," said Mr. López Robledo.

Ocasio-Cortez Posts Video On TikTok to Oppose Ban: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She joined left-leaning colleagues to oppose a ban on the Chinese-owned app, which critics in both parties have said threatens national security.
It was a bruising week for TikTok on Capitol Hill, but as momentum grew among Democrats and Republicans to ban the Chinese-owned video app over national security concerns, it gained an influential ally: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat of New York who is known for her own large social media following, waded into the debate just before midnight on Friday by posting a video on -- what else? -- TikTok. The video, her first on the platform, had garnered 1.5 million views by early Saturday morning.
In it, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez argues that President Biden and colleagues in both parties were "putting the cart before the horse" and rushing prematurely to cut off more than 150 million American users from the popular platform. She does not directly address their concerns that the Chinese authorities could exploit the app to monitor Americans or spread misinformation.
"If we want to make a decision as significant as banning TikTok, and we believe -- or someone believes -- that there is really important information that the public deserves to know about why such a decision would be justified, that information should be shared," she says in the video.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joins an exceedingly small group of lawmakers -- all of them progressive Democrats -- who have broken with their party to support TikTok. So far, the congressional defense of the platform has been led by one of her closest allies, Representative Jamaal Bowman, who represents an adjoining district around New York City.
The Biden administration and members of both parties in Congress have warned that Beijing could force TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, to hand over data on Americans who use the platform. Dozens of House Republicans and Democrats castigated the company's chief executive in a televised hearing this week, dismissing his claims that the company was independent.
Mr. Bowman, however, has said that the criticisms are a product of Washington groupthink. He has said that the Biden administration has yet to demonstrate that the Chinese authorities are manipulating the platform, warning of "xenophobic anti-China rhetoric."
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to an interview request about her position.
A spokeswoman, Lauren Hitt, said that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez created a TikTok account more than a year ago but had not posted on it until late Friday. She said that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not meet with prominent TikTok influencers or other representatives whom TikTok dispatched to Capitol Hill this week as part of a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign.
In the video, which was also posted to Instagram, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appears to share some of Mr. Bowman's concerns about a potentially drastic move absent any evidence of security risks. She says that members of Congress have not been briefed on any national security threat.
"Why would we be proposing a ban regarding such a significant issue without being clued in on this at all?" she asks in the video. "It just doesn't feel right to me."
The congresswoman also argues that rather than singling out one platform, Congress should create tougher, European-style policies to regulate how social media companies collect and manage data from their users.
While Mr. Bowman has said he believes that many of his colleagues' views are being warped by anti-China "hysteria," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not comment on the broader U.S.-China conflict or how the issues around TikTok fit into foreign policy.

Full text: The abbreviation, which stands for "commenting for better reach," has become a way for users on LinkedIn to support one another's job searches.
CFBR
/see-ef-bee-ahr/
An abbreviation for "commenting for better reach," so social media posts can be boosted by algorithms that favor content with high engagement.
Abbreviations like "LOL" and "ILY" are popular expressions used across the web, and these days chances are you have probably seen "CFBR," which stands for "commenting for better reach" and appears regularly under posts on LinkedIn.
People comment "CFBR" on others' posts to signal solidarity, and sometimes people ask commenters to write "CFBR" on their own posts to give them traction. The expression is becoming ubiquitous on LinkedIn as tech workers who have lost their jobs in recent months are turning to the platform to look for new opportunities.
A short comment from a stranger could mean hundreds more people see a post about layoffs, and come across a jobseeker's profile.
Last year, more than 161,000 people were laid off from technology companies and start-ups, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts. So far this year, more than 148,000 people have been laid off.
Over the past six months, as the tech sector has had its worst contraction since the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, the number of people who have turned on the "open to work" feature on LinkedIn has increased 20 percent, to 18 million, a spokeswoman for the company said.
Stephan Meier, a professor at Columbia Business School, called commenting on a layoff post "a completely altruistic act," especially if the commenter doesn't know the poster. The activity around layoffs shows how much people rely on LinkedIn -- and its algorithm -- to network, he said.
Late last year, when Amazon began to lay off what would become 18,000 employees, Heather Harris, 34, posted on LinkedIn about the cuts, asking people to "like, share, comment for better reach" on her posts.
Since then, strangers have tagged Ms. Harris, who works in human resources, in posts about job openings and sent her encouraging messages.
"I don't know if the 'CFBR' did it, but I kind of feel like it did," she said. "The more that people comment on your posts, the more it pops up on other people's feeds."
But Ms. Harris doesn't comment "CFBR" on other people's posts. She prefers the solidarity underpinning "CFBR" over the term itself. It can seem "spammy," she said, akin to "like for like" comments on Instagram.
"My personal preference is to comment something that is sincere and genuine and encouraging, rather than just 'CFBR,"' she said.
Ankit Singh, 30, writes "CFBR" only on posts about layoffs because he believes those posts need to be more visible on LinkedIn than other posts. He has noticed people commenting "reach+" -- with varying amounts of pluses -- on layoff posts, and said those comments also represented professionals looking out for one another.
"As a job seeker, I know how people feel," said Mr. Singh, who studies electrical engineering at New York University. "Even if I just click like or comment 'CFBR,' it's something to help them. If someone comments on my post, and a recruiter sees it, it could help me."

Should Helpers Suffer for an Artist's Sake?: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Tom Sachs made an art career on casual shock value and relationships with luxury brands. Now he's under attack for what employees say was an abusive studio environment.
Tom Sachs, the downtown artist who has recently come to broader public attention over accusations of epically mistreating his studio assistants, first emerged as a creature of interest to high-rolling, mid-cult New York in 1994, when he built a crèche for Barneys Christmas windows and cast Hello Kitty in the role of Jesus. Outraged, Catholic groups placed hundreds of calls to the store, and the display was quickly removed. Still, it was a time when a calculatedly offensive expression, a tasteless gesture, did not signal the midnight of a career so much as the bright early morning.
By the 1990s, New York was no longer the center of the art world, and the influence of critics was long past a period of decline. Gallerists and curators, whose affinities had once been so entwined with the preoccupations of totemic intellectuals, now found themselves increasingly under the spell of the fashion world's mercurial vision. The era of Clement Greenberg, who had famously championed abstract expressionism for its resistance to the invasions of commerce, was long over, succeeded by a new age that brought a rapturous enthusiasm specifically to these intrusions of the market.
In this environment Tom Sachs found a trend-chasing audience for his cheeky banalities -- sculptures of fast-food meals wrapped in Hermès packaging, a toilet made out of Prada shoe boxes, a homemade gun with a Tiffany logo. For a 2002 group show about art and Nazism at the Jewish Museum, Mr. Sachs built what he described as a "pop up" concentration camp forged out of a Prada hat box.
When the writer Deborah Solomon asked him in an interview in The New York Times Magazine what any of this could possibly have to do with Hitler, Mr. Sachs responded that fashion was like "fascism" because it was about the "loss of identity." Fashion, he went on, "is good when it helps you to look sexy, but it's bad when it makes you feel stupid or fat," suggesting that the coercions of Harper's Bazaar existed on some continuum with the Gestapo's.
The notion that Mr. Sachs was critiquing the vulgarities of luxury consumerism, however mindlessly, was just pretense -- his own and one passed along by an obsequious fashion press. But the joke was always on us. He was finding his way into the firmament, moving pop art away from its origins as a means of cultural comment toward a newer language of collusion, a descendant of Warhol's, if we imagined that Warhol held the ambition to actually work for the Campbell Soup Company. In 2006, Fondazione Prada, a gallery space in Milan, held a Tom Sachs exhibition. Six years later, in 2012, he began his ongoing collaboration with Nike to make sneakers, a relationship that now may be jeopardized.
A man's hypocrisy never drives in a single lane. The trouble for Mr. Sachs began earlier this month, when a Curbed investigation outlined allegations of misconduct by more than a dozen former employees (most who chose to remain anonymous either because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or feared retaliation). They all described a workplace characterized by fear and humiliation. For a while now, Sachs has made big art that requires many hands -- spaceship replicas and so on -- and his management style has made as much a fetish of process as the work itself does.
Thirteen years ago, he released a short film called "Ten Bullets" meant to serve as an employee guidebook instructing staff on his many exacting rules -- keeping fit, answering orders with the words "I understand" or "I don't understand" -- which has a satirical charm until you realize that the sentiment behind it all is largely serious. In the Curbed article, former workers alleged that Mr. Sachs made sexist comments about women's bodies, lost his temper, kept vintage porn on the walls, threw things, called people "autistic" or "retarded" and made assistants tend to demeaning personal errands.
A week or so later, more allegations surfaced in a piece in Artnet News, among them, from a former assistant who said she had to pick up clothes from Chanel for Mr. Sachs's wife, Sarah Hoover -- whose Instagram page is a showcase of her life in Chanel -- and prepare meals for her French bulldog consisting of wild rabbit, spinach, aloe water and coconut oil. In response to that assertion, a studio spokesman told Artnet that assistants were in fact dispatched to make Napoleon's "veterinarian-prescribed meals." Neither did the studio deny that Mr. Sachs had once appeared in a Zoom call with Nike in his underwear; it did clarify that changing clothes was a feature of "weekly virtual fittings."
In a public statement made after the accusations surfaced, Nike said that it was "deeply concerned by the very serious allegations" around Mr. Sachs and that the company was "in contact with Tom and his studio, seeking to better understand the situation and how these issues are being addressed."
On Tuesday, Mr. Sachs sought to confront what had happened, sending a letter to his staff. Although he said that he "never tried to make anyone uncomfortable," he acknowledged that he could be "impulsive" and "even aggressive," that he was "a demanding boss" who always expects "the absolute best," but that the "recent representations" of him in the media did "not portray the totality" of his long career.
Some allegations were false or misleading, he wrote, and while he did not follow that up with any detail about what exactly was false or misleading, he said that he sincerely regretted having referred to a particular room in the studio housing an air compressor as the "rape room." He was working to "improve" himself and he was in the midst of formalizing "Human Resource policies" -- ignoring, perhaps, that the ostentatiously regimented corporatization of the studio was what had caused so much of the conflict in the first place.
For all the recent show that the art and fashion worlds have made of their progressive politics -- their efforts to market their alignment with inclusive causes -- they remain tied to caricatures of intemperate genius -- even when the genius itself is hard to locate. A brilliant artist reads beneath the culture, identifying the undercurrents the rest of us cannot easily recognize. What should we make of one who has managed to miss what is happening right on top, who has been blind to a tidal wave of shifting social norms?
Stories like this typically prompt circular conversations about how we ought to think about the great art of bad men. Here, the question seems a lot simpler. Mr. Sachs ended the letter to his team by saying that he remained devoted to "innovation" and "radical ideas." Was he ever?

After Fleeing War for Paradise, They Wore Out Their Welcome: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After multiple accounts of tourists behaving badly, its governor wants Russia and Ukraine to lose access to Indonesia's visa-on-arrival program.
For most of last year, thousands of Russians and Ukrainians flocked to the Indonesian island of Bali to escape the war. There they found refuge in a tropical paradise where locals rolled out the welcome mat for Ukrainians fleeing the shelling and Russians dodging the draft.
Then, a Russian influencer scaled a 700-year-old sacred tree, naked.
After that, a Russian street artist painted an antiwar mural on a private house, and a Russian teenager was caught vandalizing a school.
A string of recent motorbike collisions involving Russians and Ukrainians has raised questions about traffic safety on the island.
Now, the once-welcoming Balinese people have had enough. Confronted with a barrage of complaints, the governor of Bali, Wayan Koster, announced earlier this month that he asked the Indonesian government to revoke Russia's and Ukraine's access to the country's visa-on-arrival program.
He said many of those who have flocked to Bali to avoid the war have not only violated a number of local laws but have been seeking jobs while on short-term tourist visas. (Obtaining a visa on arrival is usually instantaneous, requiring a $ 33 fee and no paperwork.)
The Balinese have long endured badly behaved tourists in mostly isolated incidents. Now, they complain regularly of half-naked foreigners riding motorbikes and desecrating objects that are considered sacred on the predominantly Hindu island.
"It's like they live in a bubble and they don't care about what's outside the bubble," said I Wayan Pardika, 33, a Balinese tour guide for a hotel. "For them, it is OK to be half naked, with only a bikini and driving around without a helmet. But they don't see that it's not so for the locals around them."
The Balinese were initially sympathetic to the plight of the new émigrés. Many extended credit for car and home rentals to Russians, who found themselves cut off from the international payments system because of sanctions. After being sealed off for two years during the coronavirus pandemic, they were eager for income.
But later, they discovered that many Russians had taken on jobs on the island -- as surfing instructors and tour guides. Some started their own car and home rental businesses, violating the laws governing tourist visas and taking away from local income.
"We opened our doors, we opened our arms, and we welcomed them with a big smile," said Niluh Djelantik, the founder of a luxury shoe brand in Bali. "But our kindness has been taken for granted."
Many Balinese say part of the issue is that the authorities are struggling to cope with the sudden influx of Russians, who now make up the second-biggest group of tourists on the island after Australians. Last year, 58,000 Russians and 7,000 Ukrainians visited Bali. This January alone, 22,500 Russians arrived in the province.
In May 2022, the Indonesian government added Russia and Ukraine to the list of countries eligible for its visa-on-arrival program. The visas allow Russians and Ukrainians and citizens from 85 other countries to stay for an initial period of 30 days, and for another 30 days if they apply for an extension.
Sandiaga Uno, the minister for tourism, indicated that the government was not going to revoke the visa program, as requested by the Bali governor. In a weekly address earlier this month, he said that the number of people causing trouble was "not too significant." Last November, Mr. Sandiaga had told The New York Times that the government would help renew the tourist visas of those fleeing the war.
But the authorities in Bali have zeroed in on the rising traffic violations involving Russians and Ukrainians that have sometimes turned deadly. In response, Mr. Wayan, the governor, announced last week a ban on all foreigners riding motorbikes, a decision that Mr. Sandiaga said should be reversed.
Grishanti Holon, 33, a Russian digital artist, said many of his compatriots who arrive in Bali come from small provinces without much exposure to the world. He said he has formed a group to teach Russians about Balinese norms and encouraged them to open businesses to create jobs for locals.
"Now there are too many people who come and they think: 'It's OK for me to do anything I want,"' Mr. Holon said.
Bali's tourism agency said it would put up signs in English, Russian and Ukrainian next week, urging tourists to follow "common-sense rules." "Do not post offensive, vulgar pictures to social media," read one poster. "Confine skimpy beachwear to appropriate venues." Offenders, it warned, would face "large fines and deportations."
Ukraine's ambassador to Indonesia, Vasyl Hamianin, told reporters last week that he was offended that Mr. Wayan had lumped Russians and Ukrainians together. Mr. Hamianin called on the governor to show him the crime statistics involving Ukrainians and cited Indonesian government data that showed that Russians were responsible for 56 traffic violations in Bali in the past week, dwarfing the five Ukrainian cases.
Mr. Hamianin said the 5,000 Ukrainians currently living in Bali contribute to the local economy and pay their taxes, and are "nice and obedient citizens." He said they were there because of the war but that "the absolute majority of them say they want to get back home."
"I think it's just human to allow the people who run from the war to stay some time in your country," Mr. Hamianin said.
Much of the frustration in Bali has been focused on Russian tourists. Ms. Niluh, the founder of the luxury shoe brand, has an Instagram account with 564,000 followers. Her account has become a clearinghouse for what she says are examples of Russians behaving badly in Bali. (On Monday, she posted two videos showing a Russian man baring his rear end on a sacred mountain and another purportedly Russian man picking a fight with a local security guard.)
On Thursday morning, Yuri Chilikin, the Russian tourist who bared his rear end, turned up at Ms. Niluh's house to apologize.
At Ms. Niluh's request, Mr. Chilikin, a 23-year-old from Moscow, agreed to perform a ceremony on the mountain to apologize. Ms. Niluh told Mr. Chilikin that if he abides by other laws, she would tell local officials not to deport him.
Still, Elena Pozdniakova, 33, an engineer from Moscow who arrived in Bali last September with her husband and their 3-year-old daughter, said the multiple accounts of Russian tourists behaving badly made her "feel ashamed."
"I just want to say that not every Russian is like this," she said.
Ms. Pozdniakova's husband, Sergei Pozdniakov, said he understood the frustration because he has also witnessed some of his countrymen behaving rudely. Despite the anger on social media, he and his wife say they remain touched by the hospitality of the Balinese people. "We've never met a Balinese person who has said, 'Because you are Russian, you are bad,"' said Mr. Pozdniakov.
In an interview, Silmy Karim, director general of immigration for the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, said he was still reviewing Mr. Wayan's proposal to revoke the visa-on-arrival program for Russia and Ukraine. He said his primary focus is weeding out foreigners who violate local law, and that he is studying the examples of other countries with large numbers of Russian tourists, including Thailand, where there are more than 350,000 Russians on the Thai island of Phuket alone.
"They can be orderly," he said. "It's up to us to watch over and discipline them."

TikTok Sets Time Limits. Teens Blow Past Them.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month, the company announced a new 60-minute "daily screen time limit" for users under 18. But for most young users, staying on the app takes just a few taps.
At the end of 2021, Ruby McMahon and some of her high school classmates decided to go "TikTok sober." Ms. McMahon had gotten hooked on TikTok during the Covid-19 pandemic and regularly spent five hours a day on the app.
"For a long time, I would do one assignment and then I would reward myself with a TikTok, but then that TikTok would turn into 30," said Ms. McMahon, a 17-year-old senior at East Lyme High School in Connecticut who has not returned to the app since she made the pact with her friends.
"It kind of affected my mental health," she added. "I was having a hard time sleeping when I was watching this many TikToks at night, but I couldn't go to sleep without watching my TikToks first."
TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is in Washington's cross hairs over concerns that it could be used to give Beijing access to U.S. users' data, such as their approximate location and browsing history. TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, is expected to get many questions about that on Thursday, when he testifies before Congress for the first time.
But Mr. Chew is also likely to come under fire from lawmakers about the app's effects on the well-being of young people. It is used by two-thirds of American teenagers, and some experts who study adolescent behavior online have said that TikTok appears to be promoting addictive content and recommending dangerous challenges and potentially toxic or harmful videos. TikTok says it has 150 million U.S. users; Sensor Tower, a market intelligence company, says users spend an average of 93 minutes a day on the app.
This month, the company announced a new 60-minute "daily screen time limit" for every account registered to a user under age 18. Mr. Chew hailed the new restriction in prepared remarks released on Tuesday ahead of his congressional testimony. He pointed to the limit as one of the "numerous steps to help ensure that teens under 18 have a safe and enjoyable experience on the app." Ahead of the hearing, TikTok has advertised its privacy and safety tools, with a focus on how it helps families manage their kids' TikTok accounts, in places such as Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Politico's Playbook newsletter.
But numerous teenage TikTok users, educators and youth experts expressed skepticism about the effort and its framing.
Under the new limits, which has not yet been released to all users, 13- to 17-year-olds on the app will simply be asked to enter their own passcode to keep watching videos after 60 minutes have passed. For users who say they are 12 or younger, parents can be in charge of their passcode and add 30 minutes of watch time at the 60-minute mark.
Joe Clement, a high school teacher in Fairfax County, Va., who is an author of a 2017 book, "Screen Schooled," about the overuse of technology in classrooms, said that "it's not really a limit, it's a suggestion." When he talked to his students about the prompts, they said that they would "blow right by that."
Daria, a 13-year-old in Manhattan, said that after long stretches on TikTok, the app would serve her videos asking her to, say, consider going for a walk. "I watch the videos sometimes because they're funny," she said, "but I think there are probably better ways that TikTok could be helping to limit time usage, like if they made videos more boring after an hour."
Brian Parker, a software engineer in Portland, Ore., has typically given his 14-year-old daughter three hours of TikTok screen time every day. (Apple and Google have tools for parents to limit screen time on their devices.) When he asked her if she came across any of the 60-minute prompts, she admitted that she was pretending that she was 21 on the app and so wouldn't receive those -- which was news to him.
"I think that's pretty common for all these kids; they've somehow learned through trial and error that they don't want to be their actual age because there will be limitations involved with that," Mr. Parker said.
Tracy Elizabeth, TikTok's head of family safety and developmental health, said that even though teenagers could still watch the app after entering a passcode, research showed that pausing to do that could cause them to do something else.
"That pause where they need to proactively think about what they're doing and make a choice if they'd like to continue using the app, that's the part that's really important," she said. TikTok doesn't yet have data on how the prompts are changing how teens use the app.
TikTok worked with the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital for advice and current research on screen time. The lab's funders include a mix of media, health care and technology companies, including TikTok and Meta.
Dr. Michael Rich, a pediatrician and director of the lab, acknowledged that TikTok's new rules weren't technically limits. "Really, what our input to them seems to have done is put some speed bumps in place," he said.
Some critics of TikTok have noted that the limits are much less strict than those built into Douyin, the Chinese version of the app. Douyin has a 40-minute time limit, after which it is inaccessible for its users under 14, and it can't be used overnight. TikTok has said the two apps are run by separate teams for separate markets.
Dr. Rich said that he was intrigued by Douyin's approach.
"One of the interesting debates going on among lawmakers is that China is well aware of the influence of the digital space on kids," he said, "and they are consciously trying to create a digital ecosystem that helps them be smarter and healthier and more in solidarity with each other."
Mr. Clement, the teacher in Virginia, said that he wanted to see a stronger response from TikTok.
"If this move by TikTok was sincere and they were really interested in helping kids, they would make the service unavailable during the school day -- especially for users under 18," he said. "There's absolutely no reason an under 18 kid needs TikTok during school."
Eve Slemp, a 17-year-old senior at East Lyme High School in Connecticut, is an avid TikTok user. She limits her time on the app to less than an hour per day during the week and two to three hours per day on weekends.
She recently discovered settings on the app that showed her that she was opening TikTok 90 times in a single day. She's on top of TikTok slang like "Am I the drama?" and watches #dayinmylife videos starring workers from Google and Instagram for career inspiration.
Lillie Pittman, a 16-year-old junior at Midlothian High School in Virginia, has been using TikTok since it was known as Musical.ly in 2018, spending two hours on the app every day. It's a core part of her social life and the culture at her high school.
"Me and my really, really close friends probably send over, I want to say, 50 to 60 TikToks per day and then altogether I probably get 100," she said.
Ms. Slemp, the senior in Connecticut, said TikTok "would get a lot of backlash" from teenagers if it set a real hard limit.
"They are for sure setting this time limit to make themselves seem like they care about teen mental health -- like, 'We're making an effort to prevent them from staying on too long,"' she said. "But they're smart; they know if they actually do that, they're not going to be as popular."

Organ Transplant System Is Facing Reform: [National Desk]

Full text: The Biden administration announced a plan to modernize how patients are matched to organs, seeking to shorten wait times, address racial inequities and reduce deaths.
WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it would seek to break up the network that has long run the nation's organ transplant system, as part of a broader modernization effort intended to shorten wait times, address racial inequities and reduce the number of patients who die while waiting.
More than 100,000 people in the United States are awaiting organ transplants in a system that has long been defined by an imbalance between supply and demand. Patients sometimes wait years for donated organs, and about 6,000 Americans a year -- 17 each day, according to the federal government -- die while waiting.
For nearly four decades, the organ donation system has been run by the United Network for Organ Sharing, a national nonprofit known as UNOS. Under contract with the federal government, the network coordinates the work of transplant hospitals and organ procurement organizations to match candidates with donated organs.
The Biden administration is now putting the network's job out to bid, hoping to foster competition in a system that has effectively operated as a monopoly. Officials say their first task is to upgrade the outdated computer system that matches organs to patients; they are now seeking bidders to do that work.
"This system and the statute that governs it are almost 40 years old," Carole Johnson, the administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the branch of the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees the transplant system, said in an interview. "Technologies improved. Government processes about transparency have improved. And so the time was ripe for us to do this."
This is not the first reform effort; 25 years ago, the Clinton administration tried its own modernization initiative. Patients and families say an overhaul is long overdue. They have argued that the system is inefficient, lacks oversight and discriminates against people of color.
"I'm thrilled," Greg Segal, the founder of the patient advocacy group Organize, said of the proposed changes. Many of Mr. Segal's family members have a genetic heart condition; his father waited five years for a heart transplant.
A report last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that the organ transplant system was "demonstrably inequitable," and suffered from "significant nonuse of donated organs," the academies said in announcing the study. Roughly one in five donated kidneys is not used, the study said.
In 2021, while seeking public comment on ways to address racial inequities in the system, the Health and Human Services Department said that Black people were four times more likely, and Latinos 1.3 times more likely, than white people to have kidney failure. But Black and Latino people who are on dialysis are less likely to be put on organ donation lists and get transplants.
The current system for organ transplants was set up in 1984, when Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act. That law created the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network's board, a panel of industry experts to determine policies regarding organ transplantation.
To carry out those policies, UNOS relies on more than 50 local organ procurement organizations -- independent groups that persuade families to donate their loved ones' organs, and arrange for the organs to be removed and delivered to transplant centers. But some of the procurement organizations operate far more effectively than others, leading to vast regional inequities.
Critics say UNOS is insular and lacks transparency. For example, some members of the UNOS board also sit on the board of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
Ms. Johnson wants to put an end to that. "The referees and the players ought to be two different entities," she said.
In a statement, UNOS said it welcomed "a competitive and open bidding process" to "advance our efforts to save as many lives as possible, as equitably as possible," and indicated that it would bid to continue running the system. "We believe we have the experience and expertise required to best serve the nation's patients," the statement said, adding that elements of the Biden administration's plan align with its own agenda.
But in the interview, Ms. Johnson made clear that she wanted to break up UNOS's functions, beginning with separating the computer matching system from the organization's other work. She said she envisioned multiple bidders for various transplant-related tasks carried out independently -- with her agency setting performance standards.
"This is about setting expectations and bringing more competition to the space," she said.
The Biden administration has also rolled out a website that will, for the first time, provide detailed, anonymized data on transplant wait lists, donors and recipients. The site will also include outcomes for individual hospitals to help patients and their families make decisions about where to seek care. The moves were reported earlier by The Washington Post.
Change will have to come slowly, said Dr. Arthur Caplan, the director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, who has studied transplant ethics for decades.
"The whole transplant system is very delicate; it relies on trust and coordination," he said. "To reform it, you have to go slowly for fear that you would cause it to halt as it tries to adjust to new requirements."
The Senate Finance Committee has been investigating ways to improve the organ donation and transplant system, and its members have been pushing for reforms. In August, the committee released a report describing what the panel's chairman, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, described as "gross mismanagement and incompetence."
Between 2010 and 2020, more than 1,100 complaints were filed by patients and families, transplant centers and others, many involving medical mistakes that led to patient injuries and deaths, the inquiry found. Between 2008 and 2015, the report said, 249 transplant recipients developed a disease from transplanted organs. More than a quarter of them died.
At a committee hearing, the executive director of AdventHealth Transplant Institute, a transplant center in Orlando, Fla., said the system was in dire need of restructuring.
"Families in need of a lifesaving organ have no option but to trust the transplantation system that is in place," said the executive director, Barry Friedman. "Unfortunately, that system has failed many awaiting organ transplant due to lack of oversight and accountability."
Tonya Ingram, a poet and health activist, was among those who died waiting for a transplant. Before her death at age 31 in December, she posted on Instagram, looking for a kidney donor; appeared in a government video; and wrote letters to members of the Biden administration and an opinion essay with the headline: "Organ donations get wasted every year. That's killing people like me."

Trend Pirouette: The Return of Ballet Flats: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Six ideal pairs of one of the season's trendiest (but hardest to get right) shoes.
While there's no doubt that ballet flats are everywhere right now, the definition of what constitutes a ballet flat is somewhat elastic. Here are some helpful parameters to keep in mind when looking for a pair of your own:
They are roughly the shape of ballet slippers with a round toe. (This seems obvious, but there's a lot of room for error.) They can have a little heel but nothing higher than a half an inch. An open toe is a no. Straps are sometimes allowed, but anything too hefty or with a buckle turns a shoe into a Mary Jane. An elastic strap works (as on the extremely popular varieties from Miu Miu or, even better, the ones from the Row). And that's it.
Maybe you're not sure how to feel about the return of this trend. Maybe, like me, you went through a ballet-flat phase a couple of decades ago and thought you were done with them. Did you love the aggressively rounded toes? Did you, like Amy Winehouse, wear them so often they were the color of hot dog water? Did you often return from a day walking around in them only to wonder why flat shoes that seemed so practical were in fact deeply uncomfortable?
Do you want to try them again, but are not sure how?
The best advice, which you must try to heed, is to resist the siren song of dressing like a ballerina. I love leotards and tiny wrap sweaters as much as the next Balanchine devotee, but don't wear ballet flats with them. Ballet flats that look too much like pointe shoes or have attached ribbons come across as costume-y.
Anyone who was obsessed with "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" knows that shoes like this wear out easily. So while you may find secondhand eggplant-colored Dior ballet flats with a braid or chocolate brown suede Lilly Pulitzer ones with a champagne metallic trim, you will have to sort through a lot of really worn-out pairs.
When you find the right ballet flats for you, get a cobbler to put a slip resistant tread on the soles, which will give the shoes a longer life. While you're there, get a padded insole to make them a little easier to wear.
Chanel
It turns out ballet dancers do wear ballet flats. Jenelle Manzi, who dances with the New York City Ballet, said on Instagram that she "can't even look at" one popular brand, "mostly because I think about the poor bones in my feet, but I got the perfect pair of ballet flats in Paris last summer at Chanel."
If a ballerina endorsement doesn't move you, know that Chanel ballet flats look good with everything. Also, they have a cap toe, and sometimes the toe contrasts with the rest of the flat, like a black toe with a pastel tweed, or a navy toe with a blue-green leather body. This being Chanel, notorious for its low levels of stock, you have to go in person and see what is available in your size. If you find any crayon-style colors in a size 39 -- taxi yellow, bright blue -- call me immediately. ( $ 875)
Maison Margiela
Maison Margiela is known for its many variations of the split-toe tabi shoe. Its fans are devoted to the tabi boots, but I think the tabi ballet flat is the friendliest entry point into that world. My friend Kat pointed me to the satin ones. "They're the softest tabis (spiritually)," she texted. The colors are really incredible -- deep violet, dark sage green, chestnut brown -- and would look good with any kind of jeans, but even better with oversize tailored trousers and a loose oxford shirt. ( $ 345, from $ 690)
Khaite
Khaite makes ballet flats with studded with Swarovski crystals. The best are black satin with the crystals in a kind of harlequin pattern. The more elaborate and luxe the ballet flat, the better it looks dressed down. So wear these with track shorts in the summer and a white ribbed tank top and you'll be the coolest person at the grocery store. ( $ 980)
The Row
Ballet flats can look a little too preppy when worn with skirts and dresses. They need the structure and square toe of these satin ones from the Row. How good would the cranberry red pair look peeking out from under a long black dress at some kind of spring gala? The bonus is that this is the next most comfortable thing with the exception of socks to wear to a long party. ( $ 790)
Reike Nen
It's easy to take for granted the delicate bows of many ballet flats. They're just kind of there, looking perfect. This pair has an elongated toe box and a bow that hits the middle of the foot, instead of at the toe. "The Reikes are more substantial as a styling element," said Anna Gray, who owns Club Vintage in Manhattan, a South Street Seaport shop that sells this style. So even though they are as versatile as a black shoe should be, they are subtly more elegant. And slightly less innocent. And so are you! ( $ 280, from $ 350)
Mansur Gavriel
Mansur Gavriel makes ballet flats with a high vamp, which some people prefer to showing a lot of toe cleavage. They do all the basic colors (Repetto and Margaux and French Sole also have a range of great shades), but the most exciting version is made of raffia. With white linen pants? Or what about Pleats Please pants for a contrast of soft and natural meets futuristic? ( $ 395)

In Designer's Farewell, Moschino Loses Laughs: [Style Desk]

Full text: In a fashion world surprise, the designer is leaving the Italian label he has helmed for 10 years.
Fashion is about to get a little less funny. In yet another major industry surprise, Jeremy Scott is leaving his post as the creative director of Moschino, the brand's parent company said in a statement on Monday. His departure ends a 10-year tenure that rejuvenated the brand by using it as a vehicle to poke fun at consumerism while simultaneously celebrating it in visual stunts tailor-made for the Instagram era. No successor has been named.
After the designer Alessandro Michele left Gucci in November, the move will further reshape the Italian fashion world, where Mr. Scott's ability to inject a kind of ironic postmodern pop humor into clothes catapulted Moschino to new relevance.
The brand became a favorite of celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, who once wore a Moschino T-shirt dress splashed with the words "I had nothing to wear so I put on this Moschino dress," and Katy Perry, who wore a Moschino chandelier and a Moschino hamburger to the Met Gala in 2019.
Massimo Ferretti, the chairman of Aeffe, the group that owns Moschino, in a statement thanked Mr. Scott for "ushering in a distinct and joyful vision that will forever be a part of Moschino history."
Mr. Scott, 47, who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and studied at the Pratt Institute in New York, was only the third designer to lead the house, which was founded by Franco Moschino in 1983 to celebrate the virtues of elegant irreverence. After Mr. Moschino's death in 1994 from complications of AIDS, Rosella Jardini took over, gamely carrying on the legacy until Mr. Scott arrived in 2013 with his own sense of subversive humor.
Almost immediately, his way with a fashion pun resonated with a generation reared on social media (so much so that in 2015, Mr. Scott was tapped to redesign the "Moonman" statuette given to winners at MTV's Video Music Awards). Mr. Scott sent riffs on McDonald's and Barbie down the runway, made Le Smokings that were literally smoking in a nod to the Bonfire of the Vanities, and last September created an entire ode to inflatables because -- well, you know, inflation (and who can't use a life raft now and again?).
When Covid-19 put live fashion shows on hold, Mr. Scott presented a collection worn by marionettes crafted in Jim Henson's studio. He populated the show's pseudo front row with puppet versions of fashion editors like Anna Wintour and Edward Enninful, inviting watchers to ponder the question of who in fashion really pulls the strings.
A dress Mr. Scott designed for a Moschino collection inspired by game-show kitsch, which featured an entire TV dinner on its train, played a starring role in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 2019 exhibition "Camp: Notes on Fashion." (That dress was one of about 15 Moschino outfits in the show.) Alongside the runway stunts, Mr. Scott was canny enough to offer special collections with T-shirts and phone cases, allowing everyone access to his Moschino world.
Sometimes the jokes could fall flat, but overall the result was a boom in sales, at least until last year. In 2022, Aeffe -- which also owns the brands Alberta Ferretti, Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini and Pollini -- reported a loss of nine million euros (about $ 10 million) on revenues of 352 million euros (about $ 377 million), thanks in part to complications in China.
"He took chances, but always with a sense of fun," said Robert Burke, the founder of a namesake luxury consultancy, of Mr. Scott. "He was a great match for Moschino."
Though Mr. Scott had maintained his own eponymous brand throughout most of his time at Moschino, in recent seasons it has been put on hold. Whether it will now be revived, or whether, as he once suggested, he will move into movies, Mr. Scott did not reveal. In a text message from Seoul, where he is introducing a new collaboration with Hyundai, he simply said, "Every book has chapters and as I end this chapter, I am excited to share with the world my next chapter."
It is unclear whether Mr. Scott's tenure at Moschino ended because of a shift in the general mood in the industry, which is turning away from buzz-making theatrics and toward "timelessness" as sales of classic luxury brands including Chanel and Hermès soar, or whether, as some conventional wisdom has it, a decade is simply long enough for a single creative director to helm a fashion house. Both Mr. Scott and the Aeffe group declined to elaborate on the statement announcing his departure.
The fashion game of designer musical chairs continues.

How to Read a Menu Like a Food Critic: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: It's harder than it seems. So Pete Wells and Tejal Rao have tips.
This week marks one year of Where to Eat. What I hoped would be a digestible, funny and useful weekly guide to eating out in New York City is now a community of readers with thoughtful questions and strong opinions.
How to celebrate one year? Traditionally, with the gift of paper. More specifically here: menus. Someone recently asked me, "How do you decide what to order?" And I realized that being able to parse a menu is a real skill. So I chatted with two diners extraordinaire -- our restaurant critic, Pete Wells, and our critic-at-large, Tejal Rao -- in hopes of helping you all eat the way the critics eat.
Our regularly scheduled program will resume next week. But for now, thank you so much for reading this newsletter -- and here's to another good year of great eating.
What should diners look out for on menus?
Tejal: Sometimes menus are structured so that they call attention to one thing. It's worth being a little skeptical about that. Is the steak highlighted in its own little box going to be a showstopper, or is it just a big-ticket item distracting me from more interesting dishes? And if a dish relies on pretty high quality, in-season ingredients, you don't want to order it out of season.
Pete: I try to skim and read the whole thing cover-to-cover, if it's long. Of course, your eye goes to things you don't see in every restaurant. Anything that looks different or original. And if a chef is going to put something really classic and familiar on the menu, it challenges them to take it to a level that will surprise you.
What are your always-orders?
Pete: No one ever wants to get the soup. I always want to get the soup, but it's hard to share. When there's soup on the menu, that's interesting, because somebody took the trouble to make it and it's never going to be a huge seller.
Tejal: If I haven't seen puntarelle for months and all of a sudden it's in season, I'm ordering puntarelle. And I hope it's served with anchovies and olive oil. But it's OK if it's not. I just want it, you know? Same goes for fresh sardines -- I can't help it.
What do you rarely order?
Pete: The steak is almost always super-plain. And I rarely order a burger. There's so little you can do to a burger that will really knock me out. For a while cheffed-up burgers were a novelty, and then there were so many good ones I just take it for granted now that one chef's burger will be pretty much like all the other ones.
Tejal: I'm never going to order the braised short rib. Short ribs are served on airplanes and at catered parties, and it's because they are a cheap, forgiving cut. It's hard to mess it up. Not to say that the most elaborate thing on the menu is what's worth getting, but I'd rather order something I wouldn't cook at home.
How often do you rely on servers for advice?
Pete: At a newer restaurant, I tend to only ask if I'm down to two things and I can't decide. Whereas at a place where the menu never changes and they've been around for years, clear favorites start to emerge, and the waiters know what's generally good.
Tejal: Some servers make it really clear that they're super-familiar with the food and they've tasted everything. But usually I will put in the order and then say, "Is there anything really amazing that I've missed?"
What advice do you have for diners who think they're not adventurous?
Nikita: I'll take this one. I think the secret to widening your horizon is to always order one thing you wouldn't normally try. I almost never order a shrimp dish, but I will always try it if someone else orders it. Call it exposure therapy. It's perfectly fine to have food preferences -- I don't know if I'll ever come around on runny egg yolks, sorry! -- but continually pushing yourself out of your comfort zone has nothing but upside. I promise.
In Other News ...
This week Pete Wells reviewed Kebab aur Sharab, on the Upper West Side, which offers "a whole specialized line of kebabs from around India that takes up three pages on the menu," he writes, making dining there "an event."
Openings: The bistro Virginia's returns this Thursday in a new space with the chef Justin Lee (formerly of Fat Choy and Barbuto) at the helm; Benny John's Bar & Grill, a new steakhouse, will arrive at East 48th Street this week; and the Taim Mediterranean Kitchen chain will open a location in Fresh Meadows, Queens, on Wednesday.
How to save a struggling small town? Well, having Reba McEntire on your side certainly helps. Priya Krishna reported on Atoka, Okla., and the opening of Reba's Place, a restaurant and collaboration between Ms. McEntire, a local hero, and the Choctaw Nation.
Molly Fitzpatrick reported on the rise of American-made aperitifs and digestifs and the producers working to create the next Campari.

Full text: The 23-year-old British musician is a breakout star of a dance-music revival largely led by Black women artists. Her new EP, "Sunrise Bang Ur Head Against Tha Wall," is out Friday.
About 300 dance music fans were packed into a north London club late last year, waiting for Nia Archives, a jungle artist and D.J., to begin her set.
Jungle and its successor drum-and-bass emerged in Britain in the 1990s, and club nights dedicated to these styles of dance music can often attract older crowds dominated by men looking to hear the relentlessly rhythmic sounds of their youth. But this evening was different: Young women were front and center in the crowd.
As Nia Archives, 23, sang over her own soulful tracks or dropped frantic remixes of rap hits with rumbling bass lines, groups of men tried to barge their way forward, but the women stuck out their elbows, held the men back and kept on dancing.
Casey Forbes, 19, felt she "had to" stay at the front, she said afterward. "I'm a big fan of jungle music," she added, "but there's not much women playing, especially Black women, so seeing her onstage and performing her own music, she's a big inspiration."
Behind her decks, Archives danced from side to side, her nails painted in the colors of the Jamaican flag, her long braids flying around her.

Jungle and drum-and-bass have been two of Britain's most popular forms of dance music for nearly 30 years, and many of their pioneers are now middle-aged. Britain's music press regularly proclaims a new act or two is revitalizing, or even "saving," the genres. In recent years, a host of female artists, many of whom are Black, have been identified as the music's next big things, including the D.J.-producer Sherelle and the singer and producer PinkPantheress, who regularly uses drum-and-bass beats in her songs.
Archives, whose music combines clattering beats with emotional vocals, is the latest with breakout buzz. In January, she took third place in the BBC's Sound of 2023, a long-running annual poll that has previously tipped Billie Eilish, Wet Leg and Adele for success. That accolade came just weeks after Archives won best electronic dance act at Britain's Music of Black Origin (MOBO) awards, and followed a summer spent D.J.ing at major festivals like Glastonbury.
Her third EP, "Sunrise Bang Ur Head Against Tha Wall," released Friday, follows "Headz Gone West" from 2021, which she recorded in her bedroom studio, and "Forbidden Feelingz" from last year, which opens with "Ode 2 Maya Angelou," a track that blends stuttering breakbeats with the writer's "Still I Rise."
Speaking on a recent call from Los Angeles, Archives -- who declined to give her real name -- said the new EP was an attempt to experiment with different sounds and meld jungle with other genres "whilst still being true to what I do."
The release includes "So Tell Me...," which features indie guitars and glossy strings alongside clattering drums; "That's Tha Way Life Goes," a track she said was inspired by an obsession with bossa nova; and "Baianá," an uproarious instrumental with vocals sampled from an old Brazilian record and a decades-old interview with DJ Patife, one of that country's main drum-and-bass stars.
In an earlier video call, Archives said she's been inspired by female predecessors in British dance music, like DJ Flight and DJ Storm. "It's representation," she added. "It's really important to see yourself in music."
When she used to go to parties as a teenager, she said, she would sometimes see men nod toward her then remark to their friends, "You don't see Black girls in raves like this." Today, Archives observed, women feel "comfortable to just be themselves and have fun."
That shift has been noticed by Natalie Wright, who began performing as DJ Flight over 25 years ago. Wright said that in the 1990s she was "so tunnel vision and passionate" about wanting to make it as a drum-and-bass D.J., she didn't let sexist comments or the lack of women stars bother her, "until quite a bit later." In 2018, she co-founded EQ50, an organization to encourage gender diversity in drum-and-bass music.
Two years later, it launched a mentoring program for women and nonbinary artists; Archives was accepted from among 80 applicants.
Wright said Archives immediately stood out because she was able "to do everything" -- from producing great beats to writing grabby hooks. Archives also had "that slightly different charisma" that seemed necessary for stardom, she added.
Another of Archives' favorite artists has become a fan: Jayne Conneely, better known as DJ Storm, said Archives is "like a little sponge" always looking to learn from older stars: "She's a force to be reckoned with."
Growing up in Leeds, a city in northern England, Archives said she was surrounded by music from a young age -- hearing gospel at her local Jamaican Pentecostal church, rap at home and drum-and-bass at carnivals.
At 16, she left a difficult home life and moved to Manchester, where she began to write music. "I'd been through a really turbulent time," she said, "and I had no way to process how I was feeling, so that was what I used." Soon, she was crafting tracks likes "Crossroads," which she has said was about her relationship with her mother. ("Tell me, who do I turn to?" she sings. "I used to trust you, but you said things that were untrue.")
She initially sang over rap beats, but found the songs sounded too sad. Eventually, she sped the music up to "disguise the emotions I'm actually feeling with these crazy jungle drums," she said. That formula clicked.
During the height of the pandemic, Archives spent 500 pounds, or a little over $ 600, of a student loan on Instagram ads to promote her debut single, "Sober Feels." Its hook -- "I don't like how sober feels" -- seemed to resonate with Britons who couldn't party during the country's lockdowns, she said. A month later, Spotify was adding another of her tracks to its New Music Friday U.K. playlist. "That's when I was like, 'Oh my gosh, OK, things can start happening really,"' she added, stunned that her bedroom music could travel so far.
Though her songs are finding wider audiences, Archives said she said she is still writing to process her own emotions. One track on the new EP, "Conveniency," is about an unrequited love over the past year, she said, while "So Tell Me ..." is about her seven-year estrangement from her mother.
Estrangement is a topic she felt compelled to tackle to give hope to others who come from challenging home environments. "I don't have a mom or a dad, and for someone my age, it's really hard to navigate adulthood and being a women without anyone to show you how to do that," she said.
A future debut album would also involve more musical experimentation, she said. Her call from Los Angeles came during a two-week recording trip that included writing sessions with the singer and violinist Sudan Archives, the rapper and producer Jpegmafia and the producer DJ Dahi. She was "just trying to make something new and fun," she said, but she insisted her work would have jungle music at its core.
She needed to "be true to what I do," she said: "My drums are my identity."

Fake Buyers Are Phishing In Art World: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Young artists say they often receive offers by email to purchase their paintings, but many are part of schemes to defraud them by using fake checks and phony shipping companies.
Many young artists survive their early careers with commissions from friends and family. Zachary Ginsberg was no different, participating in local fairs and selling his portraits to relatives for a couple of hundred dollars.
Then his biggest score appeared out of nowhere. A stranger emailed through the painter's website to inquire about a $ 3,400 purchase.
It seemed too good to be true -- and it was.
What happened next followed a pattern seen in nearly a dozen attempts at defrauding artists of their paintings and money that were reviewed by The New York Times. In each case, young artists were offered an attractive price for artworks by "collectors" who sent them checks to cover the price of the work and the cost of shipping it. Each of them was then asked to forward the shipping fee by money order to a person who was arranging the delivery.
Ginsberg sent $ 2,060 to the aptly named Linda Shady, who was supposed to be a shipping agent based in Fond du Lac, Wis. That name turned out to be fictitious and the person apparently used fake identification to cash the money order before Ginsberg was told by his bank that the $ 6,210 check he had received -- more than he asked for -- had not cleared.
"That was when I realized it was fraud," Ginsberg said.
Cybercrime experts said fake check scams were growing. Though it did not study art scams per se, a study published in February by the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Sentinel Network tallied more than $ 124 million in damages from more than 40,000 cases involving fraudulent foreign money offers or fake checks.
Most of the cases start with an email from a fictitious person, a subset of the surge in phishing that has greatly increased the vulnerability of communications online. A study by the tech security company SlashNext projected that there were more than 255 million phishing attacks in 2022 through email, mobile and other online channels. That was 61 percent higher than the rate of phishing attacks the company tallied a year before.
Chelsea Binns, a cybercrime expert who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said the size of the problem was overwhelming the law enforcement response.
"The police want to solve crime, but they are limited in what they can do," Binns said. "There is no recourse because the perpetrator is usually anonymous and could be located anywhere in the world."
Ginsberg received his first message in August 2021 from someone going by the name Mark Stewart, who requested an immediate sale of the painting because his wedding anniversary was around the corner. The painting would be a surprise for his wife, who, Stewart said in one email, had spotted the artist's work online and found it "impressive and intriguing."
Stewart mentioned that he was moving to the Philippines and would need to use an expensive shipping company to complete the transaction. In text messages, the buyer said he would send Ginsberg a big check to cover both the price of the work and the shipping costs.
Why a check? He didn't want his wife seeing the extra purchase on their credit card statement.
Ginsberg said in an interview that he was a little worried when the buyer wanted a financial transaction involving a money order. But he reassured himself by searching online and finding someone who matched Stewart's description in Texas, where he had claimed to be from.
Then the check bounced. Ginsberg, a senior at Columbia University, tried to reach Stewart without success and then approached law enforcement authorities, including several police precincts near the campus for help.
"This was on my first day of classes and I was running from police station to police station," the artist recalled. "The local precinct said there was nothing they could do."
In December, the gallerist Jason Horejs blogged about the hundreds of scam emails that his dealership in Scottsdale, Ariz., has received over the years. Nearly 70 people responded to the essay, saying they had similar experiences of someone reaching out to buy paintings as wedding presents.
Through dozens of emails, the gallerist had conversed with a woman who said she was from Georgia. The woman attempted to convince Horejs, according to the emails, that a fraudulent check she sent to his gallery would cover the $ 4,000 artwork and an extra $ 5,000 needed for shipping. She even provided what appeared to be a valid Social Security number as proof of her identity.
But it was another case where a person had potentially stolen someone's identity and was using her information to pass muster.
In Horejs's case, he suspected that something was off and decided not to take part in the sale. The woman responded with vague threats: "Have banker do the needful and get back to me," she said in one email, "because if I report to my boss about this, your account will be reversed and flagged as fraud. You will loose everything." Enough gallerists and artists have fallen victim to these fake check scams that many art schools now instruct students to report suspicious activity and avoid sharing too much personal information on social media.
"Depending on the severity of the scam, campus security and the authorities are brought in to assist with the incident," said David Soto, director of cybersecurity at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. "We assist the student with trying to recover any lost or encrypted data and try to provide them with the tools they need to avoid scams in the future."
Jane South, Pratt's chairwoman of fine arts, said the nature of scams targeting young artists had changed through the years. The fake check scams will sometimes start through direct messages on Instagram or Twitter. More recent attempts have involved requests to transform student artworks into NFTs for a price.
"They are preying on the vulnerability of young artists who want their work to be validated," South explained. "That is something we address when we discuss professional practices: how to be empowered in your part of a conversation with prospective collectors."
Ginsberg learned the hard way. Almost two years later, he remains frustrated by the ordeal. "I was very upset with myself because it felt like the beginning of something that I had wanted for a long time," he said. "I thought it could be leverage for other sales. Maybe someone would see my work at his house."
The artist has continued receiving dozens of fake requests for his paintings. The inquiries come from new email addresses with names like Phil Ferdinand, Karen Harris and Daniel Jackson.
As it happens, a Daniel Jackson also emailed this reporter, who writes about art but does not have a website filled with paintings and sculpture to buy. Jackson said he wanted cartoon illustrations for a presentation about the Covid-19 pandemic.
He offered $ 6,800 for the commission, which included a request for images of people socially distancing and wearing masks, as well as a cemetery of tombstones with a caption reading "Died of disbelief."
When asked how payment would be handled, Jackson responded: "I can only propose a certified check."
Do not hold your breath, Jackson.

Polito Vega, New York Radio's 'King' of Salsa, Is Dead at 84: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a career that began in 1960, the Puerto Rico-born Mr. Vega became, one admirer said, "the architect of Hispanic radio at a global level."
Polito Vega, an exuberant announcer with a booming bass voice and a finely attuned ear whose Spanish-language shows popularized salsa music in New York in the mid-1960s, died on March 9 in North Bergen, N.J. He was 84.
His death was announced by his family. No cause was given.
After abandoning his dreams of becoming a singer, Mr. Vega began his broadcasting career in 1960, shortly after transplanting himself from Puerto Rico to New York. He quickly distinguished himself on air with his signature voice, his perky epigrams like "Andando, andando, andando" ("Keep going") and his adventurous playlists. He also distinguished himself in person, at concerts and dances, with his ubiquitous Yankees cap, starched white guayabera shirt, white goatee and fuzzy sideburns.
The disc jockey and recording artist Alex Sensation described Mr. Vega on Instagram as "the architect of Hispanic radio at a global level."
In an obituary in Billboard magazine, Leila Cobo, the author of "Decoding 'Despacito': An Oral History of Latin Music" (2020), wrote: "Vega's importance to Latin music cannot be overstated. He was the most influential tastemaker in the country's top market, dating back to when tropical music first became popular in the city in the 1960s and 1970s and stretching all the way to the 21st century."
He was heard on two New York AM stations, first WEVD and then WBNX, and finally on WSKQ (Mega 97.9 FM) -- which began broadcasting as a full-time Spanish-language format in 1989 and has often been rated No. 1 in that market. He also became the station's program director.
When Mr. Vega began broadcasting, he recalled, he was struck by the disconnect between the comparatively temperate bolero music that dominated Latin broadcasting and the feverish salsa he was encountering in nightclubs. He was among the first radio personalities to recognize the market for salsa, identifying promising talent and mentoring gifted musicians.
"It was two different worlds in those early days," Mr. Vega said told The New York Times in 2009. "At the dance halls and up in the Catskills you would hear the Tito Puente and Machito orchestras tearing things up, but on the radio the kind of thing you heard was romantic trios, unless you were tuning in to Symphony Sid" -- the prominent jazz D.J. who began playing Afro-Cuban music in the 1960s -- "late at night."
The trombonist Willie Colón, who became one of salsa's biggest stars, recalled that the first time he heard Yomo Toro, the maestro of the 10-string guitar known as the cuatro, with whom he would later collaborate on several recordings, "was on Polito's show, playing along with listeners who would call in and sing over the telephone."
In the late 1960s, Mr. Colón got a break when he was invited to appear on "Club de la Juventud," an "American Bandstand"-inspired TV show that Mr. Vega hosted on the Telemundo network from 1967 to 1970.
Among the other musicians whose careers Mr. Vega helped promote were Celia Cruz, Tito Puente and Ismael Miranda.
Hipólito Vega Torres was born on Aug. 3, 1938, in Ponce, on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. His father was a bus driver, and the young Hipólito sold newspapers on the beach to supplement his family's income.
He began calling himself Polito as a teenager after winning an amateur singing competition, only to be told by the contest's master of ceremonies that he would never become a celebrity with a name like Hipólito.
In 1957 he moved to New York City, where he lived with an uncle near Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx and worked as a shipping clerk while trying to get a break in the music business.
"I came to New York as a skinny little kid with a wisp of a mustache, hoping to make it as a singer," he said in 2009.
Johnny Pacheco, the Dominican-born flutist, bandleader, songwriter and producer, knew Mr. Vega in those days. "Even before Polito got a job, he was already an announcer," Mr. Pacheco, who died in 2021, told The Times. "He used to go to a barbershop owned by a compadre of mine, and I remember how he was always joking and kidding around there, imitating announcers and singers and talking as if he were already on the air."
One night in 1960 he was helping a friend who was hosting "Fiesta Time," a half-hour show on WEVD; as his friend's sidekick, he read listeners' names and record requests on the air. The station's owner heard his voice and hired him as an announcer.
"Radio fever got into my head," Mr. Vega recalled.
When WEVD expanded to 24-hour programming not long after that, he was offered the midnight-to-6 a.m. slot.
"The show," he later said, "was so successful and I felt that liberty to express myself that I've maintained to this day."
Mr. Pacheco, who co-founded Fania Records in 1964 as New York was supplanting Cuba as a center for emerging Latin music, described Mr. Vega in 2009 as "part of the whole salsa movement, one of its pillars."
"As we were building the company," he added, "he was there with us. I'd bring him the LPs, he'd listen and say, 'I like this song, I'm going to push it,' and he'd play the hell out of it."
Mr. Vega later moved to WBNX, where he became known as "El Rey de la Radio" -- the King of Radio -- and where he met Raúl Alarcón, the senior program director. Mr. Alarcón went on to become head of the Spanish Broadcasting System, where Mr. Vega was for many years executive vice president in charge of programming.
In 2009, Mr. Vega was honored at two all-star 50th-anniversary concerts at Madison Square Garden. Three years later he was celebrated at Citi Field in Queens by a lineup that included Gloria Estefan and Daddy Yankee.
Mr. Vega's wife, Judith, died in 2012. His survivors include two sons and a daughter. Two other sons died before him.
In a statement, his family asked that his fans not mourn but "celebrate his legacy," adding: "Polito continues to live in the music that he loved and shared, as well as the impact he left in the Latin community. Polito lived happiness, smiles and love. We would like for all his fans to live life to the fullest, as he did."

The New Prime Time for TV News: Afternoons

There’s a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it’s “The Five,” the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama “Yellowstone,” was last year’s most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber’s 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC — the first time in the network’s 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors’ careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that’s changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.
The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus — or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night — America’s news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
“The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now,” said Mosheh Oinounou, a former “CBS Evening News” executive producer. “It’s no different from traditional TV; the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show.”
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans older than 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans older than 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 — the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
“Unless there’s something super compelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch,” said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. “There’s so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ on streaming. It’s hard for the news to compete with Maverick.”
For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few long-standing assumptions.
For one thing, prime-time hosts don’t necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were — and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day’s news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network’s new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing “fresh and unique perspectives to the news,” but it’s also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN’s 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network’s highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot temporarily by moving Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks and dismal ratings, Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, “The Lead,” now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN’s evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program “The Rachel Maddow Show” was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC’s prime-time viewership above that of Fox News — the cable news ratings king — in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, political analyst Alex Wagner, has beaten CNN in total viewership, but her 2023 ratings are tracking about 30% lower than what Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Melber and Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC’s prime-time audience declined 21% from a year prior, and CNN lost 33%.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2% from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, “The Five,” is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, “The Five” leaped past Carlson last year to achieve Fox News’ biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Carlson still outranks “The Five” among adults younger than 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show’s success. “People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is ‘The Five,’” Lachlan Murdoch, CEO of the Fox Corp., said at an investor conference on March 9. “It’s a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics.”
“The Five” has also incubated two of the network’s rising stars. Fox News turned to Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its strait-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
“The Five” isn’t the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Watters’ 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that for generations summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
“This is what we’ve been seeing for years,” Oinounou said, laughing. “People look for a digest of news as they’re about to eat dinner, and then we’ll send you to more traditional entertainment — written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington.”

Full text: Viewership of Lena Dunham's HBO dramedy is surging as many millennials reassess their 20s and a show that defined them.
Jill Badlotto was in her 20s when she developed a "love-hate" relationship with the HBO dramedy "Girls." While the show aired, Ms. Badlotto watched the main characters -- Hannah, Marnie, Jessa and Shoshanna -- hop from unpaid gigs to Brooklyn raves, all the while criticizing one another for the narcissism they failed to recognize in themselves.
When Ms. Badlotto, now 35 and a wedding coordinator in South Florida, rewatched the show this year, the characters still grated on her. But this time she didn't recoil so strongly.
"I see so much more of myself in them," she said, then paused. "Maybe that's why I hated them so much."
A little over a decade after the show's debut, people are rewatching -- and sometimes reconsidering -- "Girls," Lena Dunham's series about four white women lurching through their 20s in New York City. The series' viewership doubled between November and January compared with the previous three months, according to a spokesperson for HBO.
Returning and first-time viewers are dissecting the show in bars and group chats, uploading supercuts to TikTok and using "Girls" to reflect on the very recent past. (In Season 1, Marnie uses a Blackberry and Jessa has a flip phone.)
"I like to call it a period piece," said Julia Gray, 27, a journalist in Brooklyn and the host of "Girls Room," a "Girls" rewatch podcast she created last year.
"Girls" was released in 2012 amid a flurry of hot takes that argued millennials were the whiniest, laziest generation yet. The show knowingly played into and poked fun at those clichés beginning with its first episode, in which Ms. Dunham's character, Hannah, is cut off by her parents and then declares that she may be the voice -- "or at least a voice" -- of her generation.
It also, perhaps unwittingly, was a time capsule of what life was like for a privileged slice of New York City in the mid-2010s. The show's protagonists had just graduated into a recession and were grappling with the rise of apps like Instagram and Tinder, all while going through the typical turmoil of one's 20s.
That was too much verisimilitude for some viewers. But now well into their 30s, some of the millennials rewatching "Girls" are seeing their early adulthood with greater clarity.
"It just resonates so much more now," said Alix Seracki, 30, a photographer in Manhattan who is rewatching the show with four friends. They are revisiting plot lines like Hannah's on-again, off-again relationship with Adam (Adam Driver) and her revolving cast of roommates. The phrase "so real" peppers their text messages.
"This notion of 'rewatching' is a misnomer, because you're re-introspecting," said Cristel Antonia Russell, a professor of marketing at the Graziadio Business School at Pepperdine University, who does research on television consumption habits.
Professor Russell said a primary reason we rewatch television -- a practice she believes has gotten more popular in the last decade because of streaming and its endless options -- is to appreciate how we have changed between viewings of a show that has remained the same. A series like "Girls," which is about lost 20-somethings, could be comforting to 30-somethings who have weathered the chaos of those years, she said.
When Ms. Badlotto watched the show for the first time, she said, she was frustrated when Hannah enrolled in and promptly abandoned an M.F.A. program at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.
This year, Ms. Badlotto rewatched the show and saw the exact same story line as a realistic demonstration of trial and error -- an essential part of growing up. "That's kind of the beautiful thing about being in your 20s: It's really the only time in your life when you're able to do that," she said.
When the show was originally broadcast, it seemed to stir up much stronger feelings. It cycled between phases of backlash and backlash-to-the-backlash over its nudity and sex scenes, its whiteness (and its creative team's defenses of it), its characters' narcissism and the statements, and often the body, of its creator, Ms. Dunham. In 2017, Vulture published a 1,500-word list of all of the show's controversies.
That "Girls" was such a lightning rod for criticism in its day makes it especially rich to discuss a decade later, Ms. Gray said, especially now that more shows, like "Insecure" and "Fleabag," have gone on to feature women who do not have it all figured out.
On her podcast, she revisited a Season 2 scene in which Hannah plays table tennis, naked, with a fling played by Patrick Wilson. Ms. Dunham's nudity was often received with outrage or praise, but a decade later Ms. Gray said she saw it as radically neutral. Ms. Dunham was "not even doing it as a body-positive statement, just kind of, 'this is my body, this is a normal person's body,"' she said. "She was really ahead of her time there."
But there are other aspects of the show that Ms. Gray thinks are still worthy of scrutiny. "Like, the token Black character is a Republican," she said, referring to a love interest of Hannah's in the second season played by Donald Glover. "What are you trying to say? It's not working."
Tameka Amado, 30, a consultant in Boston, had been wary of the show when it first aired because of some of these criticisms. She said she had skipped the show because she did not think it would speak to her, a college-age Black woman. "I always heard, like, Lena Dunham being this problematic fave," she said.
But when she saw a clip of the show on TikTok in which Shoshanna, played by Zosia Mamet, tears down the other women's egos in a beach house, she decided to watch for the first time. She was frustrated by the show's dearth of Black characters, but she thought it captured privileged white women pretty well. "Although in the end I hated everyone, I hated everyone because the writing was so good," she said.
Ms. Dunham is aware of the "Girls" renaissance. On a phone call from Berlin, she said she was honored and a bit baffled by viewers' renewed interest, which she found out about through texts from friends. She said she hoped viewers would appreciate the show despite the fact that some jokes may not land in 2023.
"My wish is that they'll be able to maybe watch it away from some of the baggage it came with of the moment," she said.
Even Ms. Dunham senses newfound distance between herself and the material. She recently watched a TikTok montage a friend sent her of Marnie (Allison Williams) and her love interest Charlie (Christopher Abbott) set to a Phoebe Bridgers song.
"I was actually quite moved," Ms. Dunham said. "I almost forgot I had anything to do with it."

The Annoying Roommate Is Slaying on TikTok: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sabrina Brier is finding success online in the role of a 20-something in New York who's trying to shed her basic suburban past.
It was a dark Saturday night last month on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Saturday nights can get very dark, but Sabrina Brier, in a rhinestone necklace and strapless plaid pantsuit, was agleam onstage at a basement comedy club called Caveat warming up the crowd.
"You're the butter, I'm the microwave," she announced.
That particular joke passed quickly, but the metaphor hung in the air. After some years sweating on the back burner of show business, Ms. Brier, 28, has found instant success on the social media platform of the moment, TikTok. She has over 400,000 followers, and many more fans who view, "like" and share her videos, which mostly parody life as a young woman of some privilege and erratic self-confidence vacillating between the excitement of the city and the reassuring comforts of suburbia. ("You see this nook? Perfect for a pumpkin," she declared in one about reclaiming fall, the supposed favorite season of "basic" white women. "Don't blame me, blame the architect!")
Ms. Brier specializes in point of view, or P.O.V., videos that confront relatable, often hateable characters, with a subtle sneer, gleefully rubbery body and arch delivery of generational catchphrases like "slay, queen" and "I got you," often repeated for effect. She recently spoofed the Get Ready With Me (GR.W.M.) genre that has women across America smearing makeup on their faces, plugging beauty products and oversharing in equal measure.
P.O.V. of that GR.W.M.: "the girl who bullied you in high school is trying to be an influencer."
In a five-part series on the "Extremely Passive Aggressive Roommate," Ms. Brier pretends not to care about taking out the trash when it isn't her day; enforces a rule about not having people over on weeknights; complains about her roomie coming home at 3:27 a.m.; strong-arms that roommate into renewing their lease and then welcomes a guest to "the common space." (The first three videos have each been seen millions of times.) Ms. Brier's own real-life roommate, Alice Duchen, an I.C.U. nurse, is often behind the camera, deadpan.
The two women live in Greenwich Village, near a rack of CitiBikes (Ms. Brier has also sent up the CitiBike poser who ostentatiously bleats "on your left!"), in a small two-bedroom walk-up apartment. She's on a lower floor than the character she plays in one of her most popular videos, who breathlessly urges a visitor to ascend six flights of stairs in a building she's trying to argue is luxury: "It's going to be so worth it! Come on!"
Eleven days before the Caveat comedy show, Ms. Brier sat in her apartment's dining area before a plate of untouched cookies, under a collection of paintings by her paternal grandmother, and told her origin story.
Her mother, Susan Cinoman, is a playwright currently working on a feminist retelling of the King Arthur legend who divorced Ms. Brier's father, a cardiologist, when she was 5. "Very cordial," Ms. Brier said. "Not any big drama."
She has an older sister, Gabrielle, now a producer, and they were obsessed with Disney Channel when little, staging a modern-day "Cinderella "-- "except instead of the ball it's like a Britney Spears concert" -- and later "rom-com girlie movies" like "Clueless" and "Mean Girls."
Ms. Brier was in the sixth grade when she first got a phone, the Verizon Chocolate. "We were the A.I.M. generation," she said, never dreaming that a phone could one day be a portal to everything. She attended Amity High School, where she won first place in a Shakespeare competition with a monologue from "The Taming of the Shrew," not sure comedy was her winning strategy. "It was such a thing where the boys were the ones who got to have the personality, right? The boys were the class clowns." She loosened up at Smith College, an all-women's liberal arts college, where she majored in theater and took improv classes.
"It was always easy to identify her as someone who was performative," Ms. Cinoman said on the phone. "She wasn't an extrovert per se, but half of Sabrina was looking out the window at all times. Some other set of realities were impinging on the one that we were all in with her."
After graduation, Ms. Brier worked in talent management for two years, and then got an assistant job in the writers' room of "For Life," an ABC drama about a wrongfully convicted man who becomes a prison lawyer to exonerate himself. "I am a fiend for anything that makes me cry," Ms. Brier said. "Inside every comedienne is a sad girl, and that's definitely me."
After one season, Covid arrived. Restless in quarantine, she began posting videos on Instagram, one of which got picked up by Barstool, the popular sports blog. But this was before Reels. "It would be kind of blurry, and it wasn't translating, and I didn't understand it, and felt old," she said. Then she tossed up a few on TikTok, notably one in which she faux-naively referred to Houston Street in New York, which is pronounced How-ston, as Hew-ston. Boom.
As Ms. Brier expanded her oeuvre from the single note of a Connecticut transplant in New York into the complicated jazz of friendship, especially female friendship, she began getting recognized in restaurants and on sidewalks. Dixie D'Amelio, a princess of the platform, named her account a favorite to follow. The model Emily Ratajkowski used Ms. Brier's voice-over for a video about being "perceived." The playwright Jeremy O. Harris included her in his "Coronavirus Mixtape" posts, carousels of videos and memes Mr. Harris posted during lockdown.
Ms. Brier's viral fame has caught the attention of brands that pay her to write comic bits featuring their products, how she now makes her living. The girl who once made a video about being "the ULTIMATE subway girl" who couldn't swipe her MetroCard is now being hired to sell Subway sandwiches. (Other sponsorships include Bumble, Uno the board game and mirrored cellphone cases.)
But she dreams of having, and show-running, her own television program. In May, she'll perform two nights as her character at Union Hall in Park Slope, Brooklyn -- a neighborhood that character would probably struggle to find. Now represented by Creative Artists Agency, Ms. Brier is auditioning to play other parts as well.
In this town, after all, you still need ambition as well as an algorithm.
"People are like, 'Wow, this is all happening,"' Ms. Brier said. "And I'm like, 'This is just things working out the way I was trying to get them to work out. It's not random."'

YouTube Lifts Ban Put on Trump's Account After Jan. 6: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Google-owned video platform became the latest of the big social networks to reverse the former president's account restrictions.
YouTube suspended former President Donald J. Trump's account on the platform six days after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The video platform said it was concerned that Mr. Trump's lies about the 2020 election could lead to more real-world violence.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, reversed that decision on Friday, permitting Mr. Trump to once again upload videos to the popular site. The move came after similar decisions by Twitter and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.
"We carefully evaluated the continued risk of real-world violence, while balancing the chance for voters to hear equally from major national candidates in the run up to an election," YouTube said on Twitter on Friday. Mr. Trump's account will have to comply with the site's content rules like any other account, YouTube added.
After false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen circulated online and helped stoke the Jan. 6 attack, social media giants suspended Mr. Trump's account privileges. Two years later, the platforms have started to soften their content rules. Under Elon Musk's ownership, Twitter has unwound many of its content moderation efforts. YouTube recently laid off members of its trust and safety team, leaving one person in charge of setting political misinformation policies.
Mr. Trump announced in November that he was seeking a second term as president, setting off deliberations at social media companies over whether to allow him back on their platforms. Days later, Mr. Musk polled Twitter users on whether he should reinstate Mr. Trump, and 52 percent of respondents said yes. Like YouTube, Meta said in January that it was important that people hear what political candidates are saying ahead of an election.
The former president's reinstatement is one of the first significant content decisions that YouTube has taken under its new chief executive, Neal Mohan, who got the top job last month. YouTube also recently loosened its profanity rules so that creators who used swear words at the start of a video could still make money from the content.
YouTube's announcement on Friday echoes a pattern of the company and its parent Google making polarizing content decisions after a competitor has already taken the same action. YouTube followed Meta and Twitter in suspending Mr. Trump after the Capitol attack, and in reversing the bans.
Since losing his bid for re-election in 2020, Mr. Trump has sought to make a success of his own social media service, Truth Social, which is known for its loose content moderation rules.
Mr. Trump on Friday posted on his Facebook page for the first time since his reinstatement. "I'M BACK!" Mr. Trump wrote, alongside a video in which he said, "Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business. Complicated."
Despite his Twitter reinstatement, Mr. Trump has not returned to posting from that account.
In his last tweet, dated Jan. 8, 2021, he said he would not attend the coming inauguration, held at the Capitol.

After TikTok Bans, China Asks for Fair Treatment
China appealed Friday to other governments to treat its companies fairly after Britain and New Zealand joined the United States in restricting use of TikTok due to fears the Chinese-owned video service might be a security risk.
Governments are worried TikTok's owner, ByteDance, might give browsing history or other data about users to China's government or promote propaganda and disinformation.
"We call on the countries concerned to recognize the objective facts, effectively respect the market economy" and provide "a non-discriminatory environment" for all companies, said foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.
In February, the White House told federal agencies to delete TikTok from government-issued mobile devices within 30 days. Congress, the U.S. armed forces and more than half of American state governments prohibit use of the app by their employees.

SOCIAL MEDIA
Meta Users Can Now Pay For a Verified Account
Meta on Friday launched its subscription service in the United States, allowing Facebook and Instagram users to pay for verification in the same vein as Elon Musk-owned Twitter.
The Meta Verified service will give users a blue badge and will cost $ 11.99 per month on the web or $ 14.99 a month on Apple's iOS system and Google-owned Android, Meta said in a statement.
The service is the company's latest effort to diversify its revenue away from advertising.
After a $ 44 billion buyout by Musk last year, Twitter had rolled out its Blue subscription service, which lets people pay for the blue check mark previously limited to verified accounts of politicians and other public figures.
The initial launch of Twitter Blue in November led to a surge in users impersonating celebrities and brands on the platform, which prompted the company to halt the service and reintroduce it with different colored checks for individuals, companies and governments. REUTERS
WORKERS' COMPENSATION
Minimum Wage in Greece
Raised to Pre-Bailout Level
Greece announced on Friday an increase in the minimum wage that will restore pay to levels existing before sweeping cuts were imposed more than a decade ago during an international bailout.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the gross minimum monthly salary will go up on April 1 to 780 euros ( $ 830) from 713 euros.
"I have no illusions. We know that in our country, wages are still low, and they are being squeezed even more by inflation," said Mr. Mitsotakis, whose center-right government faces a general election in the spring.
Greece imposed severe pay cuts in 2012 during bailout programs funded by a European Union rescue fund and the International Monetary Fund.
As the country was on the brink of bankruptcy, the government took control of wage policy and slashed the minimum monthly pay f to 586 euros.

Full text: Twitter didn't move forward with the music licensing deals because of costs, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Twitter explored the licensing of music rights from three major labels before negotiations stalled after Elon Musk's takeover of the company, said eight people with knowledge of the discussions, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Twitter is one of the last big social media platforms without music licensing deals, which allow the sites to host virtually all commercially available audio content without fear of takedowns or legal reprisal. Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have all made agreements for music rights.
Twitter had avoided signing deals for music rights, which require social media companies to compensate rights holders when users post or play content with song. The costs of the licenses can vary, but can be well over $ 100 million a year for established social-media platforms. Twitter has forgone the licensing deals because of the costs, five former employees said.
Twitter and Mr. Musk did not respond to an email request for comment.
Twitter began negotiations with the three major music conglomerates -- Universal, Sony and Warner -- in the fall of 2021, according to six people close to the talks. When Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy the company last April, some music industry leaders saw his involvement as an opportunity to finally get the deals done.
"Twitter uses a significant amount of music but unlike all other mainstream social media platforms has refused to license that music or compensate songwriters," David Israelite, the chief executive of the National Music Publishers' Association, a trade group, tweeted at Mr. Musk that month. "Please help."
For the music companies, licensing agreements with Twitter would not only represent an additional source of revenue but also resolve longstanding problems of copyright infringement on the platform.
After Mr. Musk bought Twitter in October for $ 44 billion, talks continued as he flirted with the idea of challenging TikTok and resurrecting Vine, a once-popular short-video app that Twitter had bought in 2012 but shut down in 2016.
Mr. Musk's team was intrigued by the idea of adding music to the platform, and his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, who has also represented artists including Jay-Z and Megan Thee Stallion, held meetings to understand the status of the label negotiations and assess the costs, four people familiar with the internal discussions said.
Mr. Spiro, who oversaw Twitter's legal portfolio during Mr. Musk's acquisition, left the company in December. He successfully defended Mr. Musk in a Tesla shareholder lawsuit this year.
The internal chaos at Twitter after Mr. Musk's takeover disrupted the negotiations, six people said. The company eliminated some of the people responsible for the music rights talks in several rounds of layoffs, leaving the labels with few remaining Twitter contacts, said four people at the major music companies who were briefed on the discussions.
Mr. Musk's team has also cut hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditures at Twitter -- missing office rent payments, shortchanging software vendors and eliminating a data center -- while requiring that every financial outlay be justified under new budgets. With those mandates, two people said, the company had little means to justify paying tens of millions of dollars to music rights holders.

Lawmaker Pressured to Quit After Misconduct Allegations: [National Desk]

Full text: Assemblyman Juan Ardila did not deny the allegations. He said that his actions were inexcusable and that he would not "debate the facts."
ALBANY, N.Y. -- A New York state lawmaker is facing pressure to resign following accusations from two women of sexual misconduct at a college party in 2015.
Assemblyman Juan Ardila, a first-term Democrat from Queens, was accused of inappropriately touching one woman on a couch while she was heavily intoxicated and of exposing himself to another woman shortly after kissing her in a bathroom on the same night.
The women's claims were first detailed in an article published on Monday by The Queens Chronicle, prompting Mr. Ardila to issue a series of apologies as a growing chorus of elected officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, demanded that he step down.
The woman who accused Mr. Ardila of touching her on the couch without her consent detailed her allegations in an interview with The Times on Thursday. She said the incident occurred in October 2015 during a party at a Manhattan apartment attended by students of Fordham University, from which Mr. Ardila had graduated earlier that year.
The woman, who was a 21-year-old Fordham senior at the time, said she shared her account publicly this week after moving to Long Island City in Queens last month and learning that Mr. Ardila represented a neighboring district.
"I don't know what my place should be aside from telling my story and letting people know who's representing them," said the woman, who is now 28 and requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. "I think they deserve better."
Mr. Ardila, a political newcomer who was elected to the State Assembly in November with support from his party's left wing, did not deny the allegations in a statement on Tuesday. He said that his actions were inexcusable and that he would not "debate the facts."
"I want the public to know that I am deeply apologetic for my past behavior and acknowledge that my actions have caused great harm," he said. "I recognize that this harm was not only to the individuals who came forward, but extends beyond these victims, and impacts survivors everywhere."
Mr. Ardila, who represents parts of Long Island City, Sunnyside and Maspeth, urged his constituents to give him a second chance, saying he was committed to a "restorative justice-centered process."
His office did not reply to multiple requests for comment.
Mr. Ardila's apology, however, did little to quell calls for his resignation from a growing group of Democrats.
On Thursday, Ms. Hochul, who replaced former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in 2021 after he resigned over sexual harassment allegations, said "she supported survivors in their calls for accountability."
"Yes, he should resign," she told reporters in Upper Manhattan following an unrelated public appearance.
Earlier in the week, a group of Queens Democrats had also called on him to resign, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Grace Meng, as well as Donovan Richards, the borough president.
In a joint statement, seven state and local officials in Queens, including Michael Gianaris, the deputy majority leader in the State Senate, said on Wednesday that the women's accounts were "harrowing and reveal indefensible actions -- to which he has admitted."
"While we believe in restorative justice, this process cannot occur while holding a position of power," the statement said.
The powerful speaker of the Assembly, Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, stopped short of calling on Mr. Ardila to resign.
On Wednesday, Mr. Heastie described Mr. Ardila's behavior as "unacceptable" but said that resignation was "a decision that Juan and his constituents have to think about." He added that the lower chamber's ethics committee was limited in its ability to investigate the allegations because they did not take place while Mr. Ardila was a member of the Assembly.
Mr. Ardila, who declined to take questions from reporters in the State Capitol on Wednesday, has not given any indication that he intends to resign.
The woman whom Mr. Ardila touched on the couch said on Thursday that she did not previously know Mr. Ardila and could not recall how they had met that night. She said she had drunk heavily and that she had become intoxicated "past the point of consent" when he began touching her.
"I remember being on the couch with him and him being extremely close to me, and I was kind of confused about why," she said. "It was almost like a person who's in a coma and they're aware of what's going on, but they can't communicate. That's how I started to feel."
Mr. Ardila, she said, later attempted to lead her down a hallway before her best friend saw what was happening and intervened.
The second woman to accuse Mr. Ardila shared her account in a written statement provided to The New York Times by the first woman. She has not made her identity known. She wrote that toward the end of the party, Mr. Ardila pulled her into a bathroom and began kissing her. When she pulled away, she noticed Mr. Ardila had exposed himself and was touching himself, she wrote.
Neither woman reported the incidents to the police. The first woman said she is not considering pressing charges.
Years later, in January 2018, at the height of the MeToo movement, Mr. Ardila messaged the first woman on Instagram to apologize for his behavior, telling her he had been "a jerk," according a screenshot of the message reviewed by The Times.
The woman said she never heard from Mr. Ardila again until she learned last month that he had pursued a career in politics.
Mr. Ardila also came under scrutiny during a failed bid for the City Council in 2021, when he was forced to apologize over a series of offensive Facebook posts from his teenage years that contained racist, misogynistic and homophobic slurs.
Before running for the Legislature, Mr. Ardila worked for the Legal Aid Society, as a consultant to the city's education department, and as a staffer for Brad Lander, the city comptroller, when he served in the City Council.
On Wednesday, Mr. Lander joined other Democrats calling on Mr. Ardila to step down, saying that, "As someone who has seen Juan grow over the past eight years, I hope to see him take accountability now."
Other allies have also begun pulling their support: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she would rescind a previous endorsement of Mr. Ardila by her political action committee, Courage to Change.
The Working Families Party, a left-leaning third party that had backed Mr. Ardila, also called for his resignation, urging Mr. Ardila to "engage in deep reflection in this moment, and recommit to the lifelong work of ending sexual violence."
"The speed at which this story has moved does not allow us to adequately meet the needs of survivors, the person who perpetrated harm, and the community at large," the party said in a statement.

The New Prime Time for TV News: Afternoons

Full text: Enlarge this image.
There’s a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it’s “The Five,” the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama “Yellowstone,” was last year’s most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber’s 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC — the first time in the network’s 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors’ careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that’s changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.
The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus — or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night — America’s news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
“The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now,” said Mosheh Oinounou, a former “CBS Evening News” executive producer. “It’s no different from traditional TV; the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show.”
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans older than 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans older than 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 — the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
“Unless there’s something super compelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch,” said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. “There’s so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ on streaming. It’s hard for the news to compete with Maverick.”
For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few long-standing assumptions.
For one thing, prime-time hosts don’t necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were — and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day’s news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network’s new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing “fresh and unique perspectives to the news,” but it’s also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN’s 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network’s highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot by moving Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks and dismal ratings, Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, “The Lead,” now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN’s evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program “The Rachel Maddow Show” was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC’s prime-time viewership above that of Fox News — the cable news ratings king — in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, political analyst Alex Wagner, has struggled to build an audience. Her ratings in 2023 are tracking about 30% lower than what Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Melber and Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC’s prime-time audience declined 21% from a year prior, and CNN lost 33%.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2% from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, “The Five,” is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, “The Five” leaped past Carlson last year to achieve Fox News’ biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Carlson still outranks “The Five” among adults younger than 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show’s success. “People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is ‘The Five,’” Lachlan Murdoch, CEO of the Fox Corp., said at an investor conference last week. “It’s a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics.”
“The Five” has also incubated two of the network’s rising stars. Fox News turned to Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its straight-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
“The Five” isn’t the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Watters’ 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that for generations summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
“This is what we’ve been seeing for years,” Oinounou said, laughing. “People look for a digest of news as they’re about to eat dinner, and then we’ll send you to more traditional entertainment — written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Student, 21, Is Charged In Assault On Capitol: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Larry Giberson was part of a mob that fought with the police and he cheered on others who used weapons and pepper spray against officers, prosecutors said.
A Princeton University student was charged on Tuesday with being part of a violent mob that assaulted law enforcement officers during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, federal prosecutors said.
The student, Larry F. Giberson Jr., was among a group of rioters who pushed against a phalanx of officers defending the Capitol at a tunnel entrance, according to an affidavit filed by a federal agent. With Mr. Giberson at the front of the crowd as the confrontation unfolded, one officer was briefly crushed between the rioters and the tunnel doors, the affidavit says.
Mr. Giberson, 21, waved other rioters into the tunnel and joined a second round of shoving against the officers, the affidavit says. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to start a chant of "Drag them out!" and cheered on others as they used weapons and pepper spray to attack the police guarding the tunnel, the affidavit says.
Mr. Giberson was charged in a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., with civil disorder, a felony, and several misdemeanors, including engaging in physical violence in a restricted building. He was arrested in Washington and released with conditions after an initial appearance before a federal magistrate judge.
A Princeton University spokesman confirmed that Mr. Giberson, of Manahawkin, N.J., was enrolled as a member of this year's graduating class.
A university website lists Mr. Giberson as a James Madison Program undergraduate fellow for the 2022-23 academic year. The program, the website says, provides "a unique opportunity" for students to "pursue, outside of the classroom, academic interests related to politics, history, law and political thought."
A lawyer for Mr. Giberson, Charles Burnham, declined in a statement to comment "on the truth or falsity of the specific allegations in the complaint while the case remains pending other than to note that even the government agrees Mr. Giberson has been cooperative throughout the investigation."
Mr. Giberson is among about 1,000 people to be charged in connection with the Jan. 6 riot, and one of more than 320 to be accused of assaulting or impeding law enforcement officers as supporters of former President Donald J. Trump stormed the Capitol in a bid to disrupt the certification of President Biden as the winner of the 2020 election.
Mr. Giberson can be seen in publicly available video footage wearing a blue "Make America Great Again" cap on his head and a Trump flag around his neck and climbing toward the tunnel entrance on the Capitol's Lower West Terrace shortly after 3 p.m. the day of the riot, the affidavit says.
Once inside the tunnel, prosecutors said, Mr. Giberson and others tried to force their way in with a coordinated "heave-ho" pushing effort that left one officer crushed between a door and a rioter's shield.
Officers eventually gained temporary control of the tunnel and pushed out rioters, including Mr. Giberson, prosecutors said. As the mob continued its attack, Mr. Giberson stood by and watched as one officer was dragged into the crowd, assaulted and injured, they said.
Federal investigators matched a photo of Mr. Giberson from the day of the riot with images posted on Instagram and the Princeton website, as well as with photos from his high school, the affidavit says.
He was subsequently interviewed at the Princeton Police Department, where he acknowledged being the person seen in videos and photos from the scene of the riot, the affidavit says.
The Daily Princetonian, a student newspaper, reported on Tuesday that Mr. Giberson publicly opposed the university's decision in June 2020 to remove President Woodrow Wilson's name from its public policy school and one of its residential colleges because of what Princeton leaders said were Mr. Wilson's "racist thinking and policies."
"If our university can be intimidated by the transient impulses of the mob mentality to disregard their own esteemed standards," Mr. Giberson wrote in an essay in The Princeton Tory, "what guarantee is there that the university will stand firm against those who would seek to undermine the nation, or indeed, humanity itself?"

After Heartbreak, They Got Creative: [Style Desk]

Full text: It can be difficult to manage all the feelings that comes with heartbreak. You can compartmentalize. Or, you can create.
Sayre Quevedo had reached the end of a five-month affair with a married man when, in the middle of a snowstorm in the winter of 2017, he received a text from his former lover, asking to see him one last time.
This particular whirlwind of a relationship, which they decided together could no longer continue, was very intimate and intense.
"I was like, you know what? OK, fine," Mr. Quevedo, a 30-year-old documentary artist in Brooklyn, recalled in a recent interview. "And he came over and again, I work in documentaries and I record instinctively as part of my practice, and I just remember thinking, like, Oh, I would really like to remember this conversation. I would really like to remember this moment."
To Mr. Quevedo's relief, the man agreed to the unusual request. After not touching the recording for a long time ("I couldn't bring myself to listen to it"), Mr. Quevedo created "Espera," a simple, one-shot documentary backed by audio of their final conversation as a couple, unspooling in real time.
He said he was fascinated by the "intangible parts" of a relationship that are "both permanent and temporary" -- elements that he uses the documentary format to highlight and preserve.
"I think documentary can be a really beautiful way of sort of giving us access to those things," he said, "that disappear so much more quickly than we probably realize, especially as we get older."
So, how to channel romantic heartbreak into your art? Well, there are many ways. Frida Kahlo, after a tumultuous relationship with her husband, the artist Diego Rivera, painted canvas after canvas alluding to their love and complex connection. In the ballad "Song Cry," Jay-Z raps about being unable to show his emotions because of pride. Instead he unpacks his regret and pain over a bad breakup in the song.
Deesha Philyaw, the John and Renée Grisham writer in residence at the University of Mississippi, had resisted writing directly about her own heartbreak for much of her career. But within the last five years, she has begun writing about her second marriage, which ended in divorce.
The end of that marriage was tied to the emotionally fraught relationship she had with her father, she explained.
"I started to see the parallels and I started to write about it in essays, both my relationship with my father and my relationship with my own ex-husband," Ms. Philyaw said in a phone interview. Exploring those similarities helped her come to terms with things, she said.
In her debut short story collection, "The Secret Lives of Church Ladies," the Black women in her pieces are grappling with love, loneliness and longing.
"It showed up in my fiction much earlier because it was just subconscious," Ms. Philyaw said. "Women who are longing, women who are afraid, women who are seeking reciprocity: I have been all those women, those characters."
Last year, Alkebuluan Merriweather, a 25-year-old mixed media artist in Chicago, created the collage "You wanna be outside, I wanna be in a relationship," after a romantic partner decided to have a "hot queer summer."
"It was out of frustration toward the trend of many of the queer relationships I've been in did not last in summertime Chicago because everybody's trying to be outside," Mx. Merriweather said, using a colloquial sense of "outside" to mean actively dating around.
The collage features images sourced from archival databases, old magazines and other places online, including one of the actress Reagan Gomez wearing a black halter top, suggesting a warm day. There's also an image of a Cadillac, something the artist grew up seeing all over the South Side of Chicago, and Black elders playing dominoes juxtaposed with a couple kissing in the corner.
"It felt like a breath of fresh air, but of course I was still in my feelings," said Mx. Merriweather, who posted the piece on Instagram on Valentine's Day.
Pouring feelings from a breakup into art is a tried-and-true practice. It can be a great form of emotional release or healing, and it might even lead to success. (Or as Ariana Grande put it, "God forbid something happens, least this song is a smash.")
According to Mr. Quevedo, documenting these moments allows him to examine the ways he has grown from a relationship. It's not as simple as "one of us or both us being bad people," he said. "There's so many more dimensions." It also allows him to share with others who might relate, he said.
For Dante Acuña, a 31-year-old songwriter and musician who performs as Té, music gave him an outlet to express his feelings when spaces to do so felt limited.
"When I'm talking to other people, when I'm dealing with life, when I'm at work, when I'm with friends and stuff, I'm not sulking most of the time," said Mr. Acuña, who lives in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. "It's just not my nature. If I'm sad, I don't have any place to put that."
Mr. Acuña's music is a mix of hip-hop, neo soul and alternative R&B. He had what he described as his biggest heartbreak in 2012, after the end of a college relationship. He wasn't making much music at the time, he recalled, so he didn't really know how to process what he was feeling.
It wasn't until he started writing and making music seriously, in 2015, that he began facing his emotions. "It just kind of lingered, until honestly when I started making music," he said. "That's when it started healing."
All he writes now are love songs, whether it's romantic love, love for community, lack of love and more. It's a process of getting all the feelings out so that he can move forward.
"I always want to come back to a place of harmony, love, connection, and music can help do that," he said.

NEW YORK — It was a dark Saturday night last month on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Saturday nights can get very dark, but Sabrina Brier, in a rhinestone necklace and strapless plaid pantsuit, was agleam onstage at a basement comedy club called Caveat warming up the crowd.
“You’re the butter, I’m the microwave,” she announced.
That particular joke passed quickly, but the metaphor hung in the air. After some years sweating on the back burner of show business, Brier, 28, has found instant success on the social media platform of the moment, TikTok. She has over 400,000 followers, and many more fans who view, “like” and share her videos, which mostly parody life as a young woman of some privilege and erratic self-confidence vacillating between the excitement of the city and the reassuring comforts of suburbia.
“You see this nook? Perfect for a pumpkin,” she declared in one about reclaiming fall, the supposed favorite season of “basic” white women. “Don’t blame me , blame the architect!”
Brier specializes in point of view, or POV, videos that confront relatable, often hateable characters, with a subtle sneer, gleefully rubbery body and arch delivery of generational catchphrases like “slay, queen” and “I got you,” often repeated for effect. She recently spoofed the Get Ready With Me genre that has women across America smearing makeup on their faces, plugging beauty products and oversharing in equal measure.
POV of that GRWM: “The girl who bullied you in high school is trying to be an influencer.”
In a five-part series on the “Extremely Passive-Aggressive Roommate,” Brier pretends not to care about taking out the trash when it isn’t her day, enforces a rule about not having people over on weeknights, complains about her roomie coming home at 3:27 a.m., strong-arms that roommate into renewing their lease and then welcomes a guest to “the common space.” (The first three videos have each been seen millions of times.) Brier’s real-life roommate, Alice Duchen, an ICU nurse, is often behind the camera, deadpan.
The two women live in Greenwich Village, near a rack of CitiBikes (Brier has also sent up the CitiBike poser who ostentatiously bleats, “on your left!”), in a small two-bedroom walk-up apartment. She’s on a lower floor than the character she plays in one of her most popular videos who breathlessly urges a visitor to ascend six flights of stairs in a building she’s trying to argue is luxury: “It’s going to be so worth it! Come on!”
Eleven days before the Caveat comedy show, Brier sat in her apartment’s dining area before a plate of untouched cookies, under a collection of paintings by her paternal grandmother, and told her origin story.
Her mother, Susan Cinoman, is a playwright currently working on a feminist retelling of the King Arthur legend and who divorced Brier’s father, a cardiologist, when Sabrina was 5.
“Very cordial,” Brier said. “Not any big drama.”
She has an older sister, Gabrielle, now a producer, and they were obsessed with the Disney Channel when little, staging a modern-day “Cinderella” — “except instead of the ball it’s like a Britney Spears concert” — and later “rom-com girlie movies” like “Clueless” and “Mean Girls.”
Brier was in the sixth grade when she first got a phone, the Verizon Chocolate.
“We were the AIM generation,” she said, never dreaming that a phone could one day be a portal to everything. She attended Amity High School, in Connecticut, where she won first place in a Shakespeare competition with a monologue from “The Taming of the Shrew,” not sure comedy was her winning strategy.
“It was such a thing where the boys were the ones who got to have the personality, right? The boys were the class clowns.” She loosened up at Smith College, an all-women’s liberal arts college in Massachusetts, where she majored in theater and took improv classes.
“It was always easy to identify her as someone who was performative,” Cinoman said on the phone. “She wasn’t an extrovert per se, but half of Sabrina was looking out the window at all times. Some other set of realities were impinging on the one that we were all in with her.”
After graduation, Brier worked in talent management for two years, and then got an assistant job in the writers room of “For Life,” an ABC drama about a wrongfully convicted man who becomes a prison lawyer to exonerate himself.
“I am a fiend for anything that makes me cry,” Brier said. “Inside every comedienne is a sad girl, and that’s definitely me.”
After one season, COVID-19 arrived. Restless in quarantine, she began posting videos on Instagram, one of which got picked up by Barstool, the popular sports blog. But this was before Reels.
“It would be kind of blurry, and it wasn’t translating, and I didn’t understand it, and felt old ,” she said. Then she tossed up a few on TikTok, notably one in which she faux-naively referred to Houston Street in New York, which is pronounced How-ston, as Hew-ston. Boom.
As Brier expanded her oeuvre from the single note of a Connecticut transplant in New York into the complicated jazz of friendship, especially female friendship, she began getting recognized in restaurants and on sidewalks.
Dixie D’Amelio, a princess of the platform, named her account a favorite to follow. Model Emily Ratajkowski used Brier’s voice-over for a video about being “perceived.” Playwright Jeremy O. Harris included her in his “Coronavirus Mixtape” posts, carousels of videos and memes Harris posted during lockdown.
Brier’s viral fame has caught the attention of brands that pay her to write comic bits featuring their products, how she now makes her living. The girl who once made a video about being “the ULTIMATE subway girl” who couldn’t swipe her MetroCard is now being hired to sell Subway sandwiches. (Other sponsorships include Bumble; Uno, the game; and mirrored cellphone cases.)
But she dreams of having, and running, her own television program. In May, she’ll perform two nights as her character at Union Hall in Park Slope — a Brooklyn neighborhood that character would probably struggle to find. Now represented by Creative Artists Agency, Brier is auditioning for other parts as well.
In this town, after all, you still need ambition as well as an algorithm.
“People are like, ‘Wow, this is all happening,’” Brier said. “And I’m like, ‘This is just things working out the way I was trying to get them to work out. It’s not random.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Alcaraz Is Back, To the Delight Of a Tournament: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The 2022 U.S. Open champion, Alcaraz battled injuries in fall and winter. At Indian Wells, he is nearly at full power, dominating opponents and dazzling fans.
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. -- It's a pretty easygoing crowd at the BNP Paribas Open in the heart of the Coachella Valley.
Spectators soak up the sun. They wander the grounds while gazing at the mountains. They drink cheap beer priced expensively. Sometimes they watch tennis. Often they don't.
And then Saturday night rolled around, and just about every seat in Stadium 1 was occupied on a breezy night in the desert that was chilly enough for puffer jackets.
Carlos Alcaraz was in the house, tender hamstring and all, trying to deliver this tournament -- and really the sport itself -- the kind of juice that only he seems able to deliver these days, especially with Rafael Nadal sidelined with an injury and Novak Djokovic prohibited from entering the United States because of his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19.
To do that, though, Alcaraz, the 19-year-old Spanish star, needs to be on the court, and that has not happened much since he blasted his way to his first Grand Slam title and the No. 1 ranking at the U.S. Open in New York last September.
That effort required a series of marathon matches, including one that lasted until nearly 3 in the morning. He has been mostly hobbling ever since. He battled an abdominal injury through the fall. Then, in his final practice before his scheduled journey to the Australian Open, he pulled a hamstring as he sprinted and stretched to reach a short ball.
Alcaraz, whose foot-on-the-gas style may make him more prone to injuries, like his compatriot Nadal, returned to play two small tournaments last month in South America. He won the title in Buenos Aires. Then, in Rio de Janeiro, he made the final but aggravated his hamstring midway through his three-set loss to Cameron Norrie of Britain. He pulled out of his next tournament, in Acapulco, to rest for Indian Wells, where tournament organizers fretting over the loss of Nadal and Djokovic were praying that Alcaraz could recover in time.
"The tennis insiders knew that there was this new kid, maybe the next Rafa," Tommy Haas, the German former pro who is the tournament director here, said of Alcaraz in the tense days before the start of the tournament. "And all of a sudden he just has a blowout year and becomes the youngest No. 1 of all time and you go, 'How is this possible, and how amazing is he to watch?"'
There are a handful of players that can make an early-round match feel like a big event, and Alcaraz did so on Saturday night as he ambushed Thanasi Kokkinakis of Australia and won in straight sets.
Iga Swiatek of Poland, the women's No. 1, had played in the afternoon in a mostly empty stadium. Taylor Fritz, the defending champion and top American, and Ben Shelton, also an American and the young season's brightest surprise, then dueled in a tight, three-set battle that filled a good majority of the Stadium 1 seats. But it was nothing compared with the packed crowd that Alcaraz drew for the night's final match.
Even Jimmy Connors, who knows something about putting on a show, stuck around, sitting high in the stadium in the media seats. Alcaraz was at it again on Monday night, playing in the headliner's spot -- albeit in front of a thinner, school night crowd -- against Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands. The basketball great and tennis obsessive Dirk Nowitzki was courtside.
There is that crackling forehand that sounds different from everyone else's, more like an ax splitting a log than polyester strings thumping a fuzzy ball. There are all the desperate sprints after nearly out-of-reach balls that so many players ignore. He has the most delicate and deceptive drop shot and stinging volleys.
When a willowy drop shot clipped the tape and trickled just over the sideline, he twisted in anguish. How dare the gravity and subtle currents of the desert air conspire to interfere with his attempts at perfection.
"I try to make the people enjoy watching tennis," Alcaraz said after his first win. "And I think the way that I play, they love it."
He will play Jack Draper of Britain in the round of 16 Tuesday evening.
The game wears on many younger players. The pressure of expectations, the constant attention and the relentless schedule have toppled top talents, either temporarily, in the case of Nick Kyrgios, or permanently. A year ago, Ashleigh Barty retired as the world No. 1 at 25.
There are also players a few years older than Alcaraz who have flirted with his level, or achieved it, only to fall back before fans could get on the bandwagon.
Daniil Medvedev won the U.S. Open in 2021 and rose to the top spot in the rankings early last year but won just two minor titles. At the moment, he is on a 16-match winning streak. Stefanos Tsitsipas has made two Grand Slam finals, but nerves and Djokovic got the better of him both times.
As for the players who are of Alcaraz's vintage, they know his early success has set a standard that will be hard to match.
"I will try," Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, who is 21 and grew up playing in junior tournaments with Alcaraz, said unconvincingly with a shake of his head after his second-round loss here over the weekend.
So far, Alcaraz has seemed immune to the usual anxieties. His approach?
"Live the moment, play the match, and go for it," he said.
Alcaraz has had some help this week in producing the kind of buzz the sport is always seeking. Emma Raducanu of England, who won the 2021 U.S. Open as a qualifier, has gone on a roll, winning three consecutive matches for just the second time since her breakout Grand Slam win.
The success has come largely out of nowhere. Raducanu, who last month deleted Instagram from her phone to better focus on herself, has been battling injuries and illnesses, most recently a wrist problem. She hardly prepared for this tournament and didn't practice for four days ahead of her first match.
But on Monday afternoon against Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil, the 13th seed, Raducanu was once more whipping her lethal forehands into the corners and rolling her windmill backhand with a freedom that had been largely absent for the past year. And she was doing it in front of a raucous field-court crowd, just like in the not-so-old days of the 2021 U.S. Open. She was scheduled to play Swiatek on Tuesday in a matchup between the two most recent U.S. Open champions.
"I did a really good job mentally of just staying, you know, keep hitting through the shots and trying to be committing to everything, even when it's tight," she said after her three-set win.
In other words, what the player everyone now calls Carlito plans to do on Tuesday night against Draper, who at 21 may be a rival for long time.
"I'm going to enjoy it," Alcaraz said.
More than likely, so will pretty much everyone watching.

Even a City Councilman Learns It's Hard to Find A New York Apartment: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chi Ossé called his unsuccessful search for a new home "tiring, treacherous, and competitive." To many New Yorkers, his experience is relatable.
In 2021, Chi Ossé, 24, a former Manhattan party promoter and activist against police brutality, pulled off an impressive win to become the youngest member of the New York City Council. Now, he faces a new test: moving out of his mother's townhouse and finding an apartment.
Over the past two months, in between City Council meetings and conversations with constituents, Mr. Ossé, a Democrat, has hunted for a suitable one-bedroom apartment within his district, which includes parts of the Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods in Brooklyn. But, as he recently complained on Twitter, the futile search -- he has seen almost 20 places so far and applied to about five -- has been "tiring, treacherous, and competitive."
Sometimes, Mr. Ossé said, he has been outfoxed by people moving faster than him. In other cases, he said apartments had floor damage or water damage or were still in the process of being renovated. Or there was a washer and no dryer.
"Some of these apartments are like someone told an alien to draw their idea of what an apartment is," he said. "They'll have the fridge in the living room."
Mr. Ossé is the son of a prominent hip-hop lawyer and podcaster, Reggie Ossé, better known as Combat Jack, who died in 2017. Mr. Ossé acknowledges his privileges. As a city councilman, he earns close to $ 150,000 a year, more than double New York City's median household income, meaning he does not have to make difficult choices between eating, keeping the lights on and paying his rent. He has a safe, stable place to live as he searches.
That the hunt has been frustrating despite all those advantages reflects the depths of New York City's housing crisis. The median monthly rent for new leases in Brooklyn was $ 3,400 in February, according to the brokerage firm Douglas Elliman, up nearly 10 percent from almost $ 3,100 in February 2020.
Mr. Ossé said housing was the top issue among his constituents. Many are grappling with double-digit rent increases, and others feel as if they are being priced out of their neighborhoods. Last year, Mr. Ossé and a handful of other council members voted against a city budget agreement negotiated with Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, in part because it did not invest enough in affordable housing.
Mr. Ossé said he began his search about two months ago. His brother and his brother's girlfriend were moving into the townhouse with his mother. Mr. Ossé felt it was time to leave and find his first place so he could have some more space and privacy. (His mother, he said, wants him to stay.)
He began by searching the listing site StreetEasy for a one-bedroom apartment that would rent for $ 1,500 to $ 2,000. He quickly realized he was "delusional," he said. He adjusted the price range upward to $ 2,500. Even then, he could find only a handful of apartments that were of decent quality and in his district.
"And those five would be off the market in 48 hours," he said.
He raised his limit to $ 3,000. He started contacting friends to find out if they knew of any available places. He followed brokers on social media. He also began to wonder if, because he was a councilman, landlords were avoiding renting to him because they were not fully complying with city rules.
Over a recent weekend, he saw a place on Halsey Street and Lewis Avenue. He thought he connected with the landlord, who worked in politics and attended the same high school as Mr. Ossé.
"Monday came by and I didn't hear from him," Mr. Ossé said.
His exasperation prompted his post on Twitter last week, which also took aim at broker's fees -- one-time charges that can run thousands of dollars. He may draft a bill that requires landlords to share the cost of the broker's fee when renters find an apartment themselves.
He said his search had also sharpened his understanding of the city's housing crisis, which he attributed to a housing shortage decades in the making. His district is one of the most rapidly gentrifying parts of the city. Mr. Ossé said developers should include more homes that rent below market rates, especially in neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights.
Many developers and landlords say regulations, taxes and the cost of land drive up the cost of operating a building, making it all but impossible to charge below-market rents and keep a building solvent. The mayor and other city officials have argued that imposing too many conditions on new development could force builders to abandon projects entirely and worsen the housing crisis.
Mr. Ossé's search, however, may be nearing an end. On Saturday, after seeing a two-bedroom apartment listed at close to $ 3,000 a month, he walked to an older building.
He had found the broker, Omar Thomas, on Instagram. He liked the apartment's older style of wood floors and crown molding, which contrasted with some of the newer buildings he had seen. The monthly rent, $ 2,250, was also attractive, even though he would have to pay a broker's fee.
On Monday, he applied.
"I am hopeful," he said. "But the last time I was hopeful was last weekend. I'm really not trying to get my hopes too high."

Full text: It would be the tech company's second round of cuts since November. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has declared 2023 the "year of efficiency."
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a "year of efficiency."
The layoffs will affect Meta's recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company's website. The announcement is the company's second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta's hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.
"This will be tough and there's no way around that," he wrote.
Meta's stock rose more than 7 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday.
Mr. Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or "managers managing managers." He said he took responsibility for last year's layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta's layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple's privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta's ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta's data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a "metaverse" company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Mr. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it's unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in A.I. for years but lately has not been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Mr. Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday's announcement of layoffs -- especially in the recruiting division -- felt "gut-punched," according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
"People are entering a job market that is the worst I've ever seen," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta's cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
"There's a lot of uncertainty," Ms. Sumner said. "There's a lot of anger, and there's the question many folks are asking: 'How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?"'
In his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Mr. Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Mr. Zuckerberg's crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange.
In his note, Mr. Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
"The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew and our growth slowed considerably," he said. "We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years."

Lincoln Center, the Land Of New Dining Options: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Dining out near the arts complex has never been more exciting.
If the new dining scene at Rockefeller Center was the restaurant event of 2022, something slightly smaller but no less exciting is playing out at Lincoln Center. Last summer, I addressed a reader question about where to dine near the arts complex and found myself struggling to find pre-ballet-opera-Philharmonic options that were on the newer side.
In just four short months, that has become a nonissue.
Dinner Without Leaving Geffen Hall
Let's start with Tatiana, the first New York City restaurant from the chef and reality television star Kwame Onwuachi. It sprang up in the lobby of the newly renovated David Geffen Hall a few weeks before Thanksgiving, promising cheffed-up takes on African-diaspora favorites like Jamaican patties and braised oxtails.
I stopped by the dimly lit restaurant soon after it opened for a quick bite before taking in "Jurassic Park" -- for the first time, if you can believe it -- shown with a live orchestra. The food was all-in-all delightful and creative, and this week Pete Wells, awarding the restaurant three stars, wrote that it "gives us food from cultures that are part of Mr. Onwuachi's world but that weren't usually on display at Lincoln Center, to put it mildly." Tatiana also serves a small late-night menu (and its tip-top cocktails) from 10 to 11 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays, for any post-performance hunger pangs.
If you can't get a seat at Tatiana -- an unavoidable post-review woe -- consider Bad Roman, the latest restaurant from the Quality Branded group. You have to take two escalators to reach this clubby restaurant inside the Shops at Columbus Circle, but once you're inside, you'll quickly forget you're dining at the mall. (You will unfortunately be reminded when you leave; as one of my dining companions said, "I can't believe Per Se is also here.")
Bad Roman is ... not bad! There are some misses -- do not under any circumstances order the "reverse affogato," a cloudy mess of milk-washed vodka and coffee granita -- but do order the crispy pepperoni cups with ranch dressing and fresh basil, the spicy gem Caesar, the grilled pork shoulder, the truly excellent penne luongo alla Gricia and the lemon cheesecake, which is a credit to both cheesecakes and desserts in general.
A Pre-Show Seafood Tour
So Tatiana and Bad Roman are slammed. Luckily for you, one of Columbus Circle's best-kept secrets, at least for now, is El Fish Marisqueria, the latest restaurant from the chef Julian Medina and the restaurateur Louis Skibar, best-known for their theater district and Upper West Side favorite, Toloache. At West 67th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, El Fish is close enough to Lincoln Center to keep you from arriving late to the Met and being sent to opera jail, or as the Met's tardiness policy calls it, "List Hall."
Unsurprisingly, seafood is the star player at El Fish, though there are options like pollo a la plancha and Caesar salad. This Medina project is quiet, intimate and the service is top-notch. Start with the lobster aguachile, its tender pieces of lobster arranged in a circle over a bed of rich peanut butter-yuzu sauce. Split the pescadillas Acapulco, two corn tortillas stuffed with a hearty fish hash and topped with super-ripe avocado. Make your own pan-fried lobster tacos with the langosta Ensenada and close the show with ice cream and a warm churro. (Throw in a couple of watermelon margaritas along the way.)
Finally, sidle up to whatever show you're taking in that evening and let the undeniable beauty of the finest fine arts -- and a great meal -- swallow you whole.
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviewed Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi, which he says "sets itself apart with its New York focus and New York style."
Openings: The Midtown townhouse that was once home to Lidia Bastianich's Felidia will become Anto, a new Korean fine-dining restaurant on March 22; Wylie Dusfresne of ~wd50 fame will open Stretch Pizza in collaboration with Breads Bakery on Friday; and a new Cambodian restaurant, Lula Mae, arrives in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
Guess who's back? Angel's Share, the beloved cocktail bar, will rise again in a new location, 45 Grove Street, Robert Simonson reports. It will be under the ownership of Erina Yoshida, the daughter of the original owner, Tony Yoshida.
This week, Eric Asimov wrote in praise of winemakers who aren't focused on producing the world's best Riesling or the most noteworthy Cabernet, but "the best possible wine from the place where the grapes are grown."
Brett Anderson wrote about the enduring interest in "Top Chef," entering its 20th season, as both a reality television show and a barometer of America's obsession with food television.
There's nothing sad about leftovers, especially not with the growing number of cookbooks, including a new one from Tamar Adler, dedicated to no-waste cooking, Tejal Rao writes.

Dick Fosbury, 76, Jumper Whose 'Flop' Flipped His Sport on Its Head: [Biography]

Author: Traub, Alex

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His back-first, neck-down leaping style struck many as a novelty act. After he won Olympic gold in 1968, it came to dominate his sport.
Dick Fosbury, a gangly civil engineering student who shocked his peers, delighted sports fans and started a revolution in competitive high jumping with his backward leaps, died on Sunday at a nursing facility in Salt Lake City. He was 76.
The cause was lymphoma, a spokesman announced on Instagram.
Fosbury's claim to fame was a signature jumping style: the "Fosbury Flop." With a running start at a raised bar, he launched himself back first, seemed to hover for a moment parallel with the ground, and landed approximately on the back of his neck.
The technique has been compared to a corpse being pushed out of a window. Like Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling, Fosbury's flopping struck many onlookers as residing somewhere between a physical feat and a joke. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, the crowd oohed, aahed and laughed watching Fosbury compete.
But the last laugh was his:
The high-jump bar kept being raised, and Fosbury kept clearing it. He finally executed a Fosbury Flop at 7 feet 4¼ inches -- earning him not just the gold medal, but an Olympic record at the time.
"Even Fearless Fosbury is amazed," The New York Times reported after his victory. "'Sometimes I see movies,' he says, 'and I really wonder how I do it."'
Within a few years, the Fosbury Flop was the standard method of elite high jumping. (The current Olympic record is held by Charles Austin, who Fosbury Flopped 7 feet 10 inches at the 1996 games in Atlanta.)
More broadly, the Flop set a standard for the kind of innovation that can transform a human endeavor. The Times has written about "the Dick Fosbury of ski jumping," of racewalking, of golf, of angler fishing and of the game show "Jeopardy!" When Piaget introduced a line of watches advertised as a "daring departure," the company made Fosbury its spokesman.
Richard Douglas Fosbury was born in Portland, Ore., on March 6, 1947. His father, Doug, drove a logging truck, and his mother, Helen (Childers) Fosbury, was a concert pianist and secretary. He grew up in Medford, in southern Oregon.
In later years he often said that at the start of his high-jump career, in high school, he was the worst jumper in his school, in the school's conference and in all of Oregon. He was seemingly not even a gifted athlete, having failed to make his school's football and basketball teams.
In the high jump, he initially used the old-fashioned scissors style, in which the athlete runs at the bar and hurtles over in a roughly sitting-up position, kicking one leg after the other over the bar.
One day, Fosbury felt inclined to experiment with a new method: trying to clear the bars with his hips. The Flop began coming to him naturally. Coaches were not so sure: They would check the rule books to make sure it was legal, warn him that he could hurt himself doing it or simply assert that it was not a winning strategy.
Fosbury ignored the advice. He improved his personal best by an entire foot in high school alone. He began training harder and discovering a new joy in the sport.
"When you reached the elite level in the high jump, going over the bar at those high levels, you really feel like you're flying," he told The Times in 2002. "You're up there for only a second, but time really does begin to slow down. Time expands. The mind does amazing things. And at that level, it's truly 90 percent mental and 10 percent physical."
It was not just Fosbury's form that made him an unconventional athlete. He wore mismatched running shoes. He had the arm muscles of a chess player. Before making an approach run, he rocked back and forth, clenching and unclenching his fists.
He graduated from Oregon State University in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. He moved to Idaho, where he founded an engineering company. His jobs included designing and building bike trails and running paths. He ultimately became a county commissioner in Blaine County, Idaho.
He also stayed involved in sports, serving as a vice president of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Association and teaching the high jump around the world.
He took swing dancing classes with a woman named Robin Tomasi. She became his wife, and they grew hay and cared for horses on a farm near the town of Bellevue in southern Idaho. He was in Salt Lake City to be treated for his lymphoma.
Fosbury's survivors include his wife; his sister, Gail Fosbury; his son, Erich; his stepdaughters, Stephanie Thomas-Phipps and Kristin Thompson; and several grandchildren.
Even after his Olympic victory, it still seemed possible that the Fosbury Flop was a novelty act and that other techniques, like the straddle, might prove superior in the end.
"I think quite a few kids will begin trying it my way now," Fosbury told The Times in 1968. "I don't guarantee results, and I don't recommend my style to anyone. All I say is, If a kid can't straddle, he can try it my way."

Princeton Student Charged With Attacking Officers During Jan. 6 Riot

A Princeton University student was charged on Tuesday with being part of a violent mob that assaulted law enforcement officers during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, federal prosecutors said.
The student, Larry F. Giberson Jr., was among a group of rioters who pushed against a phalanx of officers defending the Capitol at a tunnel entrance, according to an affidavit filed by a federal agent. With Giberson at the front of the crowd as the confrontation unfolded, one officer was briefly crushed between the rioters and the tunnel doors, the affidavit says.
Giberson, 21, waved other rioters into the tunnel and joined a second round of shoving against the officers, the affidavit says. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to start a chant of “Drag them out!” and cheered on others as they used weapons and pepper spray to attack the police guarding the tunnel, the affidavit says.
Giberson was charged in a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., with civil disorder, a felony, and several misdemeanors, including engaging in physical violence in a restricted building. He was arrested in Washington and released with conditions after an initial appearance before a federal magistrate judge.
A Princeton University spokesperson confirmed that Giberson, of Manahawkin, New Jersey, was enrolled as a member of this year’s graduating class.
A university website lists Giberson as a James Madison Program undergraduate fellow for the 2022-23 academic year. The program, the website says, provides “a unique opportunity” for students to “pursue, outside of the classroom, academic interests related to politics, history, law and political thought.” Giberson could not be reached for comment. A lawyer representing him did not respond to a request for comment.
Giberson is among about 1,000 people to be charged in connection with the Jan. 6 riot, and one of more than 320 to be accused of assaulting or impeding law enforcement officers as supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in a bid to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election.
Giberson can be seen in publicly available video footage wearing a blue “Make America Great Again” cap on his head and a Trump flag around his neck and climbing toward the tunnel entrance on the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace shortly after 3 p.m. the day of the riot, the affidavit says.
Once inside the tunnel, prosecutors said, Giberson and others tried to force their way in with a coordinated “heave-ho” pushing effort that left one officer crushed between a door and a rioter’s shield.
Officers eventually gained temporary control of the tunnel and pushed out rioters, including Giberson, prosecutors said. As the mob continued its attack, Giberson stood by and watched as one officer was dragged into the crowd, assaulted and injured, they said.
Federal investigators matched a photo of Giberson from the day of the riot with images posted on Instagram and the Princeton website, as well as with photos from his high school, the affidavit says.
He was subsequently interviewed at the Princeton Police Department, where he acknowledged being the person seen in videos and photos from the scene of the riot, the affidavit says.
The Daily Princetonian, a student newspaper, reported on Tuesday that Giberson publicly opposed the university’s decision in June 2020 to remove President Woodrow Wilson’s name from its public policy school and one of its residential colleges because of what Princeton leaders said were Wilson’s “racist thinking and policies.”
“If our university can be intimidated by the transient impulses of the mob mentality to disregard their own esteemed standards,” Giberson wrote in an essay in The Princeton Tory, “what guarantee is there that the university will stand firm against those who would seek to undermine the nation, or indeed, humanity itself?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Meta to Lay Off 10,000 More Workers

SAN FRANCISCO — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13% of its workforce, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”
The layoffs will affect Meta’s recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13% of its workforce at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing in March 2022.
“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.
Meta’s stock rose more than 7% by the close of trading Tuesday.
Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the CEO said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or “managers managing managers.” He said he took responsibility for last year’s layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta’s layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple’s privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta’s ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta’s data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a “metaverse” company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it’s unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in AI for years but has not lately been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday’s announcement of layoffs — especially in the recruiting division — felt “gut-punched,” according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
“People are entering a job market that is the worst I’ve ever seen,” said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta’s cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Sumner said. “There’s a lot of anger, and there’s the question many folks are asking: ‘How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?’”
In his announcement Tuesday, Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Zuckerberg’s crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
In his note, Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
“The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably,” he said. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.”

SAN FRANCISCO — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13% of its workforce, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”
The layoffs will affect its recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The new announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13% of its workforce at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing in March 2022.
“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.
Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also include WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or “managers managing managers.” He said he took responsibility for last year’s layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta is dealing with many challenges these days. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple’s privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta’s ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a “metaverse” company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it’s unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in AI for years but has not lately been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
In his announcement Tuesday, Zuckerberg laid out a new vision to streamline the company’s organization, including removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering. He added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.

Academy Awards Draws 18.7 Million Viewers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The viewership rose a second consecutive year, but was still the third-least-watched Oscars on record.
ABC executives and much of Hollywood can breathe a sigh of relief.
Viewership totals for ABC's telecast of the 95th Academy Awards on Sunday night rose for a second consecutive year, drawing 18.7 million people, according to Nielsen.
Even so, it was the third-least-watched Oscars on record. The standards for success in awards show ratings have been scrambled in recent years, however, as viewers increasingly turn away from much of live television in favor of on-demand streaming entertainment.
Only 10.4 million people watched the pared-down pandemic edition of the Oscars in 2021, setting off alarm bells within ABC and the entire entertainment industry. Last year's Oscars attracted 16.6 million, with viewership swelling after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock onstage. Before 2018, the telecast had never dropped below 32 million.
Sunday's Oscars had a few things going for it. Superstars like Rihanna and Lady Gaga performed nominated songs. Two films up for best picture grossed more than $ 1 billion at the box office -- "Top Gun: Maverick" collected $ 1.5 billion, and "Avatar: The Way of Water" took in $ 2.3 billion. And the best picture winner, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," generated $ 104 million in ticket sales. Viewership tends to increase when popular films are nominated.
In the run-up to Sunday's ceremony, the academy tapped new marketing partners like Letterboxd, a social media site for movie fans (with 8.4 million members, most of them ages 18 to 34), and increased its promotional efforts on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.
Viewership among adults under 50 grew by 5 percent when compared with last year's Oscars, according to Nielsen.
The ceremony was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, and might have been notable for the simplest thing: avoiding controversy. Reviews were mixed, with some critics praising the show's traditional look and feel, and others being turned off by what Mike Hale described in The New York Times as a "promotional, exhortatory, shrink-wrapped" ceremony.
The evening had plenty of tears, with all four acting winners (Brendan Fraser, Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis) giving emotionally charged speeches. In a change, most of the winners avoided soliloquies about politics, aspects of speeches that academy research has shown make people grab the remote.
Several pieces of data now point to a live events ratings turnaround this year. The Grammy Awards rebounded to 12.5 million viewers this year, up from 9.6 million last year. And last month the Super Bowl drew 113 million viewers, the second-highest viewership total in the game's history.
As recently as two years ago, the Oscars seemed vulnerable to losing its long-ranking status as the most-watched entertainment program in American television. Its position had became so weak that HBO programmed the finale of its hugely popular freshman drama, "The Last of Us," opposite the Oscars on Sunday night. (When "The Last of Us" went head-to-head against the Super Bowl last month, network executives released that week's episode on a Friday on HBO Max; the network did not bother deploying that get-out-in-front-of-it strategy for the Oscars.) HBO said on Monday that the finale drew a season high of 8.2 million viewers.
ABC has the broadcast rights to the Oscars through 2028, and the network provides the academy with roughly 80 percent of its annual revenue. The academy reported that the 2022 Oscars generated $ 137.1 million, almost all of it coming from Disney, ABC's parent company, for the domestic and international licensing rights.
ABC said on Friday that it had sold out its Oscars inventory; Pfizer, Rolex and Verizon were the lead sponsors. The network did not divulge its prices, but advertising buyers said ABC had charged between $ 1.6 million and $ 2.1 million for a 30-second spot, down slightly from the previous year.
And as ratings have slumped, ABC has increased the number of ads it places in the Oscars telecast. Last year, it collected about $ 139 million across 70 commercials, according to Vivvix, which tracks ad spending. In 2021, ABC pulled in $ 129 million across 56 ads. The red carpet preshow brings in roughly $ 16 million annually.

Drum-and-Bass Is Rising Again, With Nia Archives in the Spotlight

LONDON — About 300 dance music fans were packed into a north London club late last year, waiting for Nia Archives, a jungle artist and DJ, to begin her set.
Jungle and its successor drum-and-bass emerged in Britain in the 1990s, and club nights dedicated to these styles of dance music can often attract older crowds dominated by men looking to hear the relentlessly rhythmic sounds of their youth. But this evening was different: Young women were front and center in the crowd.
As Archives, 23, sang over her own soulful tracks or dropped frantic remixes of rap hits with rumbling bass lines, groups of men tried to barge their way forward, but the women stuck out their elbows, held the men back and kept on dancing.
Casey Forbes, 19, felt she “had to” stay at the front, she said afterward. “I’m a big fan of jungle music,” she added, “but there’s not much women playing, especially Black women, so seeing her onstage and performing her own music, she’s a big inspiration.”
Behind her decks, Archives danced from side to side, her nails painted in the colors of the Jamaican flag, her long braids flying around her.
Jungle and drum-and-bass have been two of Britain’s most popular forms of dance music for nearly 30 years, and many of their pioneers are now middle-aged. Britain’s music press regularly proclaims a new act or two is revitalizing, or even “saving,” the genres. In recent years, a host of female artists, many of whom are Black, have been identified as the music’s next big things, including DJ and producer Sherelle and singer and producer PinkPantheress, who regularly uses drum-and-bass beats in her songs.
Archives, whose music combines clattering beats with emotional vocals, is the latest with breakout buzz. In January, she took third place in the BBC’s Sound of 2023, a long-running annual poll that has previously tipped Billie Eilish, Wet Leg and Adele for success. That accolade came just weeks after Archives won best electronic dance act at Britain’s Music of Black Origin (MOBO) awards, and followed a summer spent DJ’ing at major festivals such as Glastonbury.
Her third EP, “Sunrise Bang Ur Head Against Tha Wall,” released Friday, follows “Headz Gone West” from 2021, which she recorded in her bedroom studio, and “Forbidden Feelingz,” from last year, which opens with “Ode 2 Maya Angelou,” a track that blends stuttering breakbeats with the writer’s “Still I Rise.”
Speaking on a recent call from Los Angeles, Archives — who declined to give her real name — said the new EP was an attempt to experiment with different sounds and meld jungle with other genres “whilst still being true to what I do.”
The release includes “So Tell Me …,” which features indie guitars and glossy strings alongside clattering drums; “That’s Tha Way Life Goes,” a track she said was inspired by an obsession with bossa nova; and “Baianá,” an uproarious instrumental with vocals sampled from an old Brazilian record and a decades-old interview with DJ Patife, one of that country’s main drum-and-bass stars.
In an earlier video call, Archives said she has been inspired by female predecessors in British dance music, including DJ Flight and DJ Storm. “It’s representation,” she added. “It’s really important to see yourself in music.”
When she used to go to parties as a teenager, she said, she would sometimes see men nod toward her then remark to their friends, “You don’t see Black girls in raves like this.” Today, Archives observed, women feel “comfortable to just be themselves and have fun.”
That shift has been noticed by Natalie Wright, who began performing as DJ Flight more than 25 years ago. Wright said that in the 1990s, she was “so tunnel vision and passionate” about wanting to make it as a drum-and-bass DJ, she didn’t let sexist comments or the lack of women stars bother her “until quite a bit later.” In 2018, she co-founded EQ50, an organization to encourage gender diversity in drum-and-bass music.
Two years later, it launched a mentoring program for women and nonbinary artists; Archives was accepted from among 80 applicants.
Wright said Archives immediately stood out because she was able “to do everything” — from producing great beats to writing grabby hooks. Archives also had “that slightly different charisma” that seemed necessary for stardom, she added.
Another of Archives’ favorite artists has become a fan: Jayne Conneely, better known as DJ Storm, said Archives is “like a little sponge” always looking to learn from older stars: “She’s a force to be reckoned with.”
Growing up in Leeds, a city in northern England, Archives said she was surrounded by music from a young age — hearing gospel at her local Jamaican Pentecostal church, rap at home and drum-and-bass at carnivals.
At 16, she left a difficult home life and moved to Manchester, where she began to write music. “I’d been through a really turbulent time,” she said, “and I had no way to process how I was feeling, so that was what I used.” Soon, she was crafting tracks such as “Crossroads,” which she has said was about her relationship with her mother. (“Tell me, who do I turn to?” she sings. “I used to trust you, but you said things that were untrue.”)
She initially sang over rap beats, but she found the songs sounded too sad. Eventually, she sped the music up to “disguise the emotions I’m actually feeling with these crazy jungle drums,” she said. That formula clicked.
During the height of the pandemic, Archives spent 500 pounds (a little more than $600) of a student loan on Instagram ads to promote her debut single, “Sober Feels.” Its hook — “I don’t like how sober feels” — seemed to resonate with Britons who couldn’t party during the country’s lockdowns, she said. A month later, Spotify was adding another of her tracks to its New Music Friday U.K. playlist. “That’s when I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, OK, things can start happening really,’” she added, stunned that her bedroom music could travel so far.
Although her songs are finding wider audiences, Archives said she said she is still writing to process her own emotions. One track on the new EP, “Conveniency,” is about an unrequited love over the past year, she said, while “So Tell Me …” is about her seven-year estrangement from her mother.
Estrangement is a topic she felt compelled to tackle to give hope to others who come from challenging home environments. “I don’t have a mom or a dad, and for someone my age, it’s really hard to navigate adulthood and being a women without anyone to show you how to do that,” she said.
A future debut album would also involve more musical experimentation, she said. Her call from Los Angeles came during a two-week recording trip that included writing sessions with singer and violinist Sudan Archives, rapper and producer Jpegmafia, and producer DJ Dahi. She was “just trying to make something new and fun,” she said, but she insisted her work would have jungle music at its core.
She needed to “be true to what I do,” she said: “My drums are my identity.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Fake Videos Just Got Easier For Everyone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Meme-makers and misinformation peddlers are embracing artificial intelligence tools to create convincing fake videos on the cheap.
It wouldn't be completely out of character for Joe Rogan, the comedian turned podcaster, to endorse a "libido-boosting" coffee brand for men.
But when a video circulating on TikTok recently showed Mr. Rogan and his guest, Andrew Huberman, hawking the coffee, some eagle-eyed viewers were shocked -- including Dr. Huberman.
"Yep that's fake," Dr. Huberman wrote on Twitter after seeing the ad, in which he appears to praise the coffee's testosterone-boosting potential, even though he never did.
The ad was one of a growing number of fake videos on social media made with technology powered by artificial intelligence. Experts said Mr. Rogan's voice appeared to have been synthesized using A.I. tools that mimic celebrity voices. Dr. Huberman's comments were ripped from an unrelated interview.
Making realistic fake videos, often called deepfakes, once required elaborate software to put one person's face onto another's. But now, many of the tools to create them are available to everyday consumers -- even on smartphone apps, and often for little to no money.
The new altered videos -- mostly, so far, the work of meme-makers and marketers -- have gone viral on social media sites like TikTok and Twitter. The content they produce, sometimes called cheapfakes by researchers, work by cloning celebrity voices, altering mouth movements to match alternative audio and writing persuasive dialogue.
The videos, and the accessible technology behind them, have some A.I. researchers fretting about their dangers, and have raised fresh concerns over whether social media companies are prepared to moderate the growing digital fakery.
Disinformation watchdogs are also steeling themselves for a wave of digital fakes that could deceive viewers or make it harder to know what is true or false online.
"What's different is that everybody can do it now," said Britt Paris, an assistant professor of library and information science at Rutgers University who helped coin the term "cheapfakes." "It's not just people with sophisticated computational technology and fairly sophisticated computational know-how. Instead, it's a free app."
Reams of manipulated content have circulated on TikTok and elsewhere for years, typically using more homespun tricks like careful editing or the swapping of one audio clip for another. In one video on TikTok, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to say everyone hospitalized for Covid-19 was vaccinated. In fact, she said the patients were unvaccinated.
Graphika, a research firm that studies disinformation, spotted deepfakes of fictional news anchors that pro-China bot accounts distributed late last year, in the first known example of the technology's being used for state-aligned influence campaigns.
But several new tools offer similar technology to everyday internet users, giving comedians and partisans the chance to make their own convincing spoofs.
Last month, a fake video circulated showing President Biden declaring a national draft for the war between Russia and Ukraine. The video was produced by the team behind "Human Events Daily," a podcast and livestream run by Jack Posobiec, a right-wing influencer known for spreading conspiracy theories.
In a segment explaining the video, Mr. Posobiec said his team had created it using A.I. technology. A tweet about the video from The Patriot Oasis, a conservative account, used a breaking news label without indicating the video was fake. The tweet was viewed more than eight million times.
Many of the video clips featuring synthesized voices appeared to use technology from ElevenLabs, an American start-up co-founded by a former Google engineer. In November, the company debuted a speech-cloning tool that can be trained to replicate voices in seconds.
ElevenLabs attracted attention last month after 4chan, a message board known for racist and conspiratorial content, used the tool to share hateful messages. In one example, 4chan users created an audio recording of an anti-Semitic text using a computer-generated voice that mimicked the actor Emma Watson. Motherboard reported earlier on 4chan's use of the audio technology.
ElevenLabs said on Twitter that it would introduce new safeguards, like limiting voice cloning to paid accounts and providing a new A.I. detecting tool. But 4chan users said they would create their own version of the voice-cloning technology using open source code, posting demos that sound similar to audio produced by ElevenLabs.
"We want to have our own custom AI with the power to create," an anonymous 4chan user wrote in a post about the project.
In an email, a spokeswoman for ElevenLabs said the company was looking to collaborate with other A.I. developers to create a universal detection system that could be adopted across the industry.
Videos using cloned voices, created with ElevenLabs' tool or similar technology, have gone viral in recent weeks. One, posted on Twitter by Elon Musk, the site's owner, showed a profanity-laced fake conversation among Mr. Rogan, Mr. Musk and Jordan Peterson, a Canadian men's rights activist. In another, posted on YouTube, Mr. Rogan appeared to interview a fake version of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, about his political scandals.
"The production of such fakes should be a crime with a mandatory ten-year sentence," Mr. Peterson said in a tweet about fake videos featuring his voice. "This tech is dangerous beyond belief."
In a statement, a spokeswoman for YouTube said the video of Mr. Rogan and Mr. Trudeau did not violate the platform's policies because it "provides sufficient context." (The creator had described it as a "fake video.") The company said its misinformation policies banned content that was doctored in a misleading way.
Experts who study deepfake technology suggested that the fake ad featuring Mr. Rogan and Dr. Huberman had most likely been created with a voice-cloning program, though the exact tool used was not clear. The audio of Mr. Rogan was spliced into a real interview with Dr. Huberman discussing testosterone.
The results are not perfect. Mr. Rogan's clip was taken from an unrelated interview posted in December with Fedor Gorst, a professional pool player. Mr. Rogan's mouth movements are mismatched to the audio, and his voice sounds unnatural at times. If the video convinced TikTok users, it was hard to tell: It attracted far more attention after it was flagged for its impressive fakery.
TikTok's policies prohibit digital forgeries "that mislead users by distorting the truth of events and cause significant harm to the subject of the video, other persons or society." Several of the videos were removed after The New York Times flagged them to the company. Twitter also removed some of the videos.
A TikTok spokesman said the company used "a combination of technology and human moderation to detect and remove" manipulated videos, but declined to elaborate on its methods.
Mr. Rogan and the company featured in the fake ad did not respond to requests for comment.
Many social media companies, including Meta and Twitch, have banned deepfakes and manipulated videos that deceive users. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, ran a competition in 2021 to develop programs capable of identifying deepfakes, resulting in one tool that could spot them 83 percent of the time.
Federal regulators have been slow to respond. One federal law from 2019 requested a report on the weaponization of deepfakes by foreigners, required government agencies to notify Congress if deepfakes targeted elections in the United States and created a prize to encourage the research on tools that could detect deepfakes.
"We cannot wait for two years until laws are passed," said Ravit Dotan, a postdoctoral researcher who runs the Collaborative A.I. Responsibility Lab at the University of Pittsburgh. "By then, the damage could be too much. We have an election coming up here in the U.S. It's going to be an issue."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
It wouldn’t be completely out of character for Joe Rogan, the comedian turned podcaster, to endorse a “libido-boosting” coffee brand for men.
But when a video circulating on TikTok recently showed Rogan and his guest, Andrew Huberman, hawking the coffee, some eagle-eyed viewers were shocked — including Huberman.
“Yep that’s fake,” Huberman wrote on Twitter after seeing the ad, in which he appears to praise the coffee’s testosterone-boosting potential, even though he never did.
The ad was one of a growing number of fake videos on social media made with technology powered by artificial intelligence. Experts said Rogan’s voice appeared to have been synthesized using AI tools that mimic celebrity voices. Huberman’s comments were ripped from an unrelated interview.
Making realistic fake videos, often called deepfakes, once required elaborate software to put one person’s face onto another’s. But now, many of the tools to create them are available to everyday consumers — even on smartphone apps, and often for little to no money.
The new altered videos — mostly, so far, the work of meme-makers and marketers — have gone viral on social media sites like TikTok and Twitter. The content they produce, sometimes called cheapfakes by researchers, work by cloning celebrity voices, altering mouth movements to match alternative audio and writing persuasive dialogue.
The videos, and the accessible technology behind them, have some AI researchers fretting about their dangers, and have raised fresh concerns over whether social media companies are prepared to moderate the growing digital fakery.
Disinformation watchdogs are also steeling themselves for a wave of digital fakes that could deceive viewers or make it harder to know what is true or false online.
“What’s different is that everybody can do it now,” said Britt Paris, an assistant professor of library and information science at Rutgers University who helped coin the term “cheapfakes.” “It’s not just people with sophisticated computational technology and fairly sophisticated computational know-how. Instead, it’s a free app.”
Reams of manipulated content have circulated on TikTok and elsewhere for years, typically using more homespun tricks like careful editing or the swapping of one audio clip for another. In one video on TikTok, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to say everyone hospitalized for COVID-19 was vaccinated. In fact, she said the patients were unvaccinated.
Graphika, a research firm that studies disinformation, spotted deepfakes of fictional news anchors that pro-China bot accounts distributed late last year, in the first known example of the technology being used for state-aligned influence campaigns.
But several new tools offer similar technology to everyday internet users, giving comedians and partisans the chance to make their own convincing spoofs.
Last month, a fake video circulated showing President Joe Biden declaring a national draft for the war between Russia and Ukraine. The video was produced by the team behind “Human Events Daily,” a podcast and livestream run by Jack Posobiec, a right-wing influencer known for spreading conspiracy theories.
In a segment explaining the video, Posobiec said his team had created it using AI technology. A tweet about the video from The Patriot Oasis, a conservative account, used a breaking news label without indicating the video was fake. The tweet was viewed more than 8 million times.
Many of the video clips featuring synthesized voices appeared to use technology from ElevenLabs, an American startup co-founded by a former Google engineer. In November, the company debuted a speech-cloning tool that can be trained to replicate voices in seconds.
ElevenLabs attracted attention last month after 4chan, a message board known for racist and conspiratorial content, used the tool to share hateful messages. In one example, 4chan users created an audio recording of an antisemitic text using a computer-generated voice that mimicked actor Emma Watson. Motherboard reported earlier on 4chan’s use of the audio technology.
ElevenLabs said on Twitter that it would introduce new safeguards, like limiting voice cloning to paid accounts and providing a new AI detecting tool. But 4chan users said they would create their own version of the voice-cloning technology using open source code, posting demos that sound similar to audio produced by ElevenLabs.
“We want to have our own custom AI with the power to create,” an anonymous 4chan user wrote in a post about the project.
In an email, a spokesperson for ElevenLabs said the company was looking to collaborate with other AI developers to create a universal detection system that could be adopted across the industry.
Videos using cloned voices, created with ElevenLabs’ tool or similar technology, have gone viral in recent weeks. One, posted on Twitter by Elon Musk, the site’s owner, showed a profanity-laced fake conversation among Rogan, Musk and Jordan Peterson, a Canadian men’s rights activist. In another, posted on YouTube, Rogan appeared to interview a fake version of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, about his political scandals.
“The production of such fakes should be a crime with a mandatory ten-year sentence,” Peterson said in a tweet about fake videos featuring his voice. “This tech is dangerous beyond belief.”
In a statement, a spokesperson for YouTube said the video of Rogan and Trudeau did not violate the platform’s policies because it “provides sufficient context.” (The creator had described it as a “fake video.”) The company said its misinformation policies banned content that was doctored in a misleading way.
Experts who study deepfake technology suggested that the fake ad featuring Rogan and Huberman had most likely been created with a voice-cloning program, though the exact tool used was not clear. The audio of Rogan was spliced into a real interview with Huberman discussing testosterone.
The results are not perfect. Rogan’s clip was taken from an unrelated interview posted in December with Fedor Gorst, a professional pool player. Rogan’s mouth movements are mismatched to the audio, and his voice sounds unnatural at times. If the video convinced TikTok users, it was hard to tell: It attracted far more attention after it was flagged for its impressive fakery.
TikTok’s policies prohibit digital forgeries “that mislead users by distorting the truth of events and cause significant harm to the subject of the video, other persons or society.” Several of the videos were removed after The New York Times flagged them to the company. Twitter also removed some of the videos.
A TikTok spokesperson said the company used “a combination of technology and human moderation to detect and remove” manipulated videos, but declined to elaborate on its methods.
Rogan and the company featured in the fake ad did not respond to requests for comment.
Many social media companies, including Meta and Twitch, have banned deepfakes and manipulated videos that deceive users. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, ran a competition in 2021 to develop programs capable of identifying deepfakes, resulting in one tool that could spot them 83% of the time.

Is It 'Just Another Jumper'? Not Exactly.: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: How Delia Barry, the octogenarian who knitted Colin Farrell's cozy "Banshees of Inisherin" sweaters, became an internet star.
When I first contacted Delia Barry, she asked to be called back later. It was a Wednesday afternoon in Greystones, Ireland, where she lives, and she was playing bingo. "It's just more of a social gathering for local senior citizens, which I am one of," Ms. Barry, 83, said by telephone.
When not at bingo, Ms. Barry is usually knitting. Four of her sweaters appear in the Oscar-nominated film "The Banshees of Inisherin," which is set on a fictional island in 1923, toward the end of the Irish civil war. These include a navy roll-neck and a red pullover with a distinctive long collar, both worn by Colin Farrell; a thick blue knit worn by Brendan Gleeson; and a purplish ribbed fisherman's sweater worn by Barry Keoghan. Esquire U.K. called "Banshees" the "Next Great Knitwear Film."
Ms. Barry received a shout-out in the film's credits, for knitwear, and her story has since gone viral on Instagram and TikTok, where teenagers and 20-somethings have shown off their attempts to recreate her designs.
"It's pure madness," she said of the attention. "I've knitted so many jumpers, they are just another jumper to me." She hopes to see the film a second time soon, she said, to better appreciate the acting and Martin McDonagh's direction. "When I went the first time, I was just looking for the knitwear," she said.
Ms. Barry learned to knit at school in Cahir, County Tipperary, at age 7. As a teenager, she made her own clothes, trying out new patterns, perfecting shapes. At 20, she moved to London with her future husband and worked in a telephone factory. More than a decade later, they returned to Tipperary, where Ms. Barry worked in a bar before moving to her husband's birthplace of County Wicklow, where the town of Greystones is.
"Here is where I'll be staying now," she said. "I won't be moving again."
Ms. Barry knitted throughout her marriage, she said, but her commitment grew when her husband died in 2010, and she began knitting to raise funds for Greystones Cancer Support. "They were very good when he was diagnosed," she said. She donated a portion of her film earnings to the organization. "You never know when you're going to need them," she said.
On an average week, Ms. Barry rises at 6 a.m. and knits until 8:30 a.m. She always knits in the same spot -- on her sofa, with the light from the window behind her. At 9:30, she goes for a walk to the beach with a friend, about two miles away. She has never owned a car, she said, and has walked everywhere her whole life. (She has also never used email.)
They'll get a coffee and watch the sea for an hour. Back home, she'll knit for another three to four hours. She'll take a short break for dinner, then knit throughout the evening. "I get up and walk around every so often," she said.
Knitting is therapeutic for Ms. Barry. "When you're living on your own, it's nice to have something to do," she said. She knitted the sweaters for "The Banshees of Inisherin" during one of Ireland's pandemic lockdowns, spending a week on each. "It kept me sane," she said.
Ms. Barry said she was sad that young people today don't learn knitting in school. She and her husband had no children of their own, but they helped raise her nieces and nephews when her sister died unexpectedly. Her younger relatives have followed Ms. Barry's viral fame with amusement. "They say: 'You're not going to know us now. We'll have to make any appointment just to talk to you."'
Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh, the film's costume designer, commissioned Ms. Barry to create the sweaters. After the release of the movie, Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh recalled, "My daughter, who is 20, came and said Delia is a TikTok sensation."
Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh came across Ms. Barry's work when she was sourcing knitwear for a 2017 television adaptation of "Little Women." A woman working on the production knew that Ms. Barry had helped on other films, including "Dancing at Lughnasa," for which she created knitwear for Meryl Streep's character.
"Ireland is very small," Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said, laughing. "It's all word of mouth."
Ms. Barry credits her success to being willing to take on a job without a pattern, something many knitters would be wary of. For "The Banshees of Inisherin," Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh provided photographs of Irish fishermen from the 1920s, which Ms. Barry studied with a magnifying glass. One showed a sweater with a distinctive long collar, the inspiration for the red piece that would become Mr. Farrell's.
"We were really lucky to be able to make all the costumes for the principal characters," Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. "Not just the knitwear, but the tailoring, the hats." Ms. Barry is not the only older figure involved: Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh's tailor is well into his 80s. "I say every day, what are we going to do if he ever retires!" she said.
Once each item was complete, it went to the aging department, where pieces are dyed and distressed. "People think they just take a cheese grater to it, but it's not as simple as that," Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. She sees the process as a means of communicating subtleties about a character -- somebody who walks purposefully with their hands wedged in their pockets, somebody who gets nervous and wipes their hands on the front of their clothing.
Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh theorized that Mr. Farrell's on-screen sister, Siobhan (played by Kerry Condon), would have made his red sweater. "These were very much day-to-day activities at that time -- knitting, making, darning," she said. "Siobhan would have thought, "Well. Mammy and Daddy are dead, and he's my little brother, and I'm going to look after him, and I want him to look good, so I'll put a collar on it as a little touch."
Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh saw the piece as a gesture of love and protectiveness. Wrapped up in that collar, and the boyish length of it, were Mr. Farrell's character's innocence and naïveté, which are essential to the film's plot.
Mr. Farrell himself was skeptical of the sweater at first, worried about the fit, Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. So Ms. Barry started afresh. In the end he loved it. "With an item like that, you really have to sell it to the actor," Ms. Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. "He has to believe that his character is going to wear this."
The film has been praised for the way it deals with masculinity, friendship and loneliness, but aging is also a theme, especially the fear that one has not made enough of one's life. In one scene, Mr. Gleeson stands before Mr. Farrell and says, "I just have this tremendous sense of time slipping away from me." Ms. Barry identifies with that sentiment.
"This is all coming too late for me," she said. "I do think if this had happened maybe 20 years ago it would have been nice."
Still, she added, "I'm not past it yet." Her recent success has made her feel valued, she said, and she is already at work with Ms. Ní Mhaoldomhnaigh on pieces for a new film.
"Because you get older, it doesn't mean that you're not useful anymore," Ms. Barry said. "There's a lot we can do, if we want to."

Putting Black Design in a Spotlight: [SpecialSections]

Full text: How tastemakers in three world capitals are driving appreciation for Black creators and collectibles.
This article is part of our Design special section on how the recent push for diversity in design is changing the way the world looks.
Even when Tione Trice was a child in Atlanta in the 1990s, he nurtured a love for a design style he called African Essentialism that was nothing like the Eurocentric goods that surrounded him. "I would see these photos and art books and I wanted to create that for myself," he said. "Things that had a natural feel."
Mr. Trice, 36, became an interior designer and boutique owner, opening a little shop called Of the Cloth in brownstone Brooklyn in 2021 and relocating it a year ago to a storefront at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. There, he sells African and African American antiques.
"I discovered Sheila Bridges and Rachel Ashwell," he said of two interior designers who translated their distinct aesthetic sensibilities into products. "I saw them starting their careers as collectors and sellers and thought, 'This is how I'll enter the market."'
What reads as a heartwarming story of a childhood dream come true is complicated by a design market that is heavily white and newly reminded of that status following the launch of the Black Lives Matter movement. As the design industry grapples with its identity, it is no simple feat to introduce a fresh aesthetic and new audiences. But Mr. Trice is part of a flourishing crop of Black entrepreneurs who are doing just that.
He combines his retail operation with interior design services for collectors and brands. "I feel Black people visit the shop to be part of it," he said. "These people are holding on to their dollar because they want to spend it with me. There are no shops like what I do in the city: People come to me for truth. They come to me for rare."
His presentation style defies the Instagram trend toward stark interiors. "It's very challenging for a Black person to be a minimalist because we don't have enough museums to store our things," he said. "When your grandmother passes, it has to go to someone in your family."
Like Mr. Trice, Jenna Fletcher, the founder of an online design platform called Oswalde Shop, offers a curatorial vision for Black collectors and companies hungry for direction.
Born in London to an English father and a British Barbadian mother, the 31-year-old Ms. Fletcher casts an astute eye on African practitioners whose international reputations are catching up with their gifts. She has showcased the furnishings of Nifemi Marcus-Bello, a Nigerian who last year won the prestigious Hublot Design Prize for innovative talent, and Andu Masebo, a young Londoner whom Wallpaper magazine has deemed a "future icon."
"My whole thing was placing Black designers in the same frame as the highly regarded cult designers, like Castiglioni and Mario Bellini," Ms. Fletcher said, referring to eminences who are (or in Achille Castiglioni's case, were) white Italian men.
She rejects the descriptions of much Black design as craft-based and "vernacular" -- associated with, say, carvings sold in markets. She wants to reconfigure how Black designers are regarded, and it looks like she is succeeding.
"Every single product that I sold from Nifemi and Andu was sought after, well received and lusted for," she said.
While she elevates Black designers, her retail strategy is driven by an egalitarian philosophy. From the start, she priced her goods on a sliding scale. "I was being very favorable to young people of color in London," she said. "People would say, 'I really love this piece, but I don't have the cash,' and I'd ask what they could pay."
She wants interiors to join the "mainstream design epoch" and cultivate the same enthusiasm as trainers and street wear. It excites her to see "25-year-old dudes in London gassing over a design rack with the same ferocity I used to witness at Dover Street over a Tom Sachs Nike shoe," she said.
At the same time, she caters to an elite group. Virgil Abloh, the fashion and product designer, who died in 2021, was a customer, and she regularly dispenses advice about interiors to Black art collectors and corporate clients like the cult streetwear brand Story MFG. "It's about Black folks breaking into spaces," she said, "kicking down the door and being, quite frankly, better than everyone else."
Interior design is a new frontier that needs to be conquered by Black representatives, she said. "We've always curated our spaces, but we haven't had people stepping out and saying: 'I'm a tastemaker."'
Ajiri Aki, a Nigerian-born, Texas-reared, Paris-based specialist in the art of entertaining and the force behind the online tableware boutique Madame de la Maison, shows no hesitation in claiming her territory in design.
Madame de la Maison is ostensibly about elegant dining, but what you are really being sold is a lifestyle that is rarely associated with Black living. "Why can't Black people just have joy too? Black girl joy?" she asked.
When she first moved to Paris from New York in 2011, Ms. Aki, 43, found that the best way of getting to know people was inviting them to her home for a meal. That and an interest in vintage home goods turned into a business with multiple dimensions.
Last year, she led a group of mostly Black women around Provence, where they shopped for antiques and enjoyed long, lazy meals in the sun.
Next month, Clarkson Potter will publish Ms. Aki's book "Joie: A Parisian's Guide to Celebrating the Good Life," another expression of her belief that "setting the table and entertaining is a gift to yourself and others. It's absolutely my intention to make sure that gathering is something that we do more often and that it's beautiful."
All three entrepreneurs envision a future of expanded opportunities for Black artists, consumers and connoisseurs. Mr. Trice plans to develop a studio museum where Black designers can experiment with ceramics and textiles. "It will also be a space to archive African American and African diaspora goods," he said.
Ms. Fletcher imagines a gallery for young, marginalized Black designers where they can "feel like it's a world of our own making."
And Ms. Aki said she hopes that someone will come along and "be the Black Conran," alluding to Sir Terence Conran, the British design force who bent minds to his vision (of modernism) with his emporiums, Habitat and the Conran Shop.
"I hope that someone's going to get some big funding and build a store," she said.
As for now, all three are successfully uniting contemporary design with the construction of a new order where Blackness has an overdue seat at the table.
"It's quite extraordinary," Ms. Fletcher said. "I'm breaking into a space where no one looks like me and no one acts like me."

Joshua Bell's London, Step by Step: [Travel Desk]

Full text: "The first time I came to London, I was 17," the violinist Joshua Bell, now 55, told me. We were at dinner together following a recent performance of his at Wigmore Hall, a small but renowned concert hall. "I came with my parents to make my first album," he continued. "This was in the '80s, and I remember thinking there wasn't a lot of variety in food. Now, of course, it's great."
Mr. Bell estimates he's been to London around 70 times since then.
So no, the virtuoso and onetime child prodigy doesn't live in London. But you could say he's a professional visitor. His London is one of exquisite taste, uncommonly good food and a handful of tiny places you'd breeze right by if you didn't know they were there -- with, of course, a measure of music.
Mr. Bell tends to favor lesser-known places, with one very notable exception: the Royal Albert Hall. "The Royal Albert Hall has this thing called the Proms. They take out the seats on the lower level, and people line up down the street to get in," he said. "All these people are standing up like it's a rock concert, and it's Beethoven symphonies. It's incredible."
Here are five of his favorite places to visit in London.
1. J.&A. Beare
"In August 2001, I walked into Charles Beare's shop to pick up a set of strings, and Charles Beare said to me, 'You have to take a look at the Huberman violin, it's on its way to Germany."' The instrument, made by Antonio Stradivari in 1713 and known as the Gibson ex Huberman, was legendary. "I knew the famous story of the violin," Mr. Bell said, recounting its theft from a dressing room at Carnegie Hall in 1936.
"Charles Beare put me in a room with the violin and after a few notes, I was shaking with excitement. I was in love with it. I had a concert at the Royal Albert Hall -- at the Proms -- and used that violin that very night."
Even if you're not in the market for a multimillion-euro violin, J.&A. Beare is worth a visit. The shop is open to the public -- but if you want to see the collection of nearly priceless violins, book ahead.
2. Trishna
"I did an event in New York with Salman Rushdie," Mr. Bell said. "At one point, we were talking about London and he recommended Trishna. I love Indian food, but Trishna is not your typical Indian restaurant. The problem with Indian food for me is that I want to try a lot of things. I don't just want to have one lamb curry as my dinner." Instead, Mr. Bell likes to get the five-course tasting menu -- "and a crab dish that's really great," he said.
The Michelin-starred restaurant, with its private nooks, mirrored walls, delicately gilded surfaces, feels like a special occasion kind of place. It's also best to come hungry. "I like places where they just get the tasting menu because I eat everything," says Mr. Bell. "I like the person cooking it to choose what he wants to present."
3. Wigmore Hall
"Wigmore Hall doesn't have name recognition to the general public," said Mr. Bell of the 552-seat concert hall in Marylebone. With its small stage and red velvet seating, Wigmore Hall has a hushed, intimate appeal. "One of the problems with classical music is that it's developed a reputation of formality. I've actually seen classical musicians admonish the audience for clapping at the wrong time. In fact, classical music can be the most exciting thing to watch."
"Having said that, it's nice that there are places like Wigmore Hall where you know everyone understands. It's like for an actor to do theater in a place where people really get it. And Wigmore Hall has history for me personally. The first concert there -- I think it was 1901 -- was played by the teacher of my teacher, Ysaÿe, the greatest violinist at the end of the 19th century in Europe. I feel the history when I walk on the stage."
4. Baglioni Hotel
When days are packed with rehearsals and evenings are given to performing, proximity to one's bed is important -- as is a nice hotel around that bed. And so when Mr. Bell plays at the Royal Albert Hall, he always stays at Hotel Baglioni, a stone's throw away. "It's an Italian boutique hotel and has a very intimate feel," he said. "It feels like people know you there, and the rooms have this sort of very sexy vibe -- they're just very boudoir-like and dark. I sleep better in those kinds of rooms."
Its location also means he can "walk to the rehearsals and back -- you can also walk right across the street to Hyde Park. It's my home when I'm at the Proms."
5. Fidelio Cafe
"Very few places like this exist -- or dare to offer this," said Mr. Bell of Fidelio Cafe. The "this" in question is the intersection of a sweet little bistro and live, world-class classical music.
Imagine a small cafe where the walls are papered in actual sheet music, a grand piano greets you at the front door and the menu -- with its home-roasted granola, slow-cooked aubergine and roasted cherry tomato bruschetta -- seems crafted from the morning's farmer's market.
It's also "about the uniqueness of having a meal in an intimate space while hearing chamber music," Mr. Bell said. "It's clearly a passion project for the owner, who loves classical music and food and puts them together."
"One of my dreams is to open a food-slash-music venue," he added. "When I see places like Fidelio, I love that people are thinking outside the box and celebrating classic music in such an unusual way."

When I first contacted Delia Barry, she asked to be called back later. It was a Wednesday afternoon in Greystones, Ireland, where she lives, and she was playing bingo. “It’s just more of a social gathering for local senior citizens, which I am one of,” Barry, 83, said by telephone.
When not at bingo, Barry is usually knitting. Four of her sweaters appear in the Oscar-nominated film “The Banshees of Inisherin,” which is set on a fictional island in 1923, toward the end of the Irish civil war. These include a navy roll-neck and a red pullover with a distinctive long collar, both worn by Colin Farrell; a thick blue knit worn by Brendan Gleeson; and a purplish ribbed fisherman’s sweater worn by Barry Keoghan. Esquire U.K. called “Banshees” the “Next Great Knitwear Film.”
Barry received a shout-out in the film’s credits, for knitwear, and her story has since gone viral on Instagram and TikTok, where teenagers and 20-somethings have shown off their attempts to re-create her designs.
“It’s pure madness,” she said of the attention. “I’ve knitted so many jumpers, they are just another jumper to me.” She hopes to see the film a second time soon, she said, to better appreciate the acting and Martin McDonagh’s direction. “When I went the first time, I was just looking for the knitwear,” she said.
Barry learned to knit at school in Cahir, County Tipperary, at age 7. As a teenager, she made her own clothes, trying out new patterns, perfecting shapes. At 20, she moved to London with her future husband and worked in a telephone factory. More than a decade later, they returned to Tipperary, where Barry worked in a bar before moving to her husband’s birthplace of County Wicklow, where the town of Greystones is.
“Here is where I’ll be staying now,” she said. “I won’t be moving again.”
Barry knitted throughout her marriage, she said, but her commitment grew when her husband died in 2010, and she began knitting to raise funds for Greystones Cancer Support. “They were very good when he was diagnosed,” she said. She donated a portion of her film earnings to the organization. “You never know when you’re going to need them,” she said.
On an average week, Barry rises at 6 a.m. and knits until 8:30 a.m. She always knits in the same spot — on her sofa, with the light from the window behind her. At 9:30, she goes for a walk to the beach with a friend, about 2 miles away. She has never owned a car, she said, and has walked everywhere her whole life. (She has also never used email.)
They’ll get a coffee and watch the sea for an hour. Back home, she’ll knit for another three to four hours. She’ll take a short break for dinner, then knit throughout the evening. “I get up and walk around every so often,” she said.
Knitting is therapeutic for Barry. “When you’re living on your own, it’s nice to have something to do,” she said. She knitted the sweaters for “The Banshees of Inisherin” during one of Ireland’s pandemic lockdowns, spending a week on each. “It kept me sane,” she said.
Barry said she was sad that young people today don’t learn knitting in school. She and her husband had no children of their own, but they helped raise her nieces and nephews when her sister died unexpectedly. Her younger relatives have followed Barry’s viral fame with amusement. “They say: ‘You’re not going to know us now. We’ll have to make any appointment just to talk to you.’”
Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh, the film’s costume designer, commissioned Barry to create the sweaters. After the release of the movie, Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh recalled, “My daughter, who is 20, came and said Delia is a TikTok sensation.”
Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh came across Barry’s work when she was sourcing knitwear for a 2017 television adaptation of “Little Women.” A woman working on the production knew that Barry had helped on other films, including “Dancing at Lughnasa,” for which she created knitwear for Meryl Streep’s character.
“Ireland is very small,” Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said, laughing. “It’s all word-of-mouth.”
Barry credits her success to being willing to take on a job without a pattern, something many knitters would be wary of. For “The Banshees of Inisherin,” Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh provided photographs of Irish fishermen from the 1920s, which Barry studied with a magnifying glass. One showed a sweater with a distinctive long collar, the inspiration for the red piece that would become Farrell’s.
“We were really lucky to be able to make all the costumes for the principal characters,” Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. “Not just the knitwear, but the tailoring, the hats.” Barry is not the only older figure involved: Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh’s tailor is well into his 80s. “I say every day, what are we going to do if he ever retires!” she said.
Once each item was complete, it went to the aging department, where pieces are dyed and distressed. “People think they just take a cheese grater to it, but it’s not as simple as that,” Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. She sees the process as a means of communicating subtleties about a character — somebody who walks purposefully with their hands wedged in their pockets, somebody who gets nervous and wipes their hands on the front of their clothing.
Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh theorized that Farrell’s on-screen sister, Siobhan (played by Kerry Condon), would have made his red sweater. “These were very much day-to-day activities at that time — knitting, making, darning,” she said. “Siobhan would have thought, “Well. Mammy and Daddy are dead, and he’s my little brother, and I’m going to look after him, and I want him to look good, so I’ll put a collar on it as a little touch.”
Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh saw the piece as a gesture of love and protectiveness. Wrapped up in that collar, and the boyish length of it, were Farrell’s character’s innocence and naïveté, which are essential to the film’s plot.
Farrell himself was skeptical of the sweater at first, worried about the fit, Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. So Barry started afresh. In the end he loved it. “With an item like that, you really have to sell it to the actor,” Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh said. “He has to believe that his character is going to wear this.”
The film has been praised for the way it deals with masculinity, friendship and loneliness, but aging is also a theme, especially the fear that one has not made enough of one’s life. In one scene, Gleeson stands before Farrell and says, “I just have this tremendous sense of time slipping away from me.” Barry identifies with that sentiment.
“This is all coming too late for me,” she said. “I do think if this had happened maybe 20 years ago it would have been nice.”
Still, she added, “I’m not past it yet.” Her recent success has made her feel valued, she said, and she is already at work with Ní Mhaoldomhnaigh on pieces for a new film.
“Because you get older, it doesn’t mean that you’re not useful anymore,” Barry said. “There’s a lot we can do, if we want to.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Buy Something in Paris, Then Brag: [Style Desk]

Full text: Some classics, some new, some destination vintage boutiques worth checking out if you're lucky to be in France.
Paris is a city of easy pleasures. Wine, cheese, croissants. What's not to love? Isn't that what Netflix built the popularity of the très unrealistic "Emily in Paris" on? Except the thing about Paris is that it seems like a foolproof place, but it's not. Rather, it is a city that rewards research.
Prioritize idiosyncratic shops. Paris is still the kind of place where you can stumble upon a boutique that sells only gloves or umbrellas. There is nothing better than being able to announce to anyone listening that you got some supple belt or slipper or lamp or toothpaste in Paris.
Definitely check on the hours that shops are open because they can be highly unusual from a New Yorker's perspective. Some require appointments, but don't be intimidated by that. Be enticed at the potential, the uniqueness, the fun.
Strategize your day by neighborhood groupings. In the morning, go to a few stores around, say, Place Vendôme, capped off with a lazy lunch and some of the all-time great people-watching at Hotel Costes. (A fun game: "Is that his daughter or his girlfriend?") If you're a real demon, move on to another neighborhood. Otherwise take a nap, then go to a small museum like Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, which is like entering into a Wes Anderson film set.
Paris has many of the same designer boutiques as New York and other large cities, so you might skip them. However! Between the exchange rate and the VAT return (a.k.a., tax refund), designer goods can be significantly cheaper. You'll need your passport in store. At the airport, remember to scan the forms or have them stamped before you check in and go through customs, as sometimes they ask to see the goods in person. Basically, this is a crucial way to justify buying things.
Resee
This is an online consignment store, but you can make an appointment and send links of what you like, then try it all on at its showroom. Allow Matt, who runs the showroom, to bring you a coffee, and try on a Jil Sander paisley dress from when Raf Simons was the designer or an ivory Chanel jacket like the one in "The Devil Wears Prada" or a ruffled Prada blouse consigned by Catherine Deneuve.
Le Bon Marché
All grand (and less than grand) department stores owe their existences to this place. Émile Zola used it as the setting for "The Ladies Paradise," in 1883. Here's how I navigate it. I go to the lingerie-swimwear section. The Empreinte lingerie brand for large busts and plus sizes is hard to find in the United States but has the most comfortable and beautiful collections.
The second floor has a beauty section for niche brands, where you can buy hair masks and dental floss from brands you've never heard of. Then do a loop of the designer collections as an overview to see which ones speak to you. Go to, say, Dries Van Noten for an immersive experience. Go to the Buly counter for souvenirs, like a lip balm that comes in a box that can be embossed with initials. Buy snacks at the food hall across the street, which sells things like carrot-passion fruit jam and has at least three aisles dedicated to yogurt. Open Sundays!
Sabbia Rosa
If your ideal look is '90s off-duty supermodel, this is your heaven. There are exquisite but extremely expensive handmade slips here. Everything can be custom-made, which is dangerous. Do not skip the satin mule slippers with the bow.
Monoprix
Monoprix is basically the French equivalent of Target. The organic cotton underwear comes in a ribbed culotte -- a bikini style -- or culotte haute, which is more like granny panties. They're not dissimilar to the handmade underwear from Zimmerli or Hanro but around five euros. Stock up on Savon de Marseille hand soap and filet à provisions, those net market bags.
Em Archives
This new vintage showroom made a cameo in the Blackbird Spyplane newsletter. On a recent visit, it had at least one oversize Donna Karan blouse, an Hermès blazer, Comme des Garçons flats from 1997 and several pairs of Jil Sander trousers at extremely competitive prices.
Flea Market
There are several flea markets in Paris, but the largest is the Puces de Paris Saint-Ouen at the northern border of the city. The place is gigantic, so you absolutely need some kind of strategy. Choose a category (a friend had great luck looking for antique tablecloths) or pick one area to browse. The Marché Paul Bert Serpette is my favorite and has a mix of furniture and clothes.
Will you find a deal? Maybe. Will you want to buy a chair and ship it home? Absolutely! There are shipping companies on site, or just build it a box and check it as oversize luggage on a flight home. For something easier to take home, De Laurentis has late '80s and early '90s European and Japanese minimalist designer clothes, and Chantal has beaded flapper dresses reminiscent of the first Bode women's collection.
Charvet
Who doesn't want to authentically dress like Lydia Tár these days? This is a multistory palace of tailoring. Get the slippers, get a striped nightshirt that can be worn as a dress, maybe get a rosette brooch made out of necktie material. Then cross to the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a cocktail. It's sort of like the Bemelmans Bar of Paris.
La Tuile à Loup
Maybe its stern but direct Instagram bio says it all: "Finest of handmade tableware. MADE IN FRANCE. International shipping available." Do you want a vase with a jellyfish on it? Or how about a marbled tray? Maybe all you need to know is that Ina Garten was recently photographed there.

David Lindley, 78, a Master of Strings Who Was Sought After by Rock's Elite: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He worked with a wide range of luminaries, most notably Jackson Browne, and there was seemingly no stringed instrument he couldn't play.
David Lindley, the rare Los Angeles session guitarist to find fame in his own right, both as an eclectic solo artist and as a marquee collaborator on landmark recordings by Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Rod Stewart and many others, died on Friday. He was 78.
His death was announced on his website. The announcement did not say where he died or cite a cause, although he was said to have been battling kidney trouble, pneumonia, influenza and other ailments.
With his head-turning mastery of seemingly any instrument with strings, Mr. Lindley became one of the most sought-after sidemen in Los Angeles in the 1970s. Mixing searing slide guitar work with global stylings on instruments from around the world, he brought depth and richness to recordings by luminaries like Bob Dylan, Dolly Parton, Warren Zevon, Ry Cooder and Iggy Pop.
But he was far more than a supporting player. "One of the most talented musicians there has ever been," Graham Nash wrote on Instagram after Mr. Lindley's death. (Mr. Lindley toured with Mr. Nash and David Crosby in the 1970s.) "He was truly a musician's musician."
On Twitter, Peter Frampton wrote that Mr. Lindley's "unique sound and style gave him away in one note."
Mr. Lindley, who was known for his blizzard of curly brown hair and an ironic smirk, first made his mark in the late 1960s with the band Kaleidoscope, whose Middle East-inflected acid-pop albums, like "Side Trips" (1967) and "A Beacon From Mars" (1968), have become collector's items among the cognoscenti.
He embarked on a solo career in 1981 with "El Rayo-X," a party album that mixed rock, blues, reggae, Zydeco and Middle Eastern music and included a memorably snarling cover of K.C. Douglas's "Mercury Blues."
By that point in his career, Mr. Lindley was already treasured among the rock elite for providing an earthiness and globe-trotting flair to the breezy California soft-rock wafting from the canyons of Los Angeles in the 1970s.
He is best known for his work with Mr. Browne, with whom he toured and served as a featured performer on every Browne album from "For Everyman" (1973) to "Hold Out" (1980). His inventive fretwork was a cornerstone of many of Mr. Browne's biggest hits, including the smash single "Running on Empty," on which Mr. Lindley's plaintive yet soaring lap steel guitar work helped capture both the exhaustion and the exhilaration of life on the road, as expressed in Mr. Browne's lyrics.

Mr. Lindley's guitar and fiddle could also be heard on landmark pop albums like Ms. Ronstadt's "Heart Like a Wheel" (1974), which included the No. 1 single "You're No Good," and Rod Stewart's "A Night on the Town" (1976), highlighted by the chart-topping single "Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)."
Ever on the hunt for new sounds and textures, Mr. Lindley had "no idea" how many instruments he could play, as he told Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2000. But throughout his career he showed a knack for wringing emotion not only from the violin, mandolin, banjo, dulcimer and autoharp, but also from the Indian tanpura, the Middle Eastern oud and the Turkish saz.
Despite his position at the center of the Los Angeles rock firmament, he kept a low-key presence both onstage and in life, steering clear of the epic hedonism of the era.
"I'm kind of a social misfit when it comes to after-show parties, so I usually went back to the hotel," Mr. Lindley said in a 2013 interview. "There's danger at those after-show parties, you know what I mean? I couldn't do that. And I had no real idea how to schmooze and do any of this stuff."
David Perry Lindley was born on March 21, 1944, in Los Angeles one of five children of John Lindley, a lawyer, and Margaret (Wells) Lindley. He grew up in San Marino, Calif., an upscale city near Pasadena, where his father, a musical connoisseur, filled the house with sounds from around the world, including masters of the Indian sitar and the Greek bouzouki.
Drawing on those influences, by age 6 David had become obsessed with all manner of stringed instruments. "I even opened up the upright piano in the playhouse out in back of my parents' house to get at the strings," he recalled in a 2008 interview with the musician Ben Harper for the magazine Fretboard Journal.
His parents were less than enthusiastic when he channeled his energies into bluegrass. "I played the five-string banjo in the closet," he said in a recent video interview, "because it was very, very loud, and my mom and dad were a little disturbed by their son, the hillbilly musician."
Regardless, he found success with the instrument in the Los Angeles area, winning the annual Topanga Banjo-Fiddle Contest five times. After graduating from La Salle High School in Pasadena, he played in a series of folk groups; in one of them, the Dry City Scat Band, he played alongside his fellow multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow, later a member of Kaleidoscope.
Although Kaleidoscope failed to hit the commercial jackpot, it turned heads within the music industry. Tom Donahue, the influential San Francisco disc jockey, called it "one of the best groups in the country." Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin once called Kaleidoscope "my favorite band of all time, my ideal band; absolutely brilliant."
But Mr. Lindley and his bandmates had little interest in doing what seemed necessary to pursue fame. Once, he recalled in the Acoustic Guitar interview, "we were sitting in the dressing room of the Whisky a Go Go, and a manager guy comes in and says, 'We can make you guys stars -- huge. But you'll have to do this, this and this, and you'll have to dress like this, too.' And we said, 'Get the hell out of here!' and sent the guy packing."
He is survived by his wife, Joan Darrow, the sister of his former bandmate Chris Darrow; their daughter, Rosanne; his brothers, John, Peter and Patrick; his sister, Anne Lindley Maich; and 10 grandchildren.
Mr. Lindley would eventually find a degree of stardom, with a big boost from Mr. Browne, whom he met in the late 1960s at a Los Angeles rock club called Magic Mushroom. Once they started working together, though, it was the boost that Mr. Lindley gave Mr. Browne that became obvious.
In a Rolling Stone interview in 2010, Mr. Browne recalled an early tour, when the audience was clamoring to hear his hit "Doctor My Eyes." The band, however, lacked the full array of instruments to capture the sound of the recording.
"We're playing at this concert at a college and they were calling for this song," he said. "And we said, 'What the hell, let's just play it.' And it was a revelation. The piano part is sturdy enough -- it's just playing fours -- and it was enough to support Lindley doing this insane grooving, swinging playing. He wasn't even the guitar player on the record. But he just ripped it up.
"And I realized then I didn't need a band to play with David. It just comes out of him."

Full text: The former star of the 1990s-era ABC sitcom is running as a Democrat for a seat in the Los Angeles area that is being vacated by Representative Adam B. Schiff.
Ben Savage, the former child actor who was the star of the ABC sitcom "Boy Meets World" in the 1990s, said on Monday that he was running to represent a Los Angeles-area district in Congress.
"I'm running for Congress because it's time to restore faith in government by offering reasonable, innovative and compassionate solutions to our country's most pressing issues," Mr. Savage, 42, said in a statement on Instagram.
"It's time for new and passionate leaders who can help move the country forward," he said. "Leaders who want to see the government operating at maximum capacity, unhindered by political divisions and special interests."
A representative for Mr. Savage did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Mr. Savage moved to Los Angeles in 1987 and landed a role two years later in "Little Monsters," a movie about a boy who discovers a world of monsters under his bed. He is best known for his role as Cory Matthews on "Boy Meets World," a coming-of-age sitcom that was a staple of ABC's Friday night lineup for seven seasons, from 1993 to 2000. He reprised his role in 2014 in a spinoff series, "Girl Meets World."
Mr. Savage, the younger brother of the actor, director and former child star Fred Savage, submitted paperwork to the Federal Election Commission in January to run as a Democrat in the 30th Congressional District, which includes parts of well-known Southern California cities like Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena. (For those familiar with both the show and Southern California geography, the district does not include Topanga Canyon, which shares a name with Cory Matthews's love interest and sits in the 32nd District.)
Mr. Savage, who lives in West Hollywood, is running to replace Representative Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat who led the first impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump and who is now seeking the Senate seat long held by Dianne Feinstein.
Ms. Feinstein, 89, announced last month that she would retire at the end of her term in 2024, capping more than three decades in office.
In November, Mr. Savage ran unsuccessfully for a seat on West Hollywood's City Council, earning less than 7 percent of the votes, according to the Los Angeles County Registrar's office.
For his congressional run, Mr. Savage, who described himself as a "proud Californian, union member and longtime resident of District 30," will campaign on affordable housing solutions, reforms and improvements to police-citizen interactions, and supporting women's health rights, according to his campaign website.
Mr. Savage, who graduated from Stanford University with a degree in political science, joins a growing list of California celebrities-turned-politicians.
Ronald Reagan was an actor in Hollywood before his political career, serving as the governor of California and the 40th president of the United States. In 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and former action-movie star, was sworn in as California's 38th governor, serving two terms. And Caitlyn Jenner, the Republican former Olympian and prominent transgender activist, unsuccessfully ran for governor of California in 2021.

WeWork Seeks Cash For Stability: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The co-working giant is close to an agreement with SoftBank and others for new money and to restructure its debt.
WeWork, the troubled office space company built by the entrepreneur Adam Neumann that has struggled to right itself in recent years, is in talks with investors to restructure its outstanding debt of more than $ 3 billion and raise more cash.
An infusion of cash would most likely give WeWork the hundreds of millions of dollars it needed to keep operating for at least a few years, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations. And restructuring its debt would give executives some leeway to continue reshaping the company without having to worry about running out of funds.
Yardi, a real estate software provider in Santa Barbara, Calif., is among the investors considering new investment in the company, the people said. Yardi has already been working closely with WeWork as it expands beyond offering co-working spaces to additional services like software for office management at its properties.
There is no guarantee that the WeWork deal will close, and even if it does, it could be weeks away, one of the people said.
The moves to overhaul WeWork's debt come after the company burned through over $ 700 million of cash last year. Still, the company's performance has gradually improved.
And the company's talks with investors underscore the continuing challenges to its business, which involves leasing office space from landlords and then charging customers to use it.
SoftBank, the Japanese investment conglomerate that is both WeWork's largest shareholder and its largest creditor, is playing a key role in the negotiations. It is not expected to, however, put any additional money into the company, the people said. Since 2017, SoftBank has poured more than $ 10 billion into WeWork and written off billions of dollars in losses on its investment.
SoftBank recently took more steps to shore up WeWork's financial footing. It lent WeWork $ 250 million in January, and last month agreed to increase the size of a debt facility and extended the date at which it had to be paid back to March 2025 from November this year.
In addition to SoftBank's efforts, the deal under discussion will give WeWork the breathing room to focus on improving its performance and growing the company, which involves finding areas to cut costs. In January, WeWork said it would cut 300 employee positions.
Sandeep Mathrani, a veteran of the real-estate industry who took over as chief executive in February 2020, has been working to improve the company's financials -- a task made easier as office occupancy, which was hit hard during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, ticked higher in the last quarter of 2022.
Last month, in a call with Wall Street analysts, Mr. Mathrani raised the possibility of a debt restructuring, saying that the company expected to work toward extending the dates by which its debt must be paid back. But the urgency to lighten its debt load may have increased as WeWork grapples with headwinds in its business.
Founded in 2010 in New York, WeWork, once a darling of the start-up world, has since become a cautionary tale. Mr. Neumann positioned WeWork as a technology-enabled company that transcended the traditional real estate business. It was a pitch that charmed well-known investors, such as Benchmark Capital, Fidelity and SoftBank, and convinced them to invest at valuations more akin to high-growth technology companies than real estate ones.
At its peak, WeWork was valued at $ 47 billion in early 2019, before it sought to go public. But Mr. Neumann's ambitions came hurtling to the ground as WeWork's losses mounted. The company failed to convince investors to buy into its planned initial public offering, forcing it to cancel those plans.
In September 2019, Mr. Neumann gave up the chief executive role. SoftBank spent billions of dollars to rescue the company -- which was in danger of running out of cash before the end of that year -- and buy out shareholders, including Mr. Neumann. The deal to save WeWork came with massive layoffs.
Things only worsened in 2020 when the pandemic shuttered offices and forced employees to work from home and away from WeWork's Instagram-ready rental spaces. The company's customers abandoned their memberships in droves.
At the time, WeWork said going public would provide new capital to grow the company while it cut costs by renegotiating its leases. It finally went public in October 2021, one of the many companies that did so by merging with a special purpose acquisition company.
But the company's value has continued to decline as it burns through cash. At the end of last year, WeWork had $ 287 million of cash, down from $ 924 million at the end of 2021. In the fourth quarter, WeWork said it lost $ 568 million as it juggled pricey leases while selling customers on new products, such as office management software. It ended 2022 with $ 15.6 billion of lease obligations and over $ 3 billion of borrowings weighing down its balance sheet.
The company's stock price shows just how nervous investors have been about its fate and its debt coming due over the next few years, most of which is owed to SoftBank. WeWork's shares have hovered around $ 1, down roughly 90 percent from its stock price when the company went public.
In the meantime, Mr. Neumann walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars. He is now running a new real estate start-up called Flow with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, the prominent venture firm.
Mr. Neumann remains a shareholder of WeWork, but he is far removed from the company. As part of a 2021 deal with SoftBank, when they bought more of his shares, he was not allowed to participate in board meetings, one of the people with knowledge of the situation said. The next year, he was allowed to ask SoftBank whether he or a designee could return to the board as an observer. He hasn't asked to return.

A Casual Guide to Paris Shopping

Paris is a city of easy pleasures. Wine, cheese, croissants. What’s not to love? Isn’t that what Netflix built the popularity of the très unrealistic “Emily in Paris” on? Except the thing about Paris is that it seems like a foolproof place, but it’s not. Rather, it is a city that rewards research.
Prioritize idiosyncratic shops. Paris is still the kind of place where you can stumble upon a boutique that sells only gloves or umbrellas. There is nothing better than being able to announce to anyone listening that you got some supple belt or slipper or lamp or toothpaste in Paris.
Definitely check on the hours that shops are open because they can be highly unusual from a New Yorker’s perspective. Some require appointments, but don’t be intimidated by that. Be enticed at the potential, the uniqueness, the fun.
Strategize your day by neighborhood groupings. In the morning, go to a few stores around, say, Place Vendôme, capped off with a lazy lunch and some of the all-time great people-watching at Hotel Costes. (A fun game: “Is that his daughter or his girlfriend?”) If you’re a real demon, move on to another neighborhood. Otherwise take a nap, then go to a small museum like Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, which is like entering into a Wes Anderson film set.
Paris has many of the same designer boutiques as New York and other large cities, so you might skip them. However! Between the exchange rate and the VAT return (aka, tax refund), designer goods can be significantly cheaper. You’ll need your passport in store. At the airport, remember to scan the forms or have them stamped before you check in and go through customs, as sometimes they ask to see the goods in person. Basically, this is a crucial way to justify buying things.
Resee
This is an online consignment store, but you can make an appointment and send links of what you like, then try it all on at its showroom. Allow Matt, who runs the showroom, to bring you a coffee, and try on a Jil Sander paisley dress from when Raf Simons was the designer or an ivory Chanel jacket like the one in “The Devil Wears Prada” or a ruffled Prada blouse consigned by Catherine Deneuve.
Le Bon Marché
All grand (and less than grand) department stores owe their existences to this place. Émile Zola used it as the setting for “The Ladies Paradise,” in 1883. Here’s how I navigate it. I go to the lingerie-swimwear section. The Empreinte lingerie brand for large busts and plus sizes is hard to find in the United States but has the most comfortable and beautiful collections.
The second floor has a beauty section for niche brands, where you can buy hair masks and dental floss from brands you’ve never heard of. Then do a loop of the designer collections as an overview to see which ones speak to you. Go to, say, Dries Van Noten for an immersive experience. Go to the Buly counter for souvenirs, like a lip balm that comes in a box that can be embossed with initials. Buy snacks at the food hall across the street, which sells things like carrot-passion fruit jam and has at least three aisles dedicated to yogurt. Open Sundays!
Sabbia Rosa
If your ideal look is ’90s off-duty supermodel, this is your heaven. There are exquisite but extremely expensive handmade slips here. Everything can be custom-made, which is dangerous. Do not skip the satin mule slippers with the bow.
Monoprix
Monoprix is basically the French equivalent of Target. The organic cotton underwear comes in a ribbed culotte — a bikini style — or culotte haute, which is more like granny panties. They’re not dissimilar to the handmade underwear from Zimmerli or Hanro but around five euros. Stock up on Savon de Marseille hand soap and filet à provisions, those net market bags.
Em Archives
This new vintage showroom made a cameo in the Blackbird Spyplane newsletter. On a recent visit, it had at least one oversize Donna Karan blouse, an Hermès blazer, Comme des Garçons flats from 1997 and several pairs of Jil Sander trousers at extremely competitive prices.
Flea Market
There are several flea markets in Paris, but the largest is the Puces de Paris Saint-Ouen at the northern border of the city. The place is gigantic, so you absolutely need some kind of strategy. Choose a category (a friend had great luck looking for antique tablecloths) or pick one area to browse. The Marché Paul Bert Serpette is my favorite and has a mix of furniture and clothes.
Will you find a deal? Maybe. Will you want to buy a chair and ship it home? Absolutely! There are shipping companies on site, or just build it a box and check it as oversize luggage on a flight home. For something easier to take home, De Laurentis has late ’80s and early ’90s European and Japanese minimalist designer clothes, and Chantal has beaded flapper dresses reminiscent of the first Bode women’s collection.
Charvet
Who doesn’t want to authentically dress like Lydia Tár these days? This is a multistory palace of tailoring. Get the slippers, get a striped nightshirt that can be worn as a dress, maybe get a rosette brooch made out of necktie material. Then cross to the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a cocktail. It’s sort of like the Bemelmans Bar of Paris.
La Tuile à Loup
Maybe its stern but direct Instagram bio says it all: “Finest of handmade tableware. MADE IN FRANCE. International shipping available.” Do you want a vase with a jellyfish on it? Or how about a marbled tray? Maybe all you need to know is that Ina Garten was recently photographed there. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Russian Editor Evades Putin’s Censorship

In Russia, where men far outnumber women in political clout, defiant females might seem to stand little chance of making themselves heard.
But don’t tell that to Galina Timchenko, a prominent Russian journalist, chief executive of the alternative news site Meduza and recipient of the 2022 Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists. Timchenko has spent more than 20 years battling attacks on free speech by President Vladimir Putin and his Kremlin allies.
Like many activists worldwide, Timchenko and her colleagues at Meduza are growing ever more adept at combining new technology and old-fashioned shoe leather to report on their country without censorship.
“In 2021, when the authorities labeled us ‘foreign agent,’ we understood that’s just the beginning of a major attack, and started preparing for the worst,’’ Timchenko said in a video conversation.
When Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and the Meduza website was blocked in Russia, “we already had eight platforms: two email newsletters, a Telegram channel, Facebook page, podcast, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram. And the most important thing was that we upgraded our mobile application with built-in mechanisms of bypassing blocking. We even launched a promo campaign, “‘Download our mobile app before it’s too late!’”
Timchenko founded Meduza after being fired as chief editor of Lenta.ru, a major Russian news portal, in 2014, the year of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
She put the newsroom and herself out of Putin’s reach in Riga, the capital of Russia’s small Baltic neighbor Latvia.
Back then she had lined up financing within a week. But now, in 2023, maintaining investments is difficult, she said, as Russians who support Meduza could face prison.
“Russian propaganda has enormous financial sources, and what do we have really?” she asked. “A little crowdfunding campaign by people of goodwill around the world, and some support from international organizations. And the Kremlin has billions of dollars to hire people and to spread this disinformation.”
Being pronounced “foreign agents” has made it even more difficult for reporters to get sources to talk to them, she said. And when they do, many of their sources speak only on the condition of anonymity.
Covering Ukraine has been a challenge. Once, she said, they had their own correspondents. Now, after war erupted, they have only freelancers, as Ukraine requires Russian nationals to have visas issued in Russia, and reporters, facing up to 10 years in prison under censorship laws, are loath to return there.
Even without the wartime restrictions and ongoing censorship, reporting in Russia is difficult for women. Men in Russia’s masculine media world, she said, can go to a sauna, drink vodka and cut backroom deals. “It’s impossible to invite me to a sauna,” she chuckled.
She was able to get around the limitations, she said, by being “absolutely inflexible.” There were, she said, “no concessions with all these Kremlin men.”
Still, she recalled a 2010 media conference. “All major newspapers and internet resources were headed by women: Forbes, Vedomosti, even the state-owned RIA Novosti, New Times, Lenta.
“That was one of the greatest moments of Russian media history.” All of those women have since been fired, she said. “They shot us one by one.”
Was there something in a Soviet upbringing that made women particularly suited to this kind of work?
“I hate to say this, but there were more rights for women in the Soviet Union than after the Soviet Union,” she said. “The usual phrase you heard in the Soviet school was: ‘You are a girl, you take responsibility!’ All representatives in student bodies were girls. And after perestroika everything changed: Girls became dolls.”
Timchenko, 60, the daughter of a prominent Moscow doctor, surprised her family by quitting medical studies right before graduation. She has a daughter and a grandson. She spends her days, she said, dealing with “meetings and documents, documents and meetings,” referring to paperwork. In the evening, she works with numbers, she said, “because I’m very fond of stats and analytics.”
“And now we are actually in the process of relocation of part of our team.”
At the war’s start, she said, 25 staff members and their families were evacuated from Moscow. “So now we want to relocate them to Berlin, around 10 people, and partly to Amsterdam, around six to eight people,” she said.
“We realized you cannot count on just one single government, and Latvia is in a very difficult position toward Russia. So we decided to spread Meduza subsidiaries all across Europe. It will be Riga, Berlin and Amsterdam. Yes, newsrooms will be in all three places so if one of them is under attack, the others should continue.”
The site has news, analyses, features and blogs. Its daily Ukraine coverage is headlined War, an obvious rebuttal to the Kremlin’s insistence that the invasion is merely a “special military operation.” Its podcast is “The Naked Pravda.” It advertises itself as “The Real Russia. Today.”
Timchenko does, of course, have her critics. The head of the official League for a Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina said that despite being banned and blocked, Meduza keeps on disseminating “disinformation and outright lies” about Russia.
But Kirill Rogov, a prominent Russian political expert now in exile and director of the online project Re: Russia, told The New York Times: “I think one of Russia’s major problems is that media managers like Galina Timchenko don’t become politicians.”
Timchenko is not optimistic that the war will end soon. She recently gave a phone interview to Evgenia Albats, another prominent Russian journalist living in exile. “And she said: ‘So, Galya, let’s meet next year in Moscow!’ I said: ‘No way. Be prepared for a very long winter.’”
“My feeling is that these guys,” she said, meaning Putin and his allies, “they stole our past.” People can no longer “spend nights with our friends, discussing something, singing, drinking and having fun.
“Now we are representatives of an aggressor country,” she said. “So we are like German people in the 1940s.”
Meduza reports that it has more than 10 million unique web visitors, the majority of whom are readers younger than 45.
“They are those who will live after Putin,” Timchenko said. “To think that I have potentially 25 million politically motivated people who could be our ambassadors, our evangelists and our interpreters to connect with other people.”
Above all, she said, her goal is “absolute freedom of information. I just want all the sources, all the media, on all the platforms to be unblocked.
“Even if everything is open, it’s not guaranteed that people will understand everything, or will share our views.”
But, she said, “I hate these bans on spreading information, news and so on. I want Russian internet to be unblocked, information to flow freely and without any censorship.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

WeWork, the troubled office space company built by entrepreneur Adam Neumann that has struggled to right itself in recent years, is in talks with investors to restructure its outstanding debt of more than $3 billion and raise more cash.
An infusion of cash would most likely give WeWork the hundreds of millions of dollars it needed to keep operating for at least a few years, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations. And restructuring its debt would give executives some leeway to continue reshaping the company without having to worry about running out of funds.
Yardi, a real estate software provider in Santa Barbara, California, is among the investors considering new investment in the company, the people said. Yardi has already been working closely with WeWork as it expands beyond offering coworking spaces to additional services like software for office management at its properties.
There is no guarantee that the WeWork deal will close, and even if it does, it could be weeks away, one of the people said.
The moves to overhaul WeWork’s debt come after the company burned through more than $700 million of cash last year. Still, the company’s performance has gradually improved.
And the company’s talks with investors underscore the continuing challenges to its business, which involves leasing office space from landlords and then charging customers to use it.
SoftBank, the Japanese investment conglomerate that is both WeWork’s largest shareholder and its largest creditor, is playing a key role in the negotiations. It is not expected, however, to put any additional money into the company, the people said. Since 2017, SoftBank has poured more than $10 billion into WeWork and written off billions of dollars in losses on its investment.
SoftBank recently took more steps to shore up WeWork’s financial footing. It lent WeWork $250 million in January, and last month agreed to increase the size of a debt facility and extended the date at which it had to be paid back to March 2025 from November this year.
In addition to SoftBank’s efforts, the deal under discussion will give WeWork the breathing room to focus on improving its performance and growing the company, which involves finding areas to cut costs. In January, WeWork said it would cut 300 employee positions.
Sandeep Mathrani, a veteran of the real estate industry who took over as CEO in February 2020, has been working to improve the company’s financials — a task made easier as office occupancy, which was hit hard during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, ticked higher in the last quarter of 2022.
Last month, in a call with Wall Street analysts, Mathrani raised the possibility of a debt restructuring, saying that the company expected to work toward extending the dates by which its debt must be paid back. But the urgency to lighten its debt load may have increased as WeWork grapples with headwinds in its business.
Founded in 2010 in New York, WeWork, once a darling of the startup world, has since become a cautionary tale. Neumann positioned WeWork as a technology-enabled company that transcended the traditional real estate business. It was a pitch that charmed well-known investors, such as Benchmark Capital, Fidelity and SoftBank, and convinced them to invest at valuations more akin to high-growth technology companies than real estate ones.
At its peak, WeWork was valued at $47 billion in early 2019, before it sought to go public. But Neumann’s ambitions came hurtling to the ground as WeWork’s losses mounted. The company failed to convince investors to buy into its planned initial public offering, forcing it to cancel those plans.
In September 2019, Neumann gave up the CEO role. SoftBank spent billions of dollars to rescue the company — which was in danger of running out of cash before the end of that year — and buy out shareholders, including Neumann. The deal to save WeWork came with massive layoffs.
Things only worsened in 2020 when the pandemic shuttered offices and forced employees to work from home and away from WeWork’s Instagram-ready rental spaces. The company’s customers abandoned their memberships in droves.
At the time, WeWork said going public would provide new capital to grow the company while it cut costs by renegotiating its leases. It finally went public in October 2021, one of the many companies that did so by merging with a special purpose acquisition company.
But the company’s value has continued to decline as it burns through cash. At the end of last year, WeWork had $287 million of cash, down from $924 million at the end of 2021. In the fourth quarter, WeWork said it lost $568 million as it juggled pricey leases while selling customers on new products, such as office management software. It ended 2022 with $15.6 billion of lease obligations and more than $3 billion of borrowings weighing down its balance sheet.
The company’s stock price shows just how nervous investors have been about its fate and its debt coming due over the next few years, most of which is owed to SoftBank. WeWork’s shares have hovered around $1, down roughly 90% from its stock price when the company went public.
In the meantime, Neumann walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars. He is now running a new real estate startup called Flow with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, the prominent venture firm.
Neumann remains a shareholder of WeWork, but he is far removed from the company. As part of a 2021 deal with SoftBank, when they bought more of his shares, he was not allowed to participate in board meetings, one of the people with knowledge of the situation said. The next year, he was allowed to ask SoftBank whether he or a designee could return to the board as an observer. He hasn’t asked to return. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A New Dashboard Simplifies Family Travel: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Department of Transportation is launching a new online resource for travelers to see which airlines guarantee seating families with children age 13 and under together.
The Department of Transportation is introducing an online dashboard that will allow passengers to identify which U.S. airlines will seat children 13 and younger next to an accompanying adult at no extra cost. It is the latest attempt by the Biden administration to pressure airlines to reduce airline fees for everything from seating to reimbursement after flight delays.
The creation of the dashboard is in response to complaints that the D.O.T. has received from travelers who say they have been seated apart from their children, some as young as 11 months.
The new dashboard would help passengers see which airlines actually guarantee family seating while the D.O.T. works on a rule that would ban charging families more to sit together. For airlines to receive a green check on the dashboard, they must guarantee that parents or an accompanying adult can sit next to their children for free if the seats are available.
"Parents traveling with young kids should be able to sit together without an airline forcing them to pay junk fees," said Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, in a statement, adding that the department had been pressing airlines to make those guarantees. "All airlines should do this promptly, even as we move forward to develop a rule establishing this as a requirement across the board."
In an announcement on Monday, the D.O.T. added that the new dashboard would allow parents to sidestep "confusing claims" on family seating policies and make it easier for passengers to know which airlines had "stepped up." Making the guarantee in their customer service plans also means that if airlines failed to uphold the policy, the D.O.T. could step in to enforce it, the department said.
In recent weeks, airlines have said they would change their policies to help accommodate families. United Airlines announced in February that it would allow children under 12 to sit next to accompanying adults at no extra cost, and updated the seat map technology on its online booking system to allow families to more easily find adjacent seats. If no adjacent seats are available, passengers can rebook on a different flight for free.
Frontier Airlines also announced that it had been making efforts to ensure its system would automatically assign at least one parent a seat with their children under 14. And American Airlines said that it had updated its customer service plan in February to guarantee that children under 15 will sit with accompanying adults for free, and offer travelers free rebooking or a refund if the seating wasn't available.
Southwest Airlines said in a statement that it did not charge a fee for seat assignments and offered a service for families to choose their preferred seats during boarding.
The changes come after the Department of Transportation said that in a review begun last year it found that no airline guaranteed seating families together for free, though many airlines said they would make their best efforts. The Biden administration is now planning legislation that would legally enshrine family seating.
In February, a group of Democratic senators introduced the Families Fly Together Act, which would require every airline to seat children 13 and under next to an accompanying adult without a surcharge.
In the meantime, the administration appears to be using dashboards as a way to urge airlines to publicly declare their commitments to their passengers. A similar dashboard, introduced in August, allowed passengers to see which airlines guaranteed services like meals or accommodations when flights were delayed or canceled for reasons under an airline's control. The department said that the dashboard compelled 10 U.S. airlines to explicitly guarantee meals and rebooking services, and nine to guarantee accommodations. Many airlines, however, said that they already had such policies in place or made small tweaks to existing services to meet the standard for a green check.
The push for air travel reform from the administration follows a spate of public fiascos. In January, a Federal Aviation Administration system outage grounded domestic flights in the country for 90 minutes and caused disruptions throughout the day. And in December, a winter storm left thousands of passengers stranded by bad weather. The situation was compounded for Southwest Airlines passengers after the airline's inadequate computer systems led to what analysts called the airline's largest operational meltdown in its five-decade history.

Longer Stays in Ukraine's Animal Shelters: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The first thing you hear after entering the animal sanctuary in Znesinnya Park near the center of Lviv are the dogs. There are scores of them barking and howling, members of a raucous makeshift orchestra sounding out a discordant opera.
They are orphans of war, rescued from bombed-out cities or left by refugees who were uprooted from their homes and unable to care for their pets anymore.
Their residence now is a hulking shed, previously abandoned, that has been hastily outfitted with rows of wooden and metal cages, castoff blankets and towers of bagged pet food.
Orest Zalypskyi started Domivka: Home of Rescued Animals five years ago primarily to care for endangered and injured wild creatures: foxes that were used to train hunting dogs and had their claws and teeth removed, a circus monkey about to be euthanized, an owl with a clipped wing.
But since the Russians invaded last year, Domivka has also become a center for rescued pets -- dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, lambs and birds. Before the war, the sanctuary contained roughly 200 animals. Now, it has more than 500.
"We didn't have any place for them," said Viktoria Stasiv, a volunteer. "It was crazy." They rushed to put together the dog kennel in an old brick and concrete shed that had been used for trash.
At a different site, about an hour away, are 170 sheep, goats and llamas that Domivka volunteers are caring for on a plot of donated land. The animals belonged to a petting zoo in Zaporizhzhia that had to be abandoned.
Over the past year, the group has hosted thousands of animals, Mr. Zalypskyi said.
There was a brief period last spring, after the war began, when animal owners and rescuers were allowed to take animals across the border into other European countries without the usual requirements for things like vaccinations. Busloads of volunteers from Germany and Poland came and took dogs, rabbits and cats back with them. Nearly 5,500 pets were rescued and found new homes outside Ukraine; another 1,500 were adopted inside the country.
But now, adoptions have slowed. Anyone outside Ukraine who wants to liberate a pet from the misery of war has to pay about 200 euros and pick it up. When it comes to dogs, most people want puppies, Ms. Stasiv said, but most of the abandoned dogs are older and bigger. Some are injured.
Chip, a sweet-faced mutt, arrived from Kherson, a heavily besieged city 560 miles away, where he was blinded during an attack. Bonie, a large black dog with tan paws and snout, has a steel rod in his back after his spine was broken in a shelling. Lina Brithna, a rehabilitation worker, is helping him learn to walk again. Zubik, a black and white part-malamute, lost one of his front legs.
There are a couple of puppies that were found in a trash can in Lviv. They are kept in a small indoor shelter along with other injured animals and recent arrivals that are quarantined for their first two weeks. They scamper around Ms. Brithna as she cleans their cages. The cats watch, occasionally poking their paws through holes in the plexiglass doors, and wait their turn.
All the dogs are taken for walks three times a day along the snowy grounds -- by volunteers, visiting families and sometimes former owners, who would love to keep their pets but are themselves refugees and can't provide a home.
Domivka did not previously have a website, but with so many more animals under its care, the nonprofit is now fund-raising on Facebook and Instagram. Over Christmas it sold branded calendars that featured longtime residents and war evacuees, including a white-tipped eagle named Galya.
This small shelter in a Lviv park is one of several domestic and international organizations, like U-Hearts Foundation, UAnimals and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, working to help feed and care for animals during the war.
The shelter needs more staff, enclosures and food, Mr. Zalypskyi said through a translator. "The needs are growing every day as the number of animals increase."
Yurii Shyvala contributed reporting.

A Season For Intimate Encounters: [Style Desk]

Full text: Dries Van Noten and Olivier Rousteing of Balmain get personal.
PARIS -- For so long (even, maybe especially, after the brief Covid hiatus) so much of fashion has been focused on being big -- big shows, big sets, big stars, big followings, big growth -- that to talk about intimacy, about being small, can seem new.
It's not, of course: The clothes we put on, which literally touch our skin, have always been among our most personally resonant belongings, repositories of individual history, even as they also make public statements. It's just that recently the public statements (or made-for-selfie statements) have been so overwhelming that they tended to drown out any other idea.
Yet there they were, both Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, a brand built on Kardashian and Jenner-size ambition and bombast, and Dries Van Noten, king of the emotive gesture, name-checking the preciously personal.
Intimacy with clothing is the emotional flip side of the popular term "wearable," which is fast going from being a synonym for boring to a laudable adjective suggestive of smart thinking about daily life. It started in New York with Proenza Schouler, continued in Milan at Prada and Bottega Veneta. So the fashion hamster wheel turns.
Maybe it has to do with the general horror at megalomania and global domination -- by companies or countries. Maybe it's social media fatigue. Maybe it has to do with an appreciation of the human, in the face of war. There's a lot of grimness so far in Paris fashion; a lot of black and gray on the runway, creating a sense of looming austerity. At Undercover, Jun Takahashi even included little skeletal hands on his suiting, like phantoms rising from the grave (also the lyrics, from The Specials' 1980 cover version of the 1949 song "Enjoy Yourself": "Enjoy yourself/It's later than you think," scripted on the backs of jackets).
Or maybe that's all over-egging it and it's just about self-justification. Maybe a better way of thinking about intimacy: the return is another way of talking about sustainability, which has otherwise unfortunately disappeared from the fashion conversation (possibly because the environmental impact of brands is being considered in actual practice, though by all reports not as effectively as needed). Still, it's increasingly clear there's a divide between those paying lip service to an idea and those actually thinking it through.
Or, in Mr. Van Noten's case, designing it through. His guiding principle being that clothes should be valued and loved until they are worn out -- and then repaired and loved some more. That they should not be disposable. That in not just the making, but the wearing, they contain volumes.
Designers tend to go on and on about the touch of the hand and the value of artisanal creation, and those have meaning, unquestionably. It's part of what you pay for when you buy high-end fashion. What they talk about less is what happens after, when the clothes become part of a life. Yet that may be the most priceless part of the experience, and that's what Mr. Van Noten was honoring.
"For me, it's really the opposite of wanting to show off with the garments," he said backstage in the gargantuan amphitheater where he held his show. "It's really things which for you personally are important." Or become personally important.
That meant a focus, above all, on fabrics: rich and plain, masculine and feminine, tough and fragile. A bit of silk, handwoven and hand-painted, patchworked onto the hem of a skirt and then laid under a scrim of chiffon, worn with a gray jacket. Some gold leaf, painted to resemble a corset onto the waist of a camel wool coat. A pinstripe bustier, stitched in gleaming thread and worn with an easy pantsuit, the jacket fraying at the edges. It was make do and mend, the British wartime mantra, dashed with a bit of 1930s drama and raised to the nth degree. Klimtian luxe meets wabi-sabi. Redolent with imagination about how such pieces might be worn.
That's what was missing from the Balmain collection, despite Mr. Rousteing's stated determination to pull back from his megashows.
This time he swapped the stadium of his previous show, which had also involved an appearance by Cher and 7,000 guests (a.k.a., his Balmain army), for 220 guests and a living room setup with low white couches snaking their way around a room. And this time he was talking backstage about a return to original Balmain principles, back in 1945. "I think we are going through a moment in fashion where people need to remember what fashion is about," he said. "It's about quality, it's about timelessness. It's not about hype." That for him, the show and its approach were the start of "a new chapter," the "new me." A focus on craft.
Sounds good. Except that Mr. Rousteing seemed to translate craft as a lot of structure and more than a bit of bling. Just because it comes in a 1950s silhouette (also a theme at Dior), and to the tune of Frank Sinatra crooning a very on-the-nose "My Way," doesn't change the actual effect. Think a quilted, silver shoulder-framing jacket, plunging to the clavicle in front and gleaming with sequins, over cigarette pants. Sweetheart necklines, peplums and full skirts dotted with gobstopper pearls. More pearls -- pearls galore. A tea dress entirely encrusted in rhinestones. Turned out it was the space, not the clothes, that got small.
On Instagram, it was probably fabulous. Close-up, it was blinding.

Artists Find Their Work Copied by Big Brands: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Companies like Marvel and Panini have been accused of stealing illustrations from lesser-known creators who say fighting back often proves futile.
Bobby Rubio did not know why he was being congratulated.
Then he saw it: his "Bolt Hero," with its bulging yellow biceps and glowing blue eyes, wielding both lightning bolts and pigskin behind Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert on a desirable football card.
Instead of being delighted, Rubio was distraught. No one had sought his permission to use the design he often shares on Instagram.
"A character that I put years into creating got stolen without anyone asking my permission," said Rubio, 51, who works as a story supervisor for Paramount Pictures. "How dare you?"
Copying in the creative field is so pervasive that it has worked its way into clichés. Artists are filing lawsuits to challenge what they see as an artificial-intelligence-powered assault on their profession, and the Supreme Court will soon rule on an important copyright case involving an Andy Warhol silk-screen of Prince.
But for the many independent artists who say that work they have posted online -- in hopes of attracting paying gigs, or at least an audience -- has been stolen by powerful companies, seeking redress has led to an uphill battle.
Creative work posted online has become an easy target for theft, artists say. Over the years, they have complained of scammers who made inferior copies of their artisanal items or turned their illustrations into sellable merchandise. Others have assailed big brands for copying their designs; in some cases, artists have sued.
For Rubio, the imitation Bolt Hero was a shock to the conscience.
"Anyone can just take my stuff and make profit off it?" Rubio recalled wondering when he discovered that his fan art -- he grew up in San Diego, where the Chargers played for decades -- had been co-opted for a football card of Herbert.
As soon as an original work becomes "fixed" -- written, drawn or otherwise recorded -- it is protected by copyright, said Laura Heymann, a professor at William & Mary Law School who specializes in intellectual property law. Basic shapes, features and tropes can be used by anyone. But copying a substantial amount of an artist's creative expression qualifies as infringement.
If two artists create an image of a wolf, for instance, many elements might reasonably look similar, Heymann said. But to Darius Alas, Marvel Studios clearly crossed the line.
Alas, who goes by the artist name Midiankai, last year accused the company of ripping off a wolf drawing he had created for the hard-core band Born From Pain. The band says it paid him and printed shirts featuring the design as merchandise.
Initially, Alas said, he had not thought much of the Marvel art, which his wife had stumbled upon in YouTube advertising for the Disney+ television special "Werewolf by Night." "I'm a small artist," he recalled thinking. "It never crossed my mind that some big company would steal from me."
But when Alas, 35, of Estonia, looked more closely at the Marvel wolf, he realized it included some of his artistic mistakes. The shadows were off in just the same way, and the wolf's nose had nearly identical Christmas-tree-shaped shading running down it.
Alas said his efforts to contact Marvel and Disney were ultimately futile. The most frustrating part of the experience, he said, was reading comments online that praised the art on the Marvel poster. "It's like being in a soundproof glass room," he said. "People walk by, and you scream, but they don't know you exist."
Investigating whether someone was responsible for copying Alas's work offers a glimpse into the tangled online environment that many creators are immersed in.
Marvel Studios said its creative team had worked with an agency that licensed a source image from Shutterstock, a provider of stock photography. The image it cited features a wolf with a barbell between its clenched teeth.
The artist credited with creating the image on Shutterstock -- a "vector contributor" with the user name "Ydhckll" -- did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Shutterstock said that it would investigate the matter and that creators agree to terms of service that make clear they must "have the necessary rights to submit their content."
Shown the Shutterstock image, Alas was clear: "This is my wolf."
Determining who is liable in a case like Alas's would depend in part on what the license agreements say, Heymann said. But she added that "anyone who reproduces or distributes a copyrighted work without authorization is potentially infringing."
"It could be a huge mess," said Kevin M. Casini, an adjunct professor at Quinnipiac University School of Law, who raised another complicating issue: If Alas drew the wolf as work for hire, then the band -- not the artist -- would own the copyright.
Rubio created Bolt Hero, which relies on Chargers themes and motifs, more than a decade ago. The character gained such a following that he said the football team once paid him to draw it on a commemorative poster.
Rubio said that after he posted a tweet with the hashtag #StolenArt, he was contacted by Panini, the company that distributed the football card in question. Panini offered to pay him a nominal rate and credit him on future cards if he agreed to sign paperwork, he said.
Lawyers advised Rubio that winning the case would probably generate only "pocket change," so he decided not to take Panini to court. But he did not sign its paperwork, either.
Panini did not respond to requests for comment. It has since released nearly identical versions of the Chargers card that do not include Bolt Hero.
In a separate case, Rubio discovered that his drawing of the San Diego Padres pitcher Joe Musgrove was being printed on T-shirts without his permission. He said the young artist who had lifted his work then reached out and apologized.
In an interview, the artist, Geoff Recker, said, "I made a mistake, tried to remedy the situation as best I could and move on."
Much like Rubio, who discovered via social media that his art had been hijacked, the freelance artist Kitt Lapeña came to find out through online comments that his drawing of a dragon had appeared, with slight modifications, on a card in the game Magic: The Gathering.
Lapeña, who uses the artist moniker "Scarypet," said he had collected the game's cards for years, and had practiced drawing as a child by filling his sketchbooks with drawings of dragons. He said he had even tried to solicit work from Wizards of the Coast, the game's publisher. So when Lapeña, 39, of the Philippines, saw he was being feted for having his dragon featured on a Magic card, he initially "thought he was being trolled."
After Lapeña tweeted about the situation two years ago, Wizards of the Coast announced it was suspending its relationship with Jason Felix, who drew the card and whose art Lapeña had long admired. A spokeswoman for Wizards said the company had not worked with Felix since.
Felix, who declined to comment, ultimately compensated Lapeña for his work and sent out a public apology. "I was overworked, but that's no excuse. I messed up and I'm trying to make amends," Felix wrote on Twitter. "The artists did not deserve this."
Lapeña emphasized that he held no ill will. In fact, he said, there was one silver lining: He drew a card for Wizards of the Coast that debuted last year.

A Couple's Risqué Posts Test Singapore's Limits When It Comes to Sex: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A couple in Singapore created a Telegram account where they posted risqué content for subscribers. They were convicted of violating nudity and obscenity laws.
The video shows the woman in a spaghetti strap top and very short shorts strolling outside a mall in central Singapore. She looks around to make sure no one can see her. Then she pulls down her top, revealing a breast to her partner, who is filming her.
The woman, Nguyen Thi Anh Thy, and her husband, Jeffrey Chue, say no one saw them make the video in May 2020. A day later, Mr. Chue uploaded it to a private channel he had created on the messaging app Telegram mostly for people who participate in group sex and partner swapping.
Membership in the channel grew, and the video quickly found its way beyond the members -- to the internet.
Two years later, a court in Singapore fined the couple $ 17,000, saying the video as well as other photos of Ms. Nguyen in various states of undress violated the country's laws against nudity and obscenity. The couple was also convicted of providing and abetting false information.
In Singapore, the prosecution made headlines not only for its details but also because it touched on a topic that remains sensitive to many Singaporeans: sex.
Singapore has long imposed numerous restrictions on behavior and expression in pursuit of conservative views of morality as well as an enviable public safety record. But the wealthy city-state has slowly loosened some of those restrictions. In the early 2000s, a ban on oral sex was lifted. Last year, after years of activism and a growing social acceptance of homosexuality, the government repealed a ban on sex between consenting men.
In Asia, Singapore is not an outlier when it comes to nudity and obscenity laws, but it has, in some cases, adopted a strict stance on violations, even when they are done in the confines of one's home. The government does not offer statistics of how many people are prosecuted on similar charges although legal experts say such cases are still rare.
In 2009, a court fined a man $ 1,900 for being naked in his own apartment while in clear view of his neighbors. Last year, the government fined Titus Low, a content creator, $ 2,200 for uploading photos and videos on OnlyFans, a website that offers sexually explicit photos to paying subscribers.
Supporters of Mr. Chue and Ms. Nguyen have questioned why sexual activity between consenting adults is still criminalized. And rights groups have called on the government to use consent as a deciding factor to determine whether sexual acts are illegal.
The couple point out that Singapore allows prostitution in a regulated district, while hundreds of sex workers operate in karaoke bars that are loosely policed. They argue it is hypocritical for the state to go after them when such venues exist.
But Singapore's minister for communications and information, Josephine Teo, said last year, answering a question about OnlyFans, that the government had to "ensure that such content creation platforms do not expose Singaporeans to the risk of exploitation and abuse, especially our youth."
Eugene Tan, an associate professor of law at the Singapore Management University, said, "People might regard Singapore laws as being somewhat prudish, that these people should be free to express themselves." He added, "In Singapore, certainly, we don't regard this as freedom of expression, particularly when it seems to have a negative effect on society's social mores."
After their conviction, Mr. Chue and Ms. Nguyen left for Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, where Ms. Nguyen is from. They say they were unfairly penalized as sexual deviants when all they were doing was exploring an alternative lifestyle consensually.
"We didn't do what we did at the expense of anyone," Mr. Chue said in an interview with The New York Times. "Our point is -- what they've done to us -- do we deserve this?"
Vanessa Ho, the executive director of Project X, an advocacy group that supports sex workers, compared the couple's plight with sex workers who "feel like they have been unfairly portrayed and persecuted as beacons of immorality." She added, "In order to portray a certain sense of morality, you have to police it, and you have to police it in very obvious, sometimes spectacular ways."
Many of the couple's supporters say the case has prompted them to remove their own erotic photos and videos from private websites that cater to people who swap sex partners or engage in group sex.
Ms. Nguyen, 30, the owner of a label-printing company for clothing in Vietnam, said that in 2019, before their marriage the next June, she and her husband joined an online forum -- the Undertable Swingers' Community -- which has more than 50,000 members, based in Singapore. Many members say they quickly became one of the most popular couples on the platform for their daring photos in public spaces.
In March 2020, Mr. Chue, 50, started the Telegram channel, charging $ 19 a month and $ 52 for three months to gain access to the couple's photos. A former chief executive of an international table tennis league, he said he was trying to offset the costs of hosting drinks for people who wanted to meet the couple but would leave without paying their portion of the bill.
At its height, the channel had 320 members.
A few months later, Mr. Chue uploaded the video of Ms. Nguyen outside the mall. Soon, the couple discovered that the clip -- as well as other photos of Ms. Nguyen that the couple had shared in the channel -- was spreading on WhatsApp, Instagram and various public internet forums.
Mr. Chue scrambled to delete the content, but it was too late.
The next day, the front page of the Shin Min Newspaper, a Chinese broadsheet, carried photos of Ms. Nguyen with the headline: "Husband takes nude photos of wife on street." An anonymous person later filed a police report by email, attaching the clip.
Two days later, around 10 officers raided the couple's apartment, they said, and arrested them.
"I was in a complete state of shock," Mr. Chue said.
Prosecutors accused Mr. Chue of using social media "to entice followers" to subscribe to the Telegram channel, which amounts to violating laws on the distribution of "any obscene object."
Lawyers for Mr. Chue called for "the adaptation and evolution of the law" to keep up with "the evolving standards of morality and normalcy" in Singapore. They argued that the pictures should not be considered obscene because they were available only to consenting adults and "must be viewed in the context it was made."
But Mr. Tan, the professor, said paid subscriptions for content would "certainly be regarded as being very much in the public domain."
In October, Mr. Chue and Ms. Nguyen were found guilty. In her ruling, Janet Wang, a district judge, said it was "irrelevant that the platform caters to consenting parties and that the objection lies in the obscene nature of the materials being disseminated."
Mr. Chue acknowledged that he "made a stupid mistake" and that he takes the blame for it.
Last November, the Chues moved to Vietnam, where they are expecting a baby boy in May. Mr. Chue, who is interviewing for jobs, said he had not been able to find employment because of the media coverage of the case.
To pay the fine, the Chues say they had to sell everything. They have no intention of ever returning to Singapore.

A Proposal, and a Wedding, Well Suited for TV: [Correction]

Full text: Julio Lopez surprised Marissa LaRochelle, a YouTuber and social media fitness influencer, with a live proposal on "GMA3" -- and, days later, a wedding before 1.6 million.
Not every bride wants a marriage proposal sprung on her on national television. Fewer still might want the wedding staged for a live audience four days later.
But Marissa Dawn LaRochelle, who married Julio Cesar Lopez on the ABC News show "GMA3: What You Need to Know" in front of 1.6 million viewers Feb. 24, had experience taking her private life public before walking down a staged aisle, cameras rolling, in the network's Times Square TV studio.
Ms. LaRochelle, 33, is a fitness content creator known as Marissa Dawn, posting under the handle @70LbsofLife on YouTube and Instagram. In 2016, she started documenting her quest to lose weight and reclaim her health after a diagnosis of early onset diabetes. By the time the producers of "GMA3" reached out this January with an offer to talk about her journey on TV, she had dropped 140 pounds -- nearly half her weight -- and become a certified personal trainer and mindset coach.
Mr. Lopez, 40, knew nothing of the transformation that would one day lead them down an all-expenses paid aisle when they met.
Ms. LaRochelle and Mr. Lopez are both from San Antonio, Texas. Ms. LaRochelle moved there from Colorado as a baby with her parents, Lori and Pete LaRochelle, and brother. Mr. Lopez, an owner of the plumbing company JC & Son Plumbing in San Antonio, was born in Nueva Rosita, a town in the state of Coahuila in northern Mexico, and raised in Texas with his parents, Julio C. and Florinda Lopez, and five siblings.
Tinder brought the couple together in September 2020. Ms. LaRochelle was steadily amassing followers for what was shaping up to be a lasting approach to better health and had recently convinced herself to start dating. Mr. Lopez, who was divorced in 2015 and has two children, ages 13 and 9, didn't know about her social media presence but was attracted to her picture.
When they met for a first date at the Hoppy Monk, a San Antonio bar, relief swept over both. "She looked like she did in her profile, which was amazing because you never know what you're going to get" through dating apps, he said.

She was relieved he was no longer sporting the long beard he wore in some of his Tinder photos. "He was very handsome," she said.
That night, they talked about loose skin. "I wanted to get it out there right away," said Ms. LaRochelle, who had lost enough weight to cause her skin to loosen (she has since had the excess skin removed). "At that point, I was looking for a serious relationship, and I had encountered a few people who weren't attracted to that." It was a conversation Mr. Lopez could have skipped right past: "I was thinking, 'Who cares?"' he said. "We had a connection. That's what I cared about."
A month later, on Halloween, he asked her to be his girlfriend. Two months after that, they quarantined together when both got Covid. "That's the week I fell in love with Julio," Ms. LaRochelle said. "It brought us closer." In the spring of 2021, they moved to a new apartment together in San Antonio.
Ms. LaRochelle's YouTube subscribers knew about him well before he proposed on the air. "I was always raving about Julio, how supportive he is and what an amazing boyfriend" he was, she said. In January, when Ms. LaRochelle told the producers of "GMA3" that they could contact him, she thought the call would be about his role in her health transformation.
But the producers had other ideas. Mr. Lopez said they got straight to the point: "They asked me if I loved Marissa, and I said, 'Yes of course,' and then they go, 'We're looking to marry one lucky couple, we could fly you in and throw the wedding for you guys,"' he said. He was onboard instantly.
For Catherine McKenzie, the show's executive producer, the only wrinkle in the show's first "Wedding in a Week" series came when Ms. LaRochelle paused before saying yes to Mr. Lopez's live Feb. 20 proposal. "My heart was in my chest like, 'Oh, God,"' she said. But Ms. LaRochelle said she just needed a beat to pull herself together before saying yes: "I was thinking, 'I'm either going to laugh or cry or throw up,"' she said.
The show's wedding package included a Neil Lane designed diamond engagement ring from Kay Jewelers and a trip to David's Bridal, which gifted Ms. LaRochelle a wedding gown. Mr. Lopez was whisked to Bloomingdale's, where he was fitted for a custom navy suit.
Their officiant, the relationship adviser DeVon Franklin, a nondenominational Christian minister and New York state marriage officiant, was part of the package, too: Days before the wedding, he got to know the couple on and off the air. "That was a surprise for us," said Ms. LaRochelle, who had followed him online. "I couldn't believe it."
Just seven friends and family members, all flown to New York by ABC, were by the couple's side when they said "I do." As for the other 1.6 million watching from home, "This is great because I do not like stress," Ms. LaRochelle said, adding that wedding planning may have caused some.
For Mr. Lopez, it felt even simpler than that. "Just tell me where to sign," he said.

Staten Island Man Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for Attacks on Jews in 2021 and 2022: [National Desk]

Full text: Saadah Masoud wanted to punish supporters of Israel, prosecutors said. His assaults came amid a rising wave of antisemitism in the United States.
In spring 2021, Saadah Masoud traveled to a pro-Israel rally in Manhattan, asked a man wearing a necklace with a large Star of David whether he was Jewish and then punched him in the face.
About two weeks later, Mr. Masoud, 29, of Staten Island, threatened a Jewish man with whom he had argued previously at a Black Lives Matter event. Then one of Mr. Masoud's associates hit the man. In 2022, Mr. Masoud was at a pro-Palestine march in Manhattan when he assaulted a counterprotester who had an Israeli flag draped over his shoulders like a cape.
On Friday, Mr. Masoud, who pleaded guilty in federal court in November to one count of conspiring to commit hate crimes, was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
Jewish organizations have warned for years about a rise in antisemitism and violence. In 2017, torch-carrying marchers chanted "Jews will not replace us" in Charlottesville, Va. The next year, a man who had posted antisemitic comments on social media fatally shot 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue.
More recently, the musician Kanye West, who goes by "Ye," said on Twitter that he would soon go "death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE," and later posted a Swastika inside a Star of David. Last month, a man who the authorities said had a history of antisemitic conduct was charged with federal hate crimes after shooting and wounding two Jewish men in Los Angeles.
"You are burdened by enormous anger," Judge Denise L. Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan told Mr. Masoud while sentencing him. "You're going to have to confront whatever is in your soul."
Prosecutors had asked that Mr. Masoud receive a sentence of 18 months to two years, writing in a court filing that he had repeatedly engaged in hateful violence toward Jews.
"Each of these assaults was brazen," the prosecutors wrote.
Mr. Masoud's lawyers had sought a six-month sentence. They denied that he was antisemitic and said he had only attacked people whom he knew as outspoken supporters of Israel.
"His conduct toward them would have been the same, no matter the religious faith to which they belonged," the defense lawyers wrote, adding that their client had been "triggered" in part by "constant confrontation with counterprotesters at demonstrations."
Before being sentenced, Mr. Masoud stood and issued apologies to each of his victims, saying he regretted his actions.
"I realize that I have anger issues and I need to work on them," he added.
The first assault at issue in the case occurred in late May 2021, on a day when pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters clashed in Midtown. More than two dozen people were arrested amid the conflict, which was inflamed by days of fighting overseas that resulted in 230 deaths in Gaza and 12 in Israel.
The day before the assault, prosecutors said, Mr. Masoud had taken part in a group chat in which he and others discussed disrupting a pro-Israel rally. Mr. Masoud, prosecutors said, wrote: "VIOLENT!! ONLY VIOLENCE ... IN PALESTINE THEY WISHHH THEY COULD SMACK A ZIONIST AND NOT GET TORTURED TO DEATH. WE CAN THO!!"
At the rally, Mr. Masoud punched the man with the Star of David necklace, who was walking with his wife, according to court papers.
After the assault, prosecutors said, Mr. Masoud exchanged further text messages with his associates, stating: "no videos of me anywhere" and "No face no case."
In June 2021, prosecutors said, Mr. Masoud approached a man who was sitting in a car outside his Brooklyn home. The man, Heshy Tischler, had become known during the pandemic as a supporter of President Donald J. Trump and an opponent of many of the city's coronavirus containment measures.
At the time, Mr. Tischler was running for a City Council seat. He had recently pleaded guilty to inciting a riot in Brooklyn on a night when several people punched and kicked a Jewish journalist whom Mr. Tischler had called a "traitor."
According to prosecutors, Mr. Masoud, whom Mr. Tischler had previously identified as having shouted antisemitic insults at him, got out of his car and told him, in effect, "We know where you live. We'll get you."
When Mr. Tischler got out of his car and tried to record with his phone, Mr. Masoud knocked it from his hand and an associate of Mr. Masoud's then punched Mr. Tischler in the face, prosecutors said.
A few days later, prosecutors wrote, Mr. Masoud described the attack in an Instagram direct message, saying, "some jew politician said I assaulted him."
On Friday, Mr. Tischler addressed the court before Mr. Masoud was sentenced, calling him an "evil man" who had showed up at Mr. Tischler's home "to see blood."
The third assault took place in April 2022 when Mr. Masoud participated in a pro-Palestine march in Manhattan and saw a man named Matt Greenman marching alongside the main protest with the flag draped over his back.
Mr. Masoud chased Mr. Greenman and threw him to the ground, prosecutors said. They added that an older woman who was walking with Mr. Greenman had fallen and hurt her leg.
Mr. Masoud "repeatedly punched" Mr. Greenman in the head and face, dragged his face along the sidewalk "and then ripped his Israeli flag from his neck and ran away," prosecutors said. Mr. Greenman, they added, had been treated for a concussion.
When Mr. Masoud was arrested in 2022 and brought to court, prosecutors said, he recognized the case detective and said to him: "All this for one Jew?"

Steve Mackey, 56, Bassist Who Helped Transform the Britpop Band Pulp: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shortly after he joined that long-running group in 1987, it rose from obscurity to chart-topping success in what came to be called the Cool Britannia era.
Steve Mackey, the lauded bassist, songwriter and producer who made his name laying down dance-floor-friendly grooves for the British band Pulp during its 1990s pinnacle, as it transformed itself from a little-known art-rock collective to a festival-headlining Britpop powerhouse, died on Thursday. He was 56.
His death was announced on social media by his wife, Katie Grand. She did not say where he died or cite a cause, although she noted that he had died "after three months in hospital, fighting with all his strength and determination."
With Hollywood-worthy looks and an image of tailored cool, Mr. Mackey provided the pulsing bass lines that helped whip audiences into a frenzy as Pulp cycled through glam-rock, acid-house, disco and indie-pop influences on 1990s anthems like "Common People" and "Disco 2000," two of the five Top 10 singles the band notched in Britain.
Pulp also had five Top 10 albums, including the celebrated "Different Class" in 1995.
Mr. Mackey recorded five studio albums with Pulp over the course of a decade, starting with "Separations" in 1992. His tenure coincided with the most commercial and critically acclaimed era for this long-running, ever-evolving band, as it emerged from obscurity in Sheffield, England, and, after a series of false starts, took its place in the English pop firmament along with Oasis, Blur and other supernovas of the so-called Cool Britannia era.
In 1995, the influential British music magazine Melody Maker anointed Pulp the band of the year -- a notable accomplishment in a year that also saw the release of Oasis's era-defining album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" That same year, the band headlined the star-studded Glastonbury rock festival after the scheduled headliners, the Stone Roses, dropped out.
It was a meteoric rise for a garage-band bassist who had started his association with the band as a mere fan.
Stephen Patrick Mackey was born on Nov. 10, 1966, in Sheffield, a historically industrial city in South Yorkshire, England. He was in his late teens when he started catching gigs by Pulp, which was already a respected band on the local scene.
Jarvis Cocker, the band's lead singer, made an immediate impression with his haunted air and chiseled looks. "I was amazed by Jarvis," Mr. Mackey said in a 2021 video interview. "He was really a striking frontman, and the songs were really powerful; they're quite dark as well."
It was while he was playing in band called Trolley Dog Shag that Mr. Mackey befriended Mr. Cocker, although he did not entertain thoughts of lobbying to play with Pulp. "They seemed self-contained, quite aloof," he said in a 1996 interview for the band's website. "I was into really noisy bands, garage bands, and Pulp were like an art band."
Besides, the band, formed in 1978, hardly seemed on a fast track to stardom. By the time Mr. Mackey joined in 1987, Pulp had cycled through multiple lineups and had failed to generate much of a stir with its first two albums, "It" (1983) and "Freaks" (1986).
The band began developing a more pop-friendly sound, and the first single from "Separations," the ice-cool dance track "My Legendary Girlfriend," finally gave Pulp a taste of mainstream success. The British music newspaper NME named it a "single of the week."
Pulp would continue to chart for the rest of the decade, but disbanded after its 2001 album, "We Love Life." In the ensuing years, Mr. Mackey, who had contributed to the writing of the band's songs along with Mr. Cocker and the other members, kept busy as a producer and songwriter, working with bands like Arcade Fire and Florence + the Machine.
He had a cameo role in the 2005 film "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" as the bassist for a wizard supergroup called Weird Sisters, alongside Mr. Cocker, as well as Jonny Greenwood and Philip Selway of Radiohead.
Mr. Mackey was an avid photographer, and he spun out a side career in the 2010s shooting fashion campaigns for brands like Armani Exchange and Marc Jacobs while collaborating with his wife, a stylist and fashion journalist, on her fashion magazine, Love.
He joined Pulp on a reunion tour in 2011 and 2012, but declined to join one scheduled for this year, explaining on social media last October that he desired "to continue the work I'm engaged in -- music, filmmaking and photography projects."
In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son, Marley; his parents, Kath and Paul; and his sister, Michelle.
After Mr. Mackey's death, Mr. Cocker posted on Instagram a photo of Mr. Mackey trekking up a rocky trail in the Andes in 2012.
"We had a day off & Steve suggested we go climbing in the Andes," Mr. Cocker wrote. Calling it a "magical experience," he continued: "Steve made things happen. In his life & in the band. & we'd very much like to think that he's back in those mountains now, on the next stage of his adventure."

Want More Steals? A Brewers Rookie Is Glad to Oblige.: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Baseball wants more stolen bases, and Garrett Mitchell, a rookie outfielder for the Milwaukee Brewers, is happy to oblige.
PHOENIX -- The fastest man in the major leagues sounded almost embarrassed. Yes, Garrett Mitchell, a rookie center fielder for the Milwaukee Brewers, had a home-to-first sprint speed of 4.01 seconds last season. Yes, that was the fastest time of more than 500 players tracked by Major League Baseball's Statcast system.
No, Mitchell was not impressed.
"To me, that wasn't that fast," Mitchell said while standing by his locker at the Brewers' complex before a game last week. "My fastest time that I've ever had, home to first, was like 3.89 or 3.91. So when people say, 'Hey, you have the fastest time,' I'm like, 'Well, that was kind of slow. I could be a lot faster than that."'
As M.L.B. tries to encourage speed this season, with bigger bases and limits on pickoff throws, players like Mitchell are poised to make an impact. The major league leader in stolen bases last season was Miami's Jon Berti, with 41, far from the record of 130, set by the Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson for Oakland in 1982.
Henderson set the mark in Milwaukee that summer and got a ride to the postgame news conference from John Counsell, who worked for the Brewers. John's 12-year-old son, Craig, hopped onto the golf cart with Henderson. Craig Counsell, now the Brewers' manager, doubts he will recreate that moment with Mitchell -- but he's eager for a running revival.
"The era that we saw, I don't think we'll ever see that again," Counsell said. "But the number for the league leader in stolen bases will be higher this year than it was last year. And I think we can go back to a world where we'll see that player more, for sure. So I think it's a fun thing."
And Mitchell is a fun player, even if he's not the biggest star in his family; his wife, the professional softball player Haley Cruse Mitchell, has more than 850,000 followers on TikTok. She is part of a support system Mitchell credits with helping him thrive despite his Type 1 diabetes, a disease that may have scared off some teams before the 2020 draft.
Mitchell -- who was first diagnosed at age 9 -- hit .349 with 18 steals as a sophomore at U.C.L.A. But he played only 15 games as a junior before the coronavirus pandemic ended the season. With less time to see his skills, the Brewers believe, rival teams may have overemphasized Mitchell's medical condition.
"The Covid draft hurt him some because he couldn't put another full year of really good performance out there," said Tod Johnson, the Brewers' vice president for domestic scouting. "And so, I think that let some people worry more about some of the other things that weren't the performance."
The Brewers -- who are trying to develop position players to match their deep group of homegrown pitchers -- were thrilled that Mitchell fell to them with the 20th overall pick. He made an immediate impression at his first spring training, in 2021, verifying the top-of-the-scale speed grade (the little-used "80") that the Brewers gave him as a prospect.
"You look at him, and he's not a small guy, not somebody you'd expect to run that way," Johnson said of Mitchell, who is 6-foot-3 and 224 pounds. "His first game here, he hit a ground ball to second, and the second baseman had all kinds of time, but you could see him panic when he saw where Garrett was. I don't know if he beat it out or not, but he certainly made that player speed up his game. And that's what he does -- he hits first gear really quick, accelerates from there and just takes off."
Mitchell played only 132 games in the minors, with 34 steals in 37 attempts and a .382 on-base percentage. Promoted to Milwaukee in late August, he batted .311 in 28 games and swiped eight bases without being caught.
"The mind-set I had was like: No one's going to beat me here," Mitchell said. "And it ended up working in my favor, a good amount of the time, which was nice. But it just reminded me about confidence."
Mitchell, 24, has several examples of players with Type 1 diabetes who had substantial major league careers: among others, the list includes the Hall of Famer Ron Santo, the former pitchers Bill Gullickson and Jason Johnson, and the former third baseman Dave Hollins.
Another, Sam Fuld, encouraged Mitchell in a phone call when Mitchell was a top high school prospect in Orange, Calif. As a boy, Fuld had met Gullickson at a game in Boston, and he told Mitchell how the discipline required to manage the disease could actually help him.
"It is a giant pain in the rear end that requires a lot of constant care and maintenance and patience -- but ultimately, if you stay on top of it, you can use it to your advantage, because you are going to be in tune with your body and what you put into it," said Fuld, who is now the general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies.
"And the reality is, it gives you a little bit of a chip on your shoulder, because there still is a stigma attached to the disease, not nearly to the extent that there was 50 years ago, when Ron Santo was playing, but there's still people who have reservations in, say, committing to a professional athlete, or even an amateur athlete, and trusting that that person is going to be able to regulate their blood sugar and be able to stay on the field."
Fuld spent much of his career as a reserve and said the sudden adrenaline rush from being called to pinch hit could sometimes cause his blood-sugar level to spike. He wears a glucose monitor now, but as a player, from 2007 to 2015, he would check his levels by pricking his finger every few innings.
"There's a piece of your brain that's occupied at all times: Where is my blood sugar? What am I eating? What was my exercise in the last 24 hours?" Fuld said. "You know, all these variables that affect your levels and your management. More than anything, it's like a constant stress that exists, and there's just no running from it."
While an estimated 27 million adults in the United States have Type 2 diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 1.6 million or so have been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that requires insulin as treatment. Mitchell keeps an insulin pump -- about half the size of a cellphone -- in his back left pocket during every game. The device serves the same purpose as shots, pumping insulin from a cartridge through a tube and into his body. Mitchell said he changes the infusion site every three days with a poke in his backside.
The disease, Mitchell knows, is part of his identity, and he is so open about it that he lists "Type 1 Diabetic," along with his team name and a Bible verse, atop his Twitter and Instagram pages. He wants to inspire fans with more than his speed.
"I love meeting kids off the field who are diabetic -- like, 'Hey, Garrett! I'm Type 1! Type 1 Warrior,"' Mitchell said. "Things like that, it's really cool."

NEW YORK — In spring 2021, Saadah Masoud traveled to a pro-Israel rally in Manhattan, asked a man wearing a necklace with a large Star of David whether he was Jewish and then punched him in the face.
About two weeks later, Masoud, 29, of Staten Island, threatened a Jewish man with whom he had argued previously at a Black Lives Matter event. Then one of Masoud’s associates hit the man. In 2022, Masoud was at a pro-Palestine march in Manhattan when he assaulted a counterprotester who had an Israeli flag draped over his shoulders like a cape.
On Friday, Masoud, who pleaded guilty in federal court in November to one count of conspiring to commit hate crimes, was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
Jewish organizations have warned for years about a rise in antisemitism and violence. In 2017, torch-carrying marchers chanted “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville, Virginia. The next year, a man who had posted antisemitic comments on social media fatally shot 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue.
More recently, musician Kanye West, who goes by “Ye,” said on Twitter that he would soon go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE,” and later posted a swastika inside a Star of David. Last month, a man who authorities said had a history of antisemitic conduct was charged with federal hate crimes after shooting and wounding two Jewish men in Los Angeles.
“You are burdened by enormous anger,” Judge Denise L. Cote of U.S. District Court in Manhattan told Masoud while sentencing him. “You’re going to have to confront whatever is in your soul.”
Prosecutors had asked that Masoud receive a sentence of 18 months to two years, writing in a court filing that he had repeatedly engaged in hateful violence toward Jews.
“Each of these assaults was brazen,” the prosecutors wrote.
Masoud’s lawyers had sought a six-month sentence. They denied that he was antisemitic and said he had only attacked people whom he knew as outspoken supporters of Israel.
“His conduct toward them would have been the same, no matter the religious faith to which they belonged,” the defense lawyers wrote, adding that their client had been “triggered” in part by “constant confrontation with counterprotesters at demonstrations.”
Before being sentenced, Masoud stood and issued apologies to each of his victims, saying he regretted his actions.
“I realize that I have anger issues and I need to work on them,” he added.
The first assault at issue in the case occurred in late May 2021, on a day when pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters clashed in Midtown. More than two dozen people were arrested amid the conflict, which was inflamed by days of fighting overseas that resulted in 230 deaths in Gaza and 12 in Israel.
The day before the assault, prosecutors said, Masoud had taken part in a group chat in which he and others discussed disrupting a pro-Israel rally. Masoud, prosecutors said, wrote: “VIOLENT!! ONLY VIOLENCE … IN PALESTINE THEY WISHHH THEY COULD SMACK A ZIONIST AND NOT GET TORTURED TO DEATH. WE CAN THO!!”
At the rally, Masoud punched the man with the Star of David necklace, who was walking with his wife, according to court papers.
After the assault, prosecutors said, Masoud exchanged further text messages with his associates, stating: “no videos of me anywhere” and “No face no case.”
In June 2021, prosecutors said, Masoud approached a man who was sitting in a car outside his Brooklyn home. The man, Heshy Tischler, had become known during the pandemic as a supporter of President Donald Trump and an opponent of many of the city’s coronavirus containment measures.
At the time, Tischler was running for a City Council seat. He had recently pleaded guilty to inciting a riot in Brooklyn on a night when several people punched and kicked a Jewish journalist whom Tischler had called a “traitor.”
According to prosecutors, Masoud, whom Tischler had previously identified as having shouted antisemitic insults at him, got out of his car and told him, in effect, “We know where you live. We’ll get you.”
When Tischler got out of his car and tried to record with his phone, Masoud knocked it from his hand and an associate of Masoud’s then punched Tischler in the face, prosecutors said.
A few days later, prosecutors wrote, Masoud described the attack in an Instagram direct message, saying, “some jew politician said I assaulted him.”
On Friday, Tischler addressed the court before Masoud was sentenced, calling him an “evil man” who had showed up at Tischler’s home “to see blood.”
The third assault took place in April 2022 when Masoud participated in a pro-Palestine march in Manhattan and saw a man named Matt Greenman marching alongside the main protest with the flag draped over his back.
Masoud chased Greenman and threw him to the ground, prosecutors said. They added that an older woman who was walking with Greenman had fallen and hurt her leg.
Masoud “repeatedly punched” Greenman in the head and face, dragged his face along the sidewalk “and then ripped his Israeli flag from his neck and ran away,” prosecutors said. Greenman, they added, had been treated for a concussion.
When Masoud was arrested in 2022 and brought to court, prosecutors said, he recognized the case detective and said to him: “All this for one Jew?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Bored, Naïve, And Now She's Prey: [Review]

Full text: Lily McInerny stars as a 17-year-old girl who is groomed by a predator in Jamie Dack's feature debut.
It starts with a wink at a diner. When the 17-year-old, Lea (Lily McInerny), the heroine of "Palm Trees and Power Lines" sees it -- or maybe just the man delivering it -- her world falls off its axis. The wink flusters Lea; it also apparently primes her. So when the guy later rolls up next to her while she's walking home, his mouth and engine both running, she responds to his attention, somehow oblivious to the Klaxon horns of warning shrieking in the viewer's head.
Directed by Jamie Dack, who shares screenplay credit with Audrey Findlay, "Palm Trees" tracks the bleak, depressing story of Lea, who falls for the wrong guy only to tumble headlong into the abyss. Set in an especially cheerless pocket of Southern California, where high-voltage lines loom over the sparsely treed landscape, it opens in the summer. Lea is on a break and conspicuously bored. Under the inattentive watch of her single mom (Gretchen Mol, doing what she can), Lea drifts through the days and nights, sunbathing in her yard and hanging out with friends. She gets high, hooks up and so it sluggishly goes.
Everything shifts when the diner guy rolls into her life. He calls himself Tom (Jonathan Tucker), although once he gets talking it's hard to believe anything that he says. Lea, though, is nothing if not credulous, and after jokingly ordering him not to murder her, she climbs in his truck next to him. She awkwardly lights a cigarette, he asks for a drag, the camera framing their hands hovering near each other. Lea and Tom chat, and her wariness soon eases, his flirting and her interest warming the cab. They keep chatting, she asks his age -- he's 34 -- and by the time that he drops her off, Lea is a goner and the story is on its way.
Ambitious, torpid, wildly overlong and frustratingly underdeveloped, "Palm Trees" follows Lea as she falls for Tom, who turns out to be as awful -- and as much a near-parody of villainy -- as his clichéd smooth talk. He's less overtly sleazy and certainly less well-written than the pimp played by Harvey Keitel in "Taxi Driver," but Tom's moves and words come right from the same predator playbook. Unfortunately, and curiously for a 21st-century sentient teenager with a phone in her back pocket, Lea seems not to have watched a single movie, television show, newscast, Instagram story or viral TikTok about human trafficking.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It would be easier to believe Lea's sorry tale, her naïveté and spiraling trajectory, if she had more of a discernible personality. McInerny gives the character a convincing physical diffidence, a droopy reserve that, by turns, registers as shyness, apathy and self-protectiveness, and which can make this slight, already young-looking performer look even younger than her character's age. But Lea's personality is as lacking in expressive detail as her bland house and cramped world, and she rarely comes persuasively alive and then not for long, which might be interesting if it seemed intentional. Instead, too often, she is a narratively convenient blank.
That's a problem for a movie about sexual agency and sexual exploitation. Dack rightly doesn't pass judgment on Lea, and she remains on the character's side throughout. But because she never gets in the teen's head and even seems oddly incurious about the girl's inner life, she fails to adequately engage with questions of sexual consent, free will and whether Lea's choices (or those of any underage child) are truly her own. Dack takes obvious care to make sure that the filmmaking and camerawork don't further exploit the character. Yet it's a bummer that the ethical and political thoughtfulness that she extends during Lea's most harrowingly vulnerable moments doesn't extend to the rest of the movie.

Readers Recommend Their Favorite Cozy Restaurants: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: We asked for recommendations, and you delivered.
In anticipation of a frigid winter that never quite panned out, I wrote about cozy dining in late December. You know those restaurants, the ones that make you feel as if you've been spirited away to a quieter part of New York City reserved just for you and yours.
In the same dispatch, I asked for your own recommendations and, let me say, in nearly a year of writing this newsletter I've never received such an enthusiastic response. With this week shaping up to be a little cooler, if not downright cold, I thought I'd provide a grand survey of what cozy means to you all, my incredible readers.
Greenwich Village Was Built for This
No particular neighborhood seems to have a corner on the homey market, but one area kept popping up: Greenwich Village. As one of Manhattan's oldest landmark historic districts, it has always had a head start on Old World charm.
Joe D. shared that his family has been dining at Piccolo Angolo, at the corner of Hudson and Jane Streets, for 25 years. "My brother came upon this little place soon after it opened and it has become -- for us and its devotees -- like a family dining room," he wrote, adding that it's "intimate and never loud." It mixes the old and the new: Wild boar ragù sits right next to vegan asparagus ravioli on the menu. Bruno M. asked me to consider Oscar's Place, a British-Belgian restaurant, also on Hudson Street, that he called his "idea of cozy." It's beloved for its fish and chips and full English breakfast.
Another reader, Donna A., flagged the French restaurant La Sirène, on Broome Street. Her order: French onion soup and a glass of red wine. It "screams -- OK, whispers -- cozy when temperatures drop," she wrote.
You could be convinced that the French invented cozy from the many, many emails pointing me toward restaurants of that ilk: Le Fond in Greenpoint; La Bonne Soupe and Deux Amis in Midtown; Le Gigot in the West Village; Le Parisien in Kips Bay; the Odeon in TriBeCa; and two votes for Chez Napoléon in Hell's Kitchen. ("Small, quiet and wonderful old-fashioned French cuisine," Jane D. wrote.)
For New Yorkers, Comfort Means Pasta
As I've reported before, we know that New Yorkers are obsessed with French food. The only close second? Italian. Adam S. recommended Mario's, a 104-year-old red sauce restaurant on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, where his family celebrates "all occasions, birthdays and anniversaries, and lots in between" in a "homey and warm" environment.
Farther south, in the shadow of Carmine's, on the Upper West Side, is the newish, bookshelf-lined Italian restaurant Osteria Accademia, on Amsterdam Avenue. Vicki W. wrote, "The overall effect is of a library, but not too dark and it keeps the noise of this small room under nice control." Her favorites include the fennel salad with oranges and pistachios, the tabliolini neri and all the fish dishes. At Trattoria Dell'Arte, near Carnegie Hall, you'll find Tom P. He said that the upstairs dining room, with its portraits of famous noses, is good for "whispered conversations away from the boisterous space below" and "secret assignations." You do you, Tom P.!
I'd travel far and wide for a good meal in a lovely space, but I always come home to roost in Brooklyn. So, I think I'll spend my next late-winter evening in Brooklyn Heights per a recommendation from Steve M., who would rather go out to eat than "mess up a perfectly clean kitchen," which is so, so real. He usually goes for the Italian restaurant Noodle Pudding, on Henry Street.
"The food is fresh and well prepared and the overall feel is 'Cheers'-friendly and welcoming," he wrote. And with nary a website or Resy page and no signage, it's truly hidden away. All that, and the lamb Bolognese, sound like just my cup of tea.

This week, Pete Wells reviewed Torrisi Bar & Restaurant, the latest New York City restaurant from Major Food Group. The décor, Wells writes, leans into a "more is more" aesthetic, but the chef Rich Torrisi is doing "the most subtle and evocative cooking of his career."

Taking On Full-Time Boxer for First Time Is 'Humbling Experience' for Paul: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Paul, the influencer turned prizefighter, had never faced a full-time boxer until Sunday's bout with Tommy Fury. It did not go well for him.
Moments into his cruiserweight bout on Sunday, which headlined a heavily-hyped pay-per-view card in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, Jake Paul connected on Tommy Fury with the kind of right hand that usually makes highlight reels.
In October, a similar shot had dropped the retired mixed martial arts star Anderson Silva in his showdown with Paul, who gained fame through YouTube videos before turning to pro boxing. And in December 2021, Paul had landed an overhand right against Tyron Woodley, another aging M.M.A. standout, knocking him unconscious.
But Fury, a 23-year-old pro boxer from England, barely flinched. Instead, he closed out the first round with a series of sharp jabs, followed by a straight right and a left hook just before the bell.
The bout was sold on the premise that it would settle the question of whether Paul, 26, a social media influencer with high-profile wins against a retired basketball player and M.M.A. fighters, could defeat a legitimate boxer. Those opening sequences provided an early clue.
Paul entered Sunday's contest with a lopsided social media advantage -- 22.7 million Instagram followers to Fury's 4.7 million. But Fury, the half brother of Tyson Fury, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, had better boxing skills. He deployed a longer, sharper jab, landed the more authoritative power punches and used superior timing to achieve a split-decision win. Two judges scored the bout, 76-73, for Tommy Fury, while a third favored Paul by 75-74.
"Tonight, I made my own legacy," Fury said in the ring immediately after the fight. "I had the world on me. I had pressure on my shoulders, and I came through."
Fury improved his record to 9-0, while Paul absorbed his first professional loss.
"This is definitely a humbling experience," said Paul, now 6-1 with four knockouts. "I'll take it on the chin."
That an eight-round fight between fighters who entered with a combined 14 professional fights headlined a pay-per-view event that retailed for $ 49.99 highlighted the power of Paul's self-promotion and the development of his boxing franchise.
Paul's rise as a boxer had been built mostly on buzz, with his succession of wins over widely known part-timers creating the perception, stoked by Paul himself, that he could compete with world-class practitioners. He has called out the retired welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather, who pummeled Paul's brother, Logan, in a 2021 exhibition. Jake Paul has also suggested that he can defeat the super-middleweight champion Saúl Álvarez by 2024.
Three years after his first pro bout, though, Paul had headlined four pay-per-view events but he still had not faced a full-time boxer.
Enter Fury, the youngest, most chiseled and most social-media-savvy member of a boxing family. But whereas Tyson Fury, 34, has been a heavyweight champion since 2015, Tommy is best known for his role on the reality television show "Love Island."
His two previous scheduled meetings with Paul had fallen through, most recently because Fury was denied a visa to travel to the United States because of his family association with Daniel Kinahan, the reputed head of an Irish drug cartel who is wanted by U.S. authorities.
But Fury was free to travel to Saudi Arabia, where the country's sport ministry, backed by its sovereign wealth fund, has bankrolled a long list of pro sports events and has lured significant boxing matches with extravagant purse guarantees. Saudi backers put up $ 77 million to bring an August rematch between Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk to the Jeddah Superdome.
Sunday's fight took place in a temporary outdoor arena, with boxing figures like Mike Tyson, Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder ringside. The soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined a Saudi soccer team after last year's World Cup, also attended. The W.B.C. created a ceremonial title for the occasion: the Diriyah Champion Belt.
Paul and Fury entered the ring with a level of hype and pageantry befitting a Super Bowl, but the skill level on display was akin to an XFL game: professional but not elite.
"This was high-level boxing -- for this level," Shawn Porter, the former world welterweight champion who worked the fight as a broadcast analyst, said after the final bell.
Paul landed occasional counter left hooks and lead right hands but never adjusted to Fury's long, steady left jab. Fury landed straight rights and uppercuts but couldn't prevent Paul from wrapping him up in clinches. Whereas top-tier boxers might have adjusted to those tactics, Fury and Paul kept repeating them, clinching so much that the referee deducted a point from each fighter for excessive holding.
Paul scored the bout's only knockdown -- a jab in the eighth round made an off-balance Fury touch the canvas with his gloves -- but Fury racked up a lopsided statistical advantage: He landed 88 of his 302 punches, compared with 49 of 157 by Paul.
"This, to me, was a world title fight," Fury said.
Paul's first professional loss came in the first bout that strayed from the formula that had brought him boxing fame. After defeating several nonboxers in their late 30s and mid-40s, Paul finally faced a younger opponent whose main sport was boxing.
Those circumstances could complicate Paul's countermoves. His appeal, after all, has rested on the curiosity about what would happen when he faced a real boxer. Sunday provided some answers.
Paul's most recent highly viewed social media clip involved him on HBO's "Game Theory," snapping at the show's host, Bomani Jones, who had asked Paul how he would react if he lost to Fury.
But Paul already knew. His contract with Fury contained a rematch clause, and after the bout Paul said he intended to exercise it.
"We did big business." Paul said at the postfight news conference. "For that reason, the rematch is going to be even bigger."

For Ukraine’s Animals, a Home Is Getting Harder to Find

LVIV, Ukraine — The first thing you hear after entering the animal sanctuary in Znesinnya Park near the center of Lviv are the dogs. There are scores of them barking and howling, members of a raucous makeshift orchestra sounding out a discordant opera.
They are orphans of war, rescued from bombed-out cities or left by refugees who were uprooted from their homes and unable to care for their pets anymore.
Their residence now is a hulking shed, previously abandoned, that has been hastily outfitted with rows of wooden and metal cages, castoff blankets and towers of bagged pet food.
Orest Zalypskyi started Domivka: Home of Rescued Animals five years ago primarily to care for endangered and injured wild creatures: foxes that were used to train hunting dogs and had their claws and teeth removed, a circus monkey about to be euthanized, an owl with a clipped wing.
But since the Russians invaded last year, Domivka has also become a center for rescued pets — dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, lambs and birds. Before the war, the sanctuary contained roughly 200 animals. Now, it has more than 500.
“We didn’t have any place for them,” said Viktoria Stasiv, a volunteer. “It was crazy.” They rushed to put together the dog kennel in an old brick and concrete shed that had been used for trash.
At a different site, about an hour away, are 170 sheep, goats and llamas that Domivka volunteers are caring for on a plot of donated land. The animals belonged to a petting zoo in Zaporizhzhia that had to be abandoned.
Over the past year, the group has hosted thousands of animals, Zalypskyi said.
There was a brief period last spring, after the war began, when animal owners and rescuers were allowed to take animals across the border into other European countries without the usual requirements for things like vaccinations. Busloads of volunteers from Germany and Poland came and took dogs, rabbits and cats back with them. Nearly 5,500 pets were rescued and found new homes outside Ukraine; another 1,500 were adopted inside the country.
But now, adoptions have slowed. Anyone outside Ukraine who wants to liberate a pet from the misery of war has to pay about 200 euros and pick it up. When it comes to dogs, most people want puppies, Stasiv said, but most of the abandoned dogs are older and bigger. Some are injured.
Chip, a sweet-faced mutt, arrived from Kherson, a heavily besieged city 560 miles away, where he was blinded during an attack. Bonie, a large black dog with tan paws and snout, has a steel rod in his back after his spine was broken in a shelling. Lina Brithna, a rehabilitation worker, is helping him learn to walk again. Zubik, a black and white part-malamute, lost one of his front legs.
There are a couple of puppies that were found in a trash can in Lviv. They are kept in a small indoor shelter along with other injured animals and recent arrivals that are quarantined for their first two weeks. They scamper around Brithna as she cleans their cages. The cats watch, occasionally poking their paws through holes in the plexiglass doors, and wait their turn.
All the dogs are taken for walks three times a day along the snowy grounds — by volunteers, visiting families and sometimes former owners, who would love to keep their pets but are themselves refugees and can’t provide a home.
Domivka did not previously have a website, but with so many more animals under its care, the nonprofit is now fundraising on Facebook and Instagram. Over Christmas it sold branded calendars that featured longtime residents and war evacuees, including a white-tipped eagle named Galya.
This small shelter in a Lviv park is one of several domestic and international organizations, like U-Hearts Foundation, UAnimals and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, working to help feed and care for animals during the war.
The shelter needs more staff, enclosures and food, Zalypskyi said through a translator. “The needs are growing every day as the number of animals increase.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

An Architect in Pursuit of Experiences: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: The Dane is into cargo bikes, making pancakes and spiffing up the mysterious top floor of an Art Deco hotel.
After Bjarke Ingels left Copenhagen for New York City in 2010, his first project in Manhattan was a real humdinger: The stark and pyramidal Via 57 West, an apartment building with a not-small hole sliced down the middle, allowing for a courtyard.
Now Mr. Ingels is putting his stamp on other parts of the city, among them the Robert De Niro-backed Wildflower Studios, in Astoria, Queens. "Having spent a good chunk of his life in these environments, Bob has very specific feedback on the dressing and green rooms," Mr. Ingels said of taking direction from the Academy Award winner and famous New Yorker.
His firm is also involved in the East Side Coastal Resiliency project, an initiative to protect part of Manhattan, including East River Park on the Lower East Side, from rising waters because of climate change. The preliminary phase has involved razing what is there now, including beloved trees and fields, which has produced some tensions in the community. "The more people you touch, the more opinions you solicit," Mr. Ingels said of the divisive and long-term undertaking. "But I think most of the residents who experienced Hurricane Sandy would probably prefer to remain dry."
Come the weekend, Mr. Ingels, 48, pivots to a passion project -- renovating the top of a storied Art Deco hotel in Brooklyn Heights -- not far from Dumbo, where he and his son, Darwin, 4, live.
INTERNATIONAL PANCAKES Like a clock, at 3 a.m., Darwin will wake up, complain and come to my bed. Meaning, I wake up with an extremely energetic dude jumping on my face. At around 7 a.m., we make pancakes. Darwin sits on the counter and helps. American pancakes are very fat; very thick. Almost like a bread. Ours are more like a crepe. We have this popular Danish cartoon called Rasmus Klump about a bear who's a sailor, whose mom makes historically tall stacks of these thin pancakes. And it's one of the few things I can really get my guy to eat massively -- you sometimes have to kind of force-feed 4-year-olds. But Danish children are always dreaming of going to town on a pancake stack as tall as Rasmus Klump's.
DARWIN IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT In Denmark, everybody bikes. I don't think cargo bikes are particularly common in the United States, but they make a ton of sense. In general, that front basket thing is incredible. Here in the States, the cargo part is in the back. So I just had a Butchers&Bicycles one shipped here from Copenhagen. That's going to be the way Darwin and I commute through pothole Dumbo to his central Brooklyn school from now on. And because Darwin's sitting in the front, he feels like he is driving. Otherwise, you put your kid in a chair behind you ... but then they're being schlepped, right?
WATERFRONT Here's what I love about my neighborhood: In Dumbo, the city really reaches the water. By contrast, much of Manhattan, with a few exceptions, is encircled by a highway, right?
CHILD-FRIENDLY ART The other Sunday I biked Darwin along the East River, down to my friend Dustin Yellin's studio in Red Hook, next door to Pioneer Works. He makes these art pieces he calls "Psychogeographies." Essentially, collagelike sculpture -- Dustin is a prolific hoarder. And he doesn't mind when you touch his stuff. So, for a kid it's insane because there's so many different things just trapped in frames: a spaceman walking up a staircase; X-acto knives frozen in glass, organized to look like a school of fish.
A RUN, LOOKING UP Typically, the nanny will come Sunday afternoons. One afternoon I was doing my run through Brooklyn Bridge Park (which begins near our apartment) toward Brooklyn Heights, where basically every building is landmarked. And I noticed a giant tower, the St. George Tower, which was part of a 2,632-room Art Deco hotel 100 years ago. The beautiful, arched-windowed top floor appeared abandoned. And I just kept running. Ran on into the tower's foyer, where the doorman said, "Nope, no one has ever lived on the top floor."
THE LONG GAME That was nearly five years ago and I only recently secured my final permit from Landmarks to make it my home. Turns out the original architect, Emery Roth, didn't want to just throw technical installations and petroleum-powered machines on the roof, so he built this top-floor technical space that, from the outside, looks like a ballroom. Inside, it's basically a collage of crappy exposed brick. I'm painting Art Deco leaf silver -- a thin, inexpensive sheet aluminum that inherits whatever texture it's brushed onto -- onto the entire ceiling to retain its weird, messy concrete and steel texture.
DINNER FOR TWO, SKY LOUNGE So, rather than go to a restaurant, I go to the top of the St. George on Sundays. Mostly with my girlfriend, Ingvill, who flies here from Copenhagen a lot. Carried up this little hot plate up so we can cook blinis and have caviar and wine with the sunset.
There are always a few things I need to look at. I've got pinups of the renovation on walls; been taping drawings to the floor so you can really feel it. As an architect, you make lots of assumptions, you imagine and draw; build 3-D models, do everything you can to put yourself in the place of the future resident. But nothing tops actually spending real time there yourself.
FOLLOW THE LIGHT Ingvill and I will have Icelandic acoustic instrumentalist Ólafur Arnalds going on this portable speaker that looks like a picnic basket. We select one of the space's abandoned sofas for an hour or two; then move to another as the light changes. Looking out at the Williamsburg Bridge, then the Verrazzano-Narrows, as the sky becomes darker. It's so visually rich, hours can go by without notice.

Full text: Nicole Eisenman
Through May 13. Print Center New York, 535 West 24th Street, Manhattan; printcenternewyork.org.
It's rare to see a show as well balanced as "Nicole Eisenman: Prince," a retrospective of more than a decade of the artist's collaborations with the New York publishers Harlan & Weaver, Jungle Press Editions and 10 Grand Press. Like her drawings and paintings, Eisenman's prints teem with ideas and art-historical allusions. Sometimes her sense of humor gets the upper hand, as in the lithograph "Man Holding His Shadow," which shows a retired boxer in a windowpane-pattern suit and matching cap mournfully cradling what looks like a deflated inner tube. Sometimes it's her tenderness, as in "Portrait of Evan," a sensitive, impromptu portrait of an assistant at Jungle Press.
Most of the time, though, a Nicole Eisenman print is a riot of competing impulses, so it's especially welcome to see so many of them so judiciously edited and lucidly arranged. The show also amounts to a primer on the extensive possibilities of the medium: There are little copper plate etchings made with matchsticks and string; a jigsaw woodcut monoprint, displayed alongside the printing blocks; cardboard collagraphs; a figure drawn on plywood in wax, cast in aqua resin, and printed from the cast; and seven in-progress proofs of "Watermark," an etching and aquatint, displayed along with the final version. This last is a primer in itself, because what begins as a mysterious, mostly shadowy scene slowly becomes a highly detailed view of the artist's children and their grandparents, complete with patterned wallpaper, trees out the windows, and tiny book titles on the shelves. WILL HEINRICH
Dave Schubert
Through March 5. Public Access, 105 Henry Street, Manhattan; no phone number, no website. On Instagram @publicaccess.nyc
One of Dave Schubert's more well-known photographs, from 2003, is a seven-person street melee outside a dive bar, comical in its complexity -- a suite of limbs and bicycle parts so balletically torqued it's impossible to untangle the conflict -- the kind of beautiful-absurd composition that gets mistaken for a Renaissance painting.
Much of Schubert's work was like this, locating beauty where it would otherwise go unnoticed. Beginning in the 1990s he documented the skaters in and around Washington, D.C., where he grew up, and later, while living in San Francisco, the grimy hedonism of that city's Mission District and Tenderloin neighborhoods. He shot graffiti writers and artists, people living on the street and the Beat poets left behind by their waning acid-soaked bohemia, capturing them with the glittering naturalism of a Weegee shot or the grainy humanism of a Robert Frank. His pictures evince a mutual respect between subject and archivist because he was one of them. (For the most part. Others took exception to the presence of his camera, which he memorialized too, in a recurring series of bloodied self-portraits.)
Schubert, who died last month, at 49, was prolific, and this show is a quickly assembled glimpse of his vision: collages of freight train burners, black-and-white near-abstractions, peeled-off snapshots of friends and associates hanging out, tagging box trucks, or ingesting drugs. Not everything is artful, but neither is everything in life, and Schubert didn't elide reality to create something prettier. As in his portrait of a small boy, his right eye swollen shut, cradling a kitten, Schubert's ability was to present the gruesome and the tender, often within the same frame. MAX LAKIN
Bernadette Corporation
Through March 11. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, Manhattan, 212-463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com.
In the 1990s, an age of anti-globalization protests, Bernadette Corporation emerged as a collective with a series of projects that critiqued capitalism while adopting its strategies: mounting fashion shows, using branding and employing celebrities. The current show at Greene Naftali is austere by comparison, but it succinctly addresses two contemporary ideas: value and erasure.
Throughout the gallery are minimalist pedestals covered with white erasable surfaces. Pennies are stacked on the pedestals, which also include doodles, text, and rough equations taken from the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, drawn with dry-erase marker. Mounted on the walls are mural-size paintings -- if you can even call them paintings -- like "Diagram (World's End Erasable)" (2023), which are made on erasable board and refer to visionary artists and satirists like William Blake and William Hogarth.
Stark and nostalgic, the show reminds us that most things eventually lose value and suffer erasure, from pennies to paintings, which have been marketed in recent decades as durable financial instruments. In a corner of the show, however, is a burst of the old, cheeky Bernadette: an iridescent "Untitled" (2023) basketball made in collaboration with the fashion brand Supreme. Here's the ironic nihilism of the '90s: If artists can't bring down capitalism, at least they can slam it from the inside with a shiny object that splits the difference between design fetish and mass-produced readymade. With value and erasure shifting at accelerating speeds, though, that Bernadette basketball is likely worth more than those crypto shares you bought last year. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Ayanna Dozier
Through March 11. Microscope Gallery, 525 West 29th Street, second floor, Manhattan; 347-925-1433, microscopegallery.com.
The title of Ayanna Dozier's debut New York solo show, "This Country Makes It Hard to Fuck," reads like a rallying cry or lament (and comes from a song by the musician Fever Ray). The exhibition feels more like a meditation -- on pleasure, bodies and how our culture mediates our relationships to both.
The heart of the show is a trilogy of 16-millimeter videos collectively titled "Close, but No Cigar." Each stars Dozier -- who, in addition to being an artist, is an incisive writer -- as a different Black female character, each one sexualized and seeming to crash, emotionally, into the limits or expectations imposed on her by society. In "lovertits" (2022), she sits in a heart-shaped bathtub wearing a frilly bikini, unable to relax. "A Picture for Parco" (2022) is a re-creation of a commercial starring Faye Dunaway; it features Dozier eating a hard-boiled egg while her hypnotic face runs through a gamut of emotions, from seductive to sweet to annoyed to desperate and back in under three minutes.
In the trilogy, desire is fraught; across the gallery, in the silent video "Let's Make Love and Listen to Death From Above" (2022), it's liberated, as two men make out with abandon on city streets. In between hang platinum prints of still-life compositions -- featuring a teacup, condoms and gynecological tools, among other things -- that refer with quotidian intimacy to Dozier's experiences.

Adding Sex Appeal to the Bourbon Shelf
Tomeka Lynch Purcell and her husband, Herbert Purcell, entrepreneurs in Charlotte, North Carolina, decided that the cocktail scene lacked a bourbon appealing to women and to a Black audience. So they set out to fill the gap. Their new straight bourbon is called PurCellos1789, the number referring to the founding date of Tomeka Purcell’s hometown, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. But it travels through several states in the production process: distilled in Indiana, aged 30 months in new charred oak barrels and bottled in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “I created this brand for women like me,” Purcell said. “I wanted a grown-up, sexy and smooth taste.” The spirit is satiny, with a pretty, somewhat floral aroma, flavors of black tea and spice, and a mellow finish. It’s elegant to sip on the rocks or mixed in sours, juleps and more.

Add Some Elegance to the Weeknight Table
There are holiday occasions when paper napkins just won’t cut it. For cloth napkins, a hemstitched edge provides a classy finish. The hemstitch collection from Solino Home, a company that specializes in table linens, features 20-inch squares in several textures that have 1 1/2-inch hemstitched borders. The classic is the lightest (four for $39.99), then there’s medium weight (four for $47.99) and the more rustic heavyweight (four for $42.99); all available in an array of colors. Like most things linen, ironing is required, though you could get by with the medium weight folded straight out of the dryer. Cocktail napkins, place mats, runners and tablecloths are also sold, all worth considering as wedding gifts.

A Survey of American Food History From the Smithsonian
“Smithsonian American Table” condenses the history of food in America, from prehistory to the very present, in about 300 colorful pages and a few dozen recipes — not an easy feat, but a challenge that has been met reasonably well by Lisa Kingsley, a food writer, and the Smithsonian Institution. The book’s five sections explore history, fads, innovators and tastemakers, with subjects that often overlap. Indigenous tribal areas and food cultures, local state specialties like Vermont creemee and South Carolina’s shrimp and grits, and thumbnails of Black and immigrant foods and cooks are covered, as are highlights like beer, cheese and food trucks. Biographies of innovators and tastemakers embrace Irving Naxon, who invented the Crock-Pot, but fast food, breakfast cereals and Clarence Birdseye are mentioned only in passing; Marcella Hazan, the influential Italian cooking expert; trendsetting Caesar Cardini of salad fame; and Instagram, not at all.

Chocolate Bars With a Persian Point of View
The new chocolate bars from Louisa Shafia’s Nashville, Tennessee, company, Feast by Louisa, are slabs of chocolate embedded with dried fruit, spices, nuts and even rice, like French mendiants, but contributing uncommon flavors and nice chew. The seasonings are inspired by Shafia’s Iranian background. The dark chocolate bars are topped and seasoned with crispy rice and saffron salt; pomegranate and walnut; and cardamom, fruit and nut. White chocolate is strewn with saffron and pistachios.

The Comfort of Moroccan Harira, Just Heat and Serve
What took so long? After more than 10 years producing North African, mostly Moroccan pantry staples, the Mina brand has now added harira, a bean soup that’s as common in Morocco as borscht in Eastern Europe. It’s often the dish of choice to break fasts at Ramadan and even at Yom Kippur for Jews; restaurants serve it to the needy. The shelf-stable, well-seasoned chickpea-and-lentil harira is ready to heat and serves one or two. It joins Mina’s heartier stews to ladle over rice, grains or couscous: cumin-scented Loubia white bean, gingery Hummus chick pea, and rich Addis lentil. The stews can be puréed in a blender and thinned a bit for bowls of soup.

Popcorn Ice Cream and More at Brix Haus in Brooklyn, New York
As a pastry chef at Maialino, Locanda Verde and American Cut, it’s appropriate that Tara Glick named her dog, a Frenchton, Brix, a unit of measurement for sugar. The name is now applied to Brix Haus, her new ice cream shop in Brooklyn. Glick said her approach is based on a combination of the denser texture of Italian gelato and the richer, higher butterfat content of American ice cream, each called on depending on the flavor. Blackberry sherbet suggests gelato at its best, while golden popcorn ice cream, a signature, could be scooped at a state fair. The flavors rotate regularly. Scoops in the white-tiled shop start at $3, pints are $12. Pickup and delivery is available for pints or sundaes serving three to six people, $50 to $120.

Supreme Court Case to Focus On Law That Shields Big Tech: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The justices are set to hear a case challenging Section 230, a law that protects Google, Facebook and others from lawsuits over what their users post online.
Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old California college student, was studying abroad in Paris in November 2015 when she was among the 130 people killed in a coordinated series of terrorist attacks throughout the city.
The next year, her father sued Google and other tech companies. He accused the firms of spreading content that radicalized users into becoming terrorists, and said they were therefore legally responsible for the harm inflicted on Ms. Gonzalez's family. Her mother, stepfather and brothers eventually joined the lawsuit, too.
Their claims will be heard in the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday. And their lawsuit, with Google now the exclusive defendant, could have potentially seismic ramifications for the social media platforms that have become conduits of communication, commerce and culture for billions of people.
Their suit takes aim at a federal law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Google's YouTube from lawsuits over content posted by their users or their decisions to take content down. The case gives the Supreme Court's justices the opportunity to narrow how that legal shield is applied or to gut it entirely, potentially opening up the companies to liability for what users post and to lawsuits over libel, discriminatory advertising and extremist propaganda.
A day after hearing the Gonzalez v. Google case, the court is scheduled to hear a second tech lawsuit, Twitter v. Taamneh, over whether Twitter has contributed to terrorism.
What the Supreme Court ultimately decides on the cases will add to a pitched battle around the world over how to regulate online speech. Many governments say that social networks have become fertile ground for hate speech and misinformation. Some have required the platforms to take down those posts. But in the United States, the First Amendment makes it difficult for Congress to do the same.
Critics of Section 230 say that it lets the tech companies avoid responsibility for harms facilitated on their watch. But supporters counter that without the legal shield, the companies will take down more content than ever to avoid lawsuits, stifling free expression.
The Supreme Court case "can have an impact on how those companies do business and how we interact with the internet, too," said Hany Farid, a professor at the school of information at the University of California, Berkeley. He filed a brief with the Supreme Court supporting the Gonzalez family members who are suing Google.
Ms. Gonzalez, a first-generation college student who was studying design at California State University, Long Beach, was killed while out with friends during the Paris attacks in 2015. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility. She was the only American killed.
Her father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued Google, Facebook and Twitter in 2016, arguing the platforms were spreading extremist content. That included propaganda, messages from the Islamic State's leaders and videos of graphic violence, he said. Citing media reports, the lawsuit mentioned specific videos that showed footage of Islamic State fighters in the field and updates from a media outlet affiliated with the group. The online platforms didn't do enough to keep the terrorist group off their sites, the lawsuit said.
YouTube and other platforms say they screen for such videos and take down many of them. But in 2018, research that was based on a tool developed by Mr. Farid found that some Islamic State videos stayed up for hours, including one that encouraged violent attacks in Western nations.
Facebook and Twitter were removed as defendants in the lawsuit in 2017, the same year Ms. Gonzalez's mother, stepfather and siblings joined plaintiffs. Last year, a federal appeals court ruled that Google did not have to face the Gonzalez family members' claims because the company was protected by Section 230.
In May, lawyers for Ms. Gonzalez's family asked the Supreme Court to step in. By using algorithms to recommend content to users, the lawyers argued, YouTube was essentially engaging in its own form of speech, which was not protected by Section 230.
Ms. Gonzalez's father and the plaintiffs in the Twitter case declined to comment through their lawyer, Keith Altman. Mr. Altman said that courts had "pushed the limits" of the Section 230 legal shield to the point that it was "unrecognizable." A lawyer for Ms. Gonzalez's other family members did not respond to a request for comment. The lawyer who will argue both cases before the Supreme Court, Eric Schnapper, also declined to comment.
Google has denied the Gonzalez family's arguments about Section 230. It has said that the family's claims that Google supported terrorism are based on "threadbare assertions" and "speculative" arguments.
In Congress, efforts to reform Section 230 have stalled. Republicans, spurred by accusations that internet companies are more likely to take down conservative posts, proposed tweaking the law. Democrats said the platforms should take more content down when it spreads misinformation or hate speech.
Instead, courts started exploring the limits to how the law should be applied.
In one case in 2021, a federal appeals court in California ruled that Snap, the parent of Snapchat, could not use Section 230 to dodge a lawsuit involving three people who died in a car crash after using a Snapchat filter that displayed a user's speed.
Last year, a federal judge in California said that Apple, Google and Meta, Facebook's parent, could not use the legal shield to avoid some claims from consumers who said they were harmed by casino apps. A federal judge in Oregon also ruled that the statute didn't shield Omegle, the chat site that connects users at random, from a lawsuit that said an 11-year-old girl met a predator through its service.
Tech companies say it will be devastating if the Supreme Court undercuts Section 230. Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google's general counsel, said in an interview in December that the protections had been "crucial to allowing not just Google but the internet to flourish in its infancy, to actually become a major part of the broader U.S. economy."
"It's critically important that it stands as it is," she said.
A spokesman for Meta pointed to a blog post where the company's top lawyer said the case "could make it much harder for millions of online companies like Meta to provide the type of services that people enjoy using every day."
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.
Activists have raised concerns that changes to the law could cause the platforms to crack down on content posted by vulnerable people. In 2018, a new law ended the protections of Section 230 when platforms knowingly facilitated sex trafficking. The activists say that caused sites to take down content from adult sex workers and posts about L.G.B.T.Q. people.
The Gonzalez case has also attracted interest from the Justice Department. In a December brief, the agency told the Supreme Court it believed that Section 230 "does not bar claims based on YouTube's alleged targeted recommendations of ISIS content." The White House has said the legal shield should be removed.
Mr. Farid acknowledged it was possible the court could gut the Section 230 protections, leading to unintended consequences. But he noted that the social networks already comply with laws governing how they treat certain types of content, like German restrictions on digital hate speech. He said they could navigate narrow changes to the legal shield, too.
"The companies figured it out," he said.

How Far to Go for Beyoncé?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Members of the BeyHive are going to extraordinary lengths -- some of them trans-Atlantic -- to ensure they don't miss the superstar on her coming world tour.
To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android .
How far would you go to see the winningest artist in Grammy history? Is it more or less than 5,800 miles?
For Janny Nascimento, a 29-year-old English teacher in Brazil, missing Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour -- the singer's first solo tour since 2016 -- was not an option. So she plunked down 850 euros, or about $ 900, for a pair of tickets to see her favorite artist on June 24 in Frankfurt, Germany.
"I would do it again if I had to because this is the dream come true," Ms. Nascimento said from her apartment in Campos dos Goytacazes, a town four hours northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Though she has never before traveled outside Brazil, "now I'm going through two continents to a place that I have never been to, a country where I don't even speak the language," she said.
The announcement of the tour on Instagram last week immediately touched off a frenzy for tickets, with fans losing their minds with presale (and resale) anxieties. Chances to snag tickets before they went on sale to the general public were offered to members of Beyoncé's official fan club and holders of certain credit cards through exclusive presale drops.
But early in the registration process, Ticketmaster issued an ominous warning that "demand already exceeds the number of tickets available by more than 800 percent" in several cities, prompting some worried fans to consider an unlikely option: If I'm determined not to miss this tour, is it possible that the rational thing to do is cross an ocean for a concert?
Bre Harper, 27, a creative partnerships manager at Spotify who lives in Los Angeles, realized her chances of getting tickets to a North American stop on the tour were slim to none.
"I, with the rest of the internet, went on Ticketmaster, where you have to be verified as a fan," Ms. Harper said, referring to restrictions on sales for U.S. tour dates.
"I did not make a Verified Fan account with Ticketmaster," she added. "I just have a regular account. I didn't feel like fiddling with the whole Verified Fan thing."
While scrolling on TikTok, Ms. Harper learned that she did not have to be verified to buy tickets to the European leg of the tour. She also noticed that tickets for European dates were often hundreds of dollars cheaper than comparable tickets in the United States, she said. When she asked her boyfriend if he would be willing to travel with her, he said yes.
The only European city she could find with tickets available in the "Club Renaissance" standing section was Warsaw, Poland. Ms. Harper, who said she believed the 40-city tour could be the artist's last, bought a pair of $ 475 tickets as quickly as she could.
"She now has a life, a family," Ms. Harper said. "I think this is going to be her last hurrah and I didn't want to miss it."
Tickets to the tour, which is in support of Beyoncé's seventh solo studio album, "Renaissance," went on sale to members of the BeyHive fan club on Monday. Ticketmaster's decision to require Verified Fan registration reflects one of the company's most muscular attempts yet to thwart bots and stop scalpers from buying tickets and reselling them at absurd markups.
Late last year, Ticketmaster was forced to cancel a planned general release of tickets to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour after an overheated presale period ended in chaos. Ms. Swift's fans complained that tickets were being sold at preposterous markups of up to tens of thousands of dollars on sites like StubHub.
The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Live Nation Entertainment, which owns Ticketmaster. Last month, during a nearly three-hour Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, politicians painted the concert giant as a monopoly that hinders competition and harms consumers. Shortly after the announcement of the Renaissance World Tour, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued an ominous warning to Ticketmaster on Twitter.
Ticketmaster, whose parent company's president has acknowledged problems with the presale for Ms. Swift's tour, did not immediately respond to questions on Friday.
The tour is scheduled to begin on May 10 in Stockholm, cutting a path across Europe through June before heading to North America in July.
Ms. Harper, a self-described military brat, said she had traveled through Europe extensively, but she had never been to Poland.
"It's not that frightening to me," Ms. Harper said. "You only live once -- let's go!"
Ms. Harper, who posted on Twitter about acquiring her tickets, said that, as a Black woman, she was nervous about only one thing.
"I had a lot of people comment or quote my tweet and tell me that there are some racial issues in Poland currently," she said. "That's probably the only thing that I'm just a tad bit nervous about."
"But the BeyHive is so supportive," she added, referring to the superstar's legion of fans. "There are so many folks that are in my DMs saying that they live or they have relatives in Poland. They are already offering to help me with places to go, eat, and how to navigate the metro."
After she missed an opportunity to see Beyoncé in Rio de Janeiro in 2013, Ms. Nascimento was resolved not to let another chance go by. Although she doesn't have a passport yet, she has already taken a photo for it.
"I'm still struggling, looking at the credit card receipt," Ms. Nascimento said. "I would do it again if I had to," she added wistfully.
"This is inspired by the album," Ms. Nascimento said, her pink box braids pulled away from her face. "When 'Break My Soul' came out, I was in a very dark place in my life," she said, "and it was like Beyoncé wrote this thinking about me."
"She knows that I'm struggling, she knows what's going on," Ms. Nascimento added. "She was like, release your job, release your mind, you know, let down your hair."

Made for Walking, If You're Astro Boy: [Style Desk]

Full text: A New York collective known for smart-alecky drops has once again captured the internet's imagination, this time with oversize red boots that look to be pried straight off Astro Boy's feet.
From the people who brought you cologne that smells like WD-40, "Birkinstock" sandals made from Birkin bags and Times Newer Roman, a font ever so slightly wider than Times New Roman, comes a hotly anticipated new release: the Big Red Boot.
The boots were created by MSCHF, a New York-based collective with a rich history of trolling consumer culture, sometimes doing so by selling consumer goods. Images of the boots, which are expected to go on sale next Thursday, have captivated Twitter and TikTok with their absurdity.
It takes only a glance to understand why. The AirPod-shaped boots are globby from toe to ankle, at which point they jut straight up to midcalf. They are a shade of red that can only be described as "red," recalling Babybel cheese, clown noses and Swedish Fish. And they are smooth -- too smooth -- as if a pair of Moon Boots were pumped full of Botox. They look more like the idea of a shoe than a shoe itself.
"Big Red Boots are REALLY not shaped like feet, but they are EXTREMELY shaped like boots," the brand said in a news release.
They are, in a word, cartoonish -- seemingly by design. (MSCHF calls the shoes "cartoon boots for a cool 3-D world.") Online, they have been compared to the footwear of the anime character Astro Boy and of Boots, the helpful sidekick of "Dora the Explorer."
They began appearing on social media this month, in images from a photo shoot featuring the model Sarah Snyder and on the feet of the Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. On TikTok, they racked up more than 20 million views. Commenters mocked the boots; headlines declared them "stupid," "absurd" and divisive.
MSCHF rejected the idea that the boots were a joke. "It's not a satire," MSCHF said in a statement to The New York Times, after declining to be interviewed. "But what's interesting is that we're at a moment in time where it doesn't have to be." The group said the cartoonish aesthetic had been "mainstreamed enough" to make the Big Red Boot legible as, you know, a boot.
It is true that bulbous footwear has recently made it down runways for Loewe and Balenciaga, and that some other accessories, like handbags, have gotten puffy lately. In an all-caps "manifesto" about the boots, MSCHF pointed to Alexander McQueen's similarly surreal "armadillo" shoes.
MSCHF may be releasing the boots with a straight face, but they are the work of a team that has long understood the relationship between divisiveness and virality. Members of the group have released a litany of pranks in the form of products since 2016, but MSCHF was officially founded in 2019, by Daniel Greenberg, Gabriel Whaley, Stephen Tetreault, Kevin Wiesner and Lukas Bentel (they are not fond of titles).
Some of the brand's past outrage bait has courted sacrilege. (At the time of a 2020 feature in The Times, its office in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn had a decorative pentagram on the floor.) In a 2021 collaboration with Lil Nas X, it released "Satan Shoes": Nike Air Max 97s that contained the blood of MSCHF team members. Nike swiftly sued.
"We're OK being hated," Mr. Greenberg told The Times that year. "We just don't want apathy."
This time around, the footwear seems to be finding an audience eager to be in on the joke.
"I'm getting to the point with fashion where I want to wear things that make no sense," said Sophia Attie, 24, a paralegal in Brooklyn who owns a pair of light-up Crocs released in collaboration with 7-Eleven.
Ms. Attie said that she would not pay the boots' $ 350 retail price, but that she liked the idea. "I want someone to look at my feet and go, 'That's dumb,"' she said.
"They remind me of Clifford the Big Red Dog," said Jacinda Pender, 24, a model and makeup artist in Los Angeles who was also interested in owning the boots. "Like, OK Clifford, I see you with the boots!"
Although the boots are not yet available to the public, the influencers and sneakerheads who have been sent pairs in advance of their official release have provided MSCHF with a bottomless well of social media fodder.
A pair of Big Red Boots in a size 10 arrived on the doorstep of Steve Natto, 25, a sneaker YouTuber in Philadelphia, on Feb. 1. He promptly gave them a test drive for his audiences on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.
"I tried doing casual walking; I even tried jumping in them," he said, adding that he had received several follow-up comments asking if he could drive in them: "I'm not sure you can."
A pair arrived on Monday at Bowery Showroom, a concept store and content house on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. (Mr. Natto and Matt Choon, the showroom's chief executive, were sent free pairs of the boots; both men said they were not paid to film content about them.)
Mr. Choon said customers had been coming in to film videos in the boots nonstop since they arrived. He said the store's single pair would soon be on loan to the rapper Fivio Foreign to wear in a music video.
"They have all of the elements to viral marketing: the influencers, the rollout," Mr. Choon said. "Every single ingredient is there."
Staff members have uploaded several videos of the boots to the showroom's TikTok account. In one video that was filmed by Michael Pico, a stylist, a customer tries on the zipperless boots and gets stuck in them.
The showroom staff did eventually wrest them off -- but only by pulling the customer's leg.

Hanging out: It’s a loose social dynamic in which people spend unstructured time together with no set agenda. (Did you need a reminder? Has it been a minute?)
The shortage of idle hangs in our culture is what inspired Sheila Liming, an Edith Wharton scholar, writing professor, professional bagpipe player and devoted socializer, to write “Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time.” The book conceives of hanging out as a way to reclaim time as something other than a raw ingredient to be converted into productivity. Just as she does in her book, in a recent video interview from Vermont, Liming made a philosophical argument for the chillest of human interactions. This interview has been edited and condensed.
Q: When did you start thinking about hanging out as a radical act?
A: Coming into my 30s and moving around the country forced me to make new friends again. I thought about how difficult it is to seize unstructured social time as an adult. We live in a hyperscheduled Google Calendar world, where we make appointments with each other to get any face time. So there’s a sense that if you hang out with someone, you’re stealing time away from their calendar. It adds pressure to perform, to make it good. But I think that that’s a really damaging way to go about seeing our interactions. That’s why so much of the book argues in favor of unstructured time with people: There’s a great freedom that comes from low expectations.
Q: For the unchill among us, what do you suggest as a gateway into the art of the long, loose hang?
A: I love participating in a low-stakes project. My partner recently joined a bocce league. I love bocce. There is maybe no lower-stakes game that exists in the world. You’re just hanging out in the park with people.
I work this Christmas tree sale every December that benefits this committee on temporary shelter here in Burlington. People buy Christmas trees, and we help them tie the trees to their car, but really, it’s 10 of us just drinking hot chocolate. Having something for us to do, to focus on together, makes the interaction a little bit smoother. We talk about politics and culture. I learn things from these people, and then I don’t see them again for another six months or a year.
Q: You had this very particular experience, where a close friend of yours in North Dakota had a reality show made about her life. You had to “hang out” and perform your friendship on camera for the show. Was this the interaction that primarily changed your relationship to hanging out and its documentation?
A: In many ways, that was the kernel: this feeling that the more that I got into playing her friend on television, the less I was actually being her friend anymore. Our relationship was fraying, but we had to maintain it for the sake of the plot. It was strange, because it was like we were being friends and hanging out for a hypothetical audience of people who existed somewhere else, but not for each other.
Q: The book touches a bit on hanging at work. What are your thoughts on mandatory fun?
A: I went to mandatory fun yesterday! The provost made a specific gesture to invite me. She was like, “Oh, you wrote a book about hanging out — you’re going to love this.” I was like, “Oh, no, no.” I’m the poster child for hanging out, even under duress.
The concept of mandatory fun in the workplace is sometimes used simply as a means of assuaging management guilt about the way that work normally functions. It’s artificial, and it’s a situation where you’re not there to primarily have fun, you’re there to do a duty.
Q: But you’re into hanging out, in a day-to-day way, on the job?
A: I think those kinds of casual interactions are part of what makes work meaningful. It’s part of what makes it bearable when it’s bad. It’s also what allows you to feel that your job is not just your job. You’re not responsible for solving every single problem by yourself.
Q: How do you host a hang that doesn’t feel like social obligation with a cheese board?
A: Don’t overthink the aesthetics. I think the second that people see a party that’s really beautiful and charming, they assume they’re there to be photographed and not experienced. This adds a new level of pressure because now it becomes about Instagram and not about the people who are in the room with you. A little bit of mess can go a long way to make people comfortable.
Q: So, Sheila, tell it to me straight: You lead a very full life outside of work: You garden, you play bagpipes, you volunteer, you read, you hang out. Is that what happens when you never join social media?
A: I have sometimes wondered that myself! If I had been on Facebook for the past 20 years, how many hours would I have spent putting into those activities? I’m very conscious of having had to set boundaries about my time. I would say that I’m pretty vigilant about making my priorities into priorities.
Q: One of your arguments, essentially, is to be where you are. But when thinking about fostering relationships, it seems more intuitive to me to text a friend or sibling rather than chat with a stranger while waiting in line somewhere. How do you think about prioritizing not the relationship that has depth but the relationship that has only proximity?
A: I keep thinking about this concept with reference to democracy. Democracy hinges on our ability to care about each other, whether or not we actually know each other very well. Like, we have to have this feeling: I want you to have good infrastructure and good schools, even if I don’t benefit from them. This hypothetical care is very important for sustaining the workings of the society that we live in.
I live 2,000 miles away from my family, so I totally get prioritizing that. But if that means that we’re taking ourselves out of a contemporary situation and ignoring the people around us, what we’re also doing is sending the signal that those people don’t matter to us — that the person sitting next to us in a room might as well not exist — which I think is a somewhat dangerous message to broadcast in a democracy.

Survivor of Flooded Cave Is Found Dead in His Room: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Duangphet Promthep, 17, was a member of the soccer team that escaped from a submerged cave in Thailand in 2018 and later attended a soccer academy in England. The cause of his death was unclear.
Five years ago, Duangphet Promthep survived a harrowing test of human endurance under rock and in darkness -- the 13-year-old captain of a Thai soccer team that had been trapped before being rescued from a flooded cave in an effort that became a global drama.
He moved to England last year after securing a scholarship to a soccer academy that promoted its high-level program and international student population. "I promise I will focus and do my best," he wrote on social media at the time, later posting photographs of his classes and the school grounds.
Dom, as he was known to his friends, eluded one tragedy, but not a second. He died on Tuesday, according to his family and the Zico Foundation, a Thai nonprofit group that helped him win the scholarship. He was 17.
No cause of death was given, but Kiatisuk Senamuang, the Zico Foundation's founder, told reporters on Wednesday that a teacher found the student unconscious in his dorm room on Sunday afternoon. He died in a hospital after becoming unresponsive.
"We are waiting for his body to return," his mother, Thanaporn Duangthep, said at a virtual news conference from the town of Mae Sai, in northern Thailand. Her son, she said, had at least fulfilled his dream of being a soccer student abroad.
The teenager found himself in the international spotlight five years ago as one of 12 boys who ventured into Tham Luang Cave in Chiang Rai Province along with their coach after soccer practice.
Heavy rain filled the cave entrance, pushing the group deeper into a warren of complex underground passages to avoid drowning and leaving them trapped.
The team's path to survival became a closely watched global drama, and their extraordinary escape was hailed as a miraculous feat of human collaboration. Found alive more than a week after they went missing, the group had survived by conserving energy and licking water off the cave walls.
Their eventual rescue, more than a week later, ultimately involved Thai Navy Seals, expert cave divers from around the world and workers from several government agencies, and the use of pumps to keep water levels at bay.
Divers used guide ropes and air tanks placed along the dangerous two-mile route and held the boys, who wore full face masks, under their bodies as they navigated each crevice -- a four-hour ordeal. The team survived, but one volunteer diver, Saman Gunan, died when he lost consciousness after a journey to place air tanks along the route.
In the dark underground, Dom had celebrated his 13th birthday, said Vernon Unsworth, one of the cave rescuers.
When the avid soccer player said in August that he had won a scholarship to attend the Brooke House College Football Academy in Leicestershire in England, about 75 miles northwest of London, he referred to it on Instagram as "an important moment" in his life.
"Today my dream has come true," he said. The soccer academy has billed itself as a training ground that has sent multiple players on to professional careers.
The school said in a statement on Wednesday that it was devastated by his death. "We unite in grief with all of Dom's family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life," they said. The school added that it was in contact with the Thai Embassy in London but declined to release more details.
A spokesman for the Leicestershire Police said that officers had been called to the school on Sunday afternoon, and that a 17-year-old student had died after being taken to a hospital. The death, they said in a statement, was not being treated as suspicious.
Dom's former teammates shared their condolences online on Wednesday, mourning a promising future cut short and pointing to the hardships they had survived together.
Describing their friend as a brother who motivated them to pursue their ambitions in the sport, they said he aspired to play for Thailand's national team.
"When we met last time before you left for England, I still jokingly said to you that I have to get your autograph when you come back," said Prachak Sutham, who was a member of the team, known as the Wild Boars, that was rescued from the cave. "Rest in peace my friend, there will always be 13 of us."
"You are one of the persons who pushes me and makes me want to develop myself to your level," said another teammate, Chanin Viboonrungruang. "If next life is real, I wish we will play football together as a team again."
He had been happy in England, said Mr. Kiatisuk, and wanted to continue playing soccer.
"The sad thing is he was given the opportunity he wanted in life and now his life is suddenly been taken away at a very young age," said Mr. Unsworth, one of the rescuers, adding that there were not enough words to describe the outpouring of grief. "Life is very cruel."

How to Score a Vintage Handbag: [Style Desk]

Full text: What's a good deal? Where should you look?
The ubiquity of certain "it" handbags on social media can create a feeling of snow blindness when you're scrolling online. If you want to break out of that trend cycle, the solution is obvious: Get a vintage bag.
This is a wild and exciting world to dive into! It's also overwhelming. Allow me to talk you through it. You'll want to take your time, familiarize yourself with sellers' authentication guarantees, do research on serial numbers, get a lay of the land on competitive pricing and learn to understand the subtleties of how sellers describe the conditions of their goods. Sounds exhausting but trust me, it's worth it.
You should know things like what Prada calls its nylon (tessuto) and the name of Bottega Veneta's woven leather (intrecciato). Never hesitate to ask questions or request more photos -- advice that also applies to life in general.
For our purposes, we're using a loose definition of vintage: at least a decade old. There are many, many, many strategies for shopping for vintage bags. One way is to frequent vintage shops that carry a lot of bags. Check out What Goes Around Comes Around in New York and Beverly Hills, Calif., or Dina C's Fab & Funky Consignment Boutique in Palm Beach, Fla. (a.k.a., destination shopping heaven). Browse by designer at a resale site like ReBag or Fashionphile. Visit super-specific destinations like ClosetfullofCoco on Instagram, which sells Chanel exclusively -- and almost all of it bags.
If you need something to do after eating lunch and before returning to work, browsing Christie's Collection of André Leon Talley is a solid use of your time. Mr. Talley was not just a fashion historian and writer but a real shopper. While few can attend the live auction on Feb. 15, and fewer can place a winning bid on a beige ponyhair Chanel bag or a black Ralph Lauren alligator duffel, looking at the collection can inspire your own vintage bag rabbit hole.
Satin is one of my favorite materials for bags, especially small evening bags with drawstrings or fringe. Renaud Pellegrino's bright pink satin bag would be ideal for a night at the ballet, maybe. Also, look for materials that were often used in past decades, like tortoiseshell, resin or Bakelite.
Or you might try looking for earlier pieces from your favorite labels. Search for Kate Spade from the early aughts when some of the bags were made in Italy. You can find wonderful Tom Ford-era Gucci or Yves Saint Laurent bags. Ditto Louis Vuitton bags in Epi leather, a Vuitton-specific creation that's textured with tiny wavy ridges.
Another way to search is by looking for bag shapes that were all the rage before your time. I like to search for frame bags or top handle bags; the Céline clasp bag from just a few years ago is a favorite. For a treat, try minaudières, a whole world unto itself. Maybe a Judith Leiber egg?
Important note! You won't look costume-y if you wear any of these with normal clothes. But looking like you're in costume isn't always a bad thing.
Roberta di Camerino
A friend of mine who designs accessories loves to search for Sharif bags from the 1980s and Susan Gail bags for their high quality leather. Another classic is Roberta di Camerino, an Italian brand whose heyday was in the midcentury and whose bags are known for trompe l'oeil and color-blocking. Once you see the bags, you can't unsee their influence in other designers' work -- Prada, Gucci. There are a lot of bags around at an array of prices. I prefer the velvet to the vinyl and would wear it with thin wale corduroy pants. 640 euros; about $ 700
Mark Cross
For a certain kind of fashion fixated person, the biggest revelation in "Rear Window" was the box bag Grace Kelly's character carried. There are vintage versions of the bag on 1stdibs.com, but Mark Cross continues to make a smaller version of the bag that Gerald Murphy, who ran Mark Cross, designed in 1954 for the film, called the Rear Window Day Case. (Mr. Murphy and his wife, Sara, were significant Lost Generation figures, legendary for their time in the South of France.) I find the interior mirror completely charming. Black is practical, but who needs practical? Go with the celadon. $ 3,590
Hermès
The Birkin and the Kelly bags are more or less household names, but Hermès has a deep bench of lesser known styles: Picotin, Chevreuse, Chaîne D'Ancre, Cordelière, Sandrine. "I think many overlook all of the wonderful styles Hermès had in the '60s," said Zabrina Estrada, who owns Etéreo Vintage in Brooklyn. "I love the Palonnier in a skin, and the Piano bag is also really chic." Her dream bag is the Mallette, which has a lockable compartment for jewelry. The Brooklyn Museum has one owned by Babe Paley that was donated by her social secretary! $ 13,000
Manolo Blahnik
I consider companies whose bags are less celebrated than other things they make a whole category of vintage. Bally fits in there, as does any bag from Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Nina Ricci, Fortuny and Ferragamo. Kudos to whoever gets this gold and pink metallic polka-dot Manolo clutch worthy of Cher Horowitz, Carrie Bradshaw or other '90s protagonists. $ 487.50
Chanel
Vintage Chanel bags go in a lot of directions. You could get a wild piece from one of its collections, like an $ 84,000 shopping basket from 2014 made out of the house's signature chains. Take it to the farmers' market? But as with Hermès, the elegant move would be a piece from the 1960s, like a chocolate brown Ottoman bag with a lipstick red lining. Why does red lining make everything better? 1,800 euros; about $ 1,960
Louis Vuitton
Skip all the Louis Vuitton logos, unless you're buying a trunk. Instead, go for simple. Sumptuous. Mysterious but privileged. I'm talking about Sofia Coppola! But specifically, the Louis Vuitton Sofia Coppola SC Bag Leather PM. The navy blue is classic. In fact, everything about this bag is classic. I'd be happy with any color -- light brown, cherry red, oxblood -- and it's large enough to carry a laptop, wallet, tiny notepad for deep thoughts, a bag of Doritos. You know, the essentials. $ 2,005

Isolated in Shaken Villages, and Resigned to Make It on Their Own: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a small cemetery toward the end of a dirt road that winds between snowy mountains in rural southern Turkey, a dozen new graves slant partway up the mountainside. Pine fronds and olive branches have been laid on top. At the head of each grave stands a cinder block tied with a scarf, a small tribute: purple, red, flowered.
The villagers of Kayabasi buried their loved ones themselves, their town cut off, blocked by boulders that had crashed down during the earthquake that had shaken them recently. Until the road was cleared two days later, they were on their own.
"Everyone took their dead out from the rubble however they could, with their hands," said Ozkan Durmaz, 36, who works for a telecommunications company. "We didn't expect everything from the government. There was solidarity between citizens."
In the aftermath of last week's earthquake, which killed more than 35,000 in Turkey, broken cities received wall-to-wall news media coverage and the bulk of emergency crews and aid.
Help did not start rolling into the rural areas such as Islahiye, the district surrounding Kayabasi, for days, held up in part by damaged or blocked roads and by what local volunteers said was a lack of awareness of the area's great need.
Across southern Turkey, earthquake survivors who have been sleeping outside -- unable to go home, or unwilling to risk staying inside amid fears of aftershocks -- remain in need of shelter, blankets and toilets. The gap appears particularly acute in rural areas.
The district of Islahiye, which is famous for its grapes, received little attention until social media posts started being shared by celebrities, said Hacer Bulbul, 36, a native of the town of Islahiye. Her Instagram post about the area eventually helped draw donations there.
Ms. Bulbul, a personal development expert who lives in Istanbul, returned to her hometown on Tuesday and has barely slept since, distributing donated aid from a gas station on a shattered street in Islahiye.
The first three trucks of government supplies arrived on Wednesday. But her mind kept racing, going over the things that the thousands of people sleeping in the freezing cold, mostly under tarps, still needed: tents, heaters, cooking gas, pots and pans so people could make use of donated rice and bulgur wheat.
"Until yesterday, there was still a lot of rubble with bodies under it. People died screaming under the rubble," Ms. Bulbul said, adding that even though donors sent heavy machinery to lift the debris, no one was available to operate it.
"There was a lack of coordination," she said, and the team sent by the government was "very small."
Home to native Turks, people of Kurdish origin and Syrian refugees, Islahiye sits in the flat of a valley, with villages radiating out into the rolling green hills and white-capped mountains. One-story homes of concrete or mud brick dot the landscape in pastel clusters, some with grape arbor vines climbing their roofs, interspersed with the occasional small school or mosque.
A stream runs along the road into the mountains, dammed here and there into small waterfalls. On Saturday, cars and trucks had to navigate around hulking boulders on the side of the road that had torn gashes into the mountainside and ripped olive trees from the earth when they tumbled down during the disaster.
Kayabasi, the second-to-last village on the route, has been around for at least 200 years, residents said. They count the population not by the number of people but by the number of households, which was around 300 before the earthquake.
There are few landmarks: the Gulpinar mosque, whose minaret has collapsed; the cemetery; the elementary school; the two mini-markets; the aluminum mine; an ancient site up on the mountain that the villagers' grandparents told them marks the graves of sacred martyrs.
As the earth shook the darkness early on Feb. 6, some villagers said they heard a voice bellowing down from the martyrs' graves. "Allah!" it called, in what they interpreted as a lifesaving warning. People ran into the knee-high snow barefoot.
About a dozen people from the village died. One family was pulled from the rubble alive.
The aftermath offered reminders of the village's isolation. With no imams left in Kayabasi, a retired one conducted rites for the dead. With no available help from the local municipality, villagers dug the graves themselves. With no government tents on offer, they drove to less remote villages to try to scrounge white tents.
Days later, there was resigned acceptance at being left on their own. The destruction had been widespread, residents said, and the roads had been blocked. They just hoped they would get more tents soon.
Some villagers packed what they could and moved to other towns or cities to be with their children, who had left years earlier to find jobs. Those who remained were living under tarps.
"It's hard to earn bread here," said Ali Uygun, 54, a white-haired man who works as a driver and a shepherd. "We can't read or write. We don't have brains. If we had brains, we wouldn't stay here."
Like other parts of southern Turkey where the government has uprooted entire towns at will after earthquakes or to make way for dams, this area has a history of forced migration, displacement and resettlement that has permanently split communities. Ms. Bulbul's grandfather was among many tribal leaders from around Turkey whom the government forced to migrate to Islahiye, in order to break the power they held in their original homes, she said.
Their faces still blank with shock, survivors in Kayabasi said they had not given much thought to where they would live beyond the next few days. Maybe they would be told that their homes were stable enough to live in, and they would stay. Maybe they would have to move elsewhere, and they would leave.
"It's up to the government," more than one man in the village said.
For the women, who spent most of their days at home taking care of the children, the idea of leaving seemed more disturbing.
Sevinc Bulut, 37, a mother of five, had taken over the cooking for five families sharing the same two tents, using melted snow for tea and soup for the first two days, until water arrived on aid trucks. Until someone managed to find a government-issued tent on Friday, they had been sleeping in shifts under one blue tarp stretched over little olive trees: women and children lying on daybeds hustled out of their partly collapsed houses, men sitting up or standing guard outside.
Donated sacks of potatoes lay piled along one side. A wood-burning stove they had risked going inside to retrieve warmed the center, its chimney poking out from a hole in the tarp.
Melting snow and rain the first few days had made the ground a muddy misery; Ms. Bulut and her husband decided to send her in-laws away to stay in a slightly better tent in their relatives' village, and she was afraid that a "very naughty" child of hers was getting sick.
But despite the frigid conditions, Ms. Bulut could not imagine separating from her relatives and neighbors in Kayabasi.
"If everyone leaves, I don't know what to do here alone. If I go, what's she going to do?" she said, gesturing toward Neslihan Bulut, 45, her sister-in-law. "We can't leave each other."
She released a sigh. The future was unclear. Even tomorrow was unclear.
"Well," she said, lifting her shoulders in a shrug of resignation. "We are here for now."

For the Covid-Conscious, Dining Out Is About Risk: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Readers want to know where they can feel safe, but the answer is different for everyone.
"Do restaurants even care about Covid-conscious diners anymore?" A version of this question has appeared in the Where to Eat inbox on a regular basis since I started writing this newsletter nearly a year ago. And to be honest, I didn't quite feel comfortable making risk assessments for anyone other than myself.
"Risk tolerance is essentially how much risk do you think is too risky for you, and that's notoriously subjective," Dien Ho, a professor of philosophy and health care ethics at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, told me. "What is risky for one person is completely pedestrian for the next."
So, he said, ask these three questions when assessing how reasonable it is for you to dine out: How vulnerable am I? How risky is it for me to dine out? And how am I going to affect other people, including family, friends and acquaintances, if I decide to?
"There's no magic formula," Dr. Ho said.
Many New Yorkers are clearly ready to carry on as before. There's been a voracious enthusiasm for going out to eat, for feeling "normal." But since Mayor Eric Adams's decision to lift the vaccine mandate for indoor dining in March 2022, there's no guarantee that your fellow diners are vaccinated. And as city regulators and residents work to close many outdoor dining structures, some restaurants have given up on maintaining or offering them.
So what should the Covid-conscious and the immunocompromised do?
To start, assess current Covid rates. The Times has a case tracker with the latest trends, as well as tips on how to read Covid data. But because those statistics are based on reported cases, the single best way to monitor the situation, Dr. Ho advised, is to check data on the prevalence of Covid in wastewater. The Centers for Disease Control maintain a National Wastewater Surveillance System website, and the New York State Wastewater Surveillance Network regularly updates its database, which is usually about two weeks behind but easier to navigate than the C.D.C. site. Detection levels in New York City in late January indicated generally high levels of Covid citywide, though that's the case in almost every major city in the state.
While we're no longer at the peak of the pandemic, and treatment options are more robust and effective, the threat of long Covid and new mutations of the virus remain. On top of that, roughly 85 percent of New York City residents had not received a bivalent booster shot as of Feb. 2, according to the New York City health department. "We're nowhere near close to this thing being over," Dr. Ho said.
Knowing that zero risk is nearly impossible to achieve, here are some best practices for those determined to dine out. For one, Dr. Ho recommended sticking to big, airy restaurants. Insa in Gowanus, Brooklyn, or Isabelle's Osteria near Union Square are a much safer bet than cozy, I-can-hear-everyone's-conversation spots.
"You might choose a night that is less popular, less crowded in order to lower your risk," he said. That would typically be a Monday or Tuesday, or before 6 p.m. most nights of the week.
Still too much risk? Head outside. I spent this week reaching out to (good) restaurants to confirm that their outdoor areas were heated, well-ventilated and, in some cases, built for private parties. There's Quality Bistro (French, Midtown Manhattan), Wayla (Thai, Lower East Side), Bottino (Italian, Chelsea), Oso (Mexican, Harlem), Rule of Thirds (Japanese, Greenpoint), Motel Morris (new American, Chelsea), Barboncino (Italian, Crown Heights) and Old John's Luncheonette (old American, Lincoln Square) just to name a few. Don't be afraid to call or email ahead and confirm, and there are folks at The Infatuation and Eater who have worked tirelessly to compile even more wide-ranging lists. (To be extra safe, consider having everyone in your party get tested before you meet up.)
I know there will never be a perfect answer from me, or from anyone for that matter. How and if you choose to dine is a deeply personal choice. But if you're Covid-conscious and feel alone, you have not been forgotten. Not by me and certainly not by the restaurant world. Going out just takes more research now -- a nice walk around your neighborhood is a great place to start -- and I hope this dispatch has been of some help to you or someone you care about.

Colorado Club Will Reopen After Attack That Killed Five: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nearly three months after a gunman killed five people and injured at least a dozen others at Club Q in Colorado Springs, the venue announced that it planned to reopen by the fall.
An L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in Colorado Springs where five people were killed in a mass shooting in November announced this week that it will reopen by the fall.
Club Q has been closed since a person wearing body armor and armed with an AR-15-style rifle walked in during a drag show just before midnight on Nov. 19, a Saturday night, and moved through the space as he opened fire.
In just a few minutes, five people were killed and more than a dozen others were injured before club patrons were able to subdue him.
Matthew Haynes, the founding owner of Club Q, said in a statement on Monday that members of the venue's staff "are working very hard to bring our home back."
"It has been two decades now that we have kept the doors open as a place where everyone, regardless of gender identity or who they love, had somewhere to belong," he said in the statement, which was posted to the Club Q Instagram account. "We look forward to being able to gather as one community again," he added.
The club's interior will be gutted and redesigned, the statement said. And there will be "enhanced security measures," including new screening technology and a "hardened" structure.
The redesigned club will also feature a "permanent standing tribute" to the five victims of the mass shooting: Kelly Loving, Daniel Aston, Derrick Rump, Ashley Paugh and Raymond Green Vance.
Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, faces more than 300 criminal counts, including 10 counts of first-degree murder and 86 counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors have suggested that the suspect harbored antipathy for the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
The announcement that Club Q would reopen was notable because the sites of mass shootings are often permanently closed or demolished.
An interim memorial now stands at the former location of Pulse, a queer nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where a gunman who proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded dozens of others in 2016. The onePULSE Foundation, a nonprofit group that is planning a $ 45-million National Pulse Memorial and Museum at the site, said on Tuesday that there were no plans to reopen the nightclub.
In Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, the school building was razed and rebuilt on a different part of the same property. At Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., the library where most of the 13 victims were killed during a shooting rampage in 1999 was closed and replaced with a new one.

Discussing Sex With Your Partner: [Science Desk]

Full text: First, simply acknowledge that you have it, says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. Then move on to some compliments.
Vanessa Marin has dedicated her career to discussing the most private details of other people's sex lives. But, for a long time, she found it hard to talk about her own.
In a new book, "Sex Talks: The Five Conversations That Will Transform Your Love Life," the sex therapist, 38, admits that she faked orgasms for 10 years because she couldn't bring herself to tell partners what she liked. Things improved when she met her husband, Xander Marin, now 37, but once the initial excitement wore off, the pair found themselves in front of an expensive couples counselor, struggling to articulate why their sex life sometimes felt disappointing.
Today, the Marins have parlayed their radical honesty and relatability into a business centered around sexual education, with a popular podcast, a suite of online courses and more than 300,000 followers on Instagram. Ms. Marin paints herself as someone who has often felt awkward and unsure in the bedroom, despite her professional credentials. Mr. Marin, who is not a therapist, says he offers a nonexpert perspective on what it takes to get more comfortable talking about sex.
"So many of us feel alone when we're struggling with sex," Ms. Marin explained. "Like, I must be broken; I must be the only person going through this; everyone else has a great sex life. So it feels important to me to lead with vulnerability."
The book, which the Marins co-wrote, is based on a simple -- and, they acknowledge, well-trodden -- conceit: Many sex problems stem from poor communication. Yet people seldom get specific and structured advice about how to have those conversations, the Marins believe. The book's five sex talks are centered around acknowledgment ("sex is a thing, and we have it"), connection, desire, pleasure and exploration.
"I've never had a relationship in which I talked about sex as openly, honestly or frequently as I now do with Xander. I've also never had a relationship in which the sex was as deeply intimate and wildly satisfying as it is now," Ms. Marin writes. "I don't think those two things are coincidences."
Here's what Ms. Marin had to say about why it can feel so daunting to talk about sex with our partners and about how to get started.
Questions and answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.
You write that most of us don't talk about sex often, if at all, with the person who regularly sees us naked. How do you suggest people start those conversations?
A big mistake people make is either they never talk about sex, or the only time they do acknowledge it is when there is a problem, so you sit down to have one of those "we need to talk" conversations. What we tell people is to incorporate talking about sex into their lives on a more regular basis. We recommend you start with giving compliments.
Try giving a compliment about your partner's physical attractiveness, or the attraction that you feel for them throughout the day. It could be something really tame like: "You look nice today" or "Your eyes are really beautiful." You can also offer some sort of compliment about the connection you feel. If you're giving them a hug hello or goodbye, you say, "It feels so good to be in your arms."
Compliments are an easy way to start talking about sex more openly. There are no goals to those conversations. You're not trying to accomplish anything. You're not making any requests or raising any complaints. There's a little flirtation in it.
You do write a lot about the importance of flirting and trying to create a sense of anticipation around sex. Why is that so important, and what if that kind of flirtation just isn't part of a couple's relationship anymore?
Many of us have this expectation that we should feel desire spontaneously out of nowhere, in the exact same moment our partner does. But that's just not how it works in real life. We write about an idea called the "sex drive simmer," which is about finding ways to maintain some of the sense of tension and anticipation that you may have had early on in your relationship throughout the day.
One thing a couple can do is exchange flirty text messages, and that doesn't mean that you're constantly texting back and forth. It could be something simple like, "Looking forward to seeing you later." Another thing that we love telling couples to do is to make a playlist of songs that get them in the mood. Just playing that in the background can also be a great way to keep that tension alive.
Part of the book focuses on building a foundation of sexual self-awareness, so people get to know what they enjoy and can eventually share that with a partner. What's a good first step?
I think anyone can think about the question: What does good sex mean to me? Try to be as detailed as you can about it and to come up with as many answers as you can.
You can kind of trace the arc of a sexual experience so: What is it that you like to feel leading up to sex? (Like, I like it when we've had some quality time together already that day.) It can get into how you like sex to be initiated. It could get into what kind of environment you like sex to happen in, and what energy you like to feel during sex. Is it passionate? Is it intimate? Is it safe? Silly? What do you like after?
It's very easy for us to focus on the problems with our sex life and our frustrations with it and not flip that around to ask: Well, what is it that I actually want?
You write a lot about awkwardness. For instance, you tell people who worry if it will feel strange to start having sex again after a dry spell that it probably will. And you write that awkwardness is the price of admission for good sex. Why?
When you see sex portrayed on TV or in the movies, everything flows, everything looks beautiful and perfect. But sex is a very awkward thing. Maybe you try a new position and it doesn't feel very good, or you can't figure it out. We really love just turning that on its head and saying it's not something to be afraid of or embarrassed about, it's something to embrace. If you anticipate awkwardness, that brings that pressure way down.
There's no way to grow up without some amount of sexual shame. We all have embarrassment that comes up around sex. We have areas of our sex life that we don't want to talk about. We're all in the same boat together in that sense. But it can make such a big difference in your life individually, and in your relationship, if you can tackle that head on.

They’re Big. They’re Red. But Are They Boots?

From the people who brought you cologne that smells like WD-40, “Birkinstock” sandals made from Birkin bags and Times Newer Roman, a font ever so slightly wider than Times New Roman, comes a hotly anticipated new release: the Big Red Boot.
The boots were created by MSCHF, a New York-based collective with a rich history of trolling consumer culture, sometimes doing so by selling consumer goods. Images of the boots, which are expected to go on sale Thursday, have captivated Twitter and TikTok with their absurdity.
It takes only a glance to understand why. The AirPod-shaped boots are globby from toe to ankle, at which point they jut straight up to midcalf. They are a shade of red that can only be described as “red,” recalling Babybel cheese, clown noses and Swedish Fish. And they are smooth — too smooth — as if a pair of Moon Boots were pumped full of Botox. They look more like the idea of a shoe than a shoe itself.
“Big Red Boots are REALLY not shaped like feet, but they are EXTREMELY shaped like boots,” the brand said in a news release.
They are, in a word, cartoonish — seemingly by design. (MSCHF calls the shoes “cartoon boots for a cool 3D world.”) Online, they have been compared to the footwear of the anime character Astro Boy and of Boots, the helpful sidekick of “Dora the Explorer.”
They began appearing on social media this month, in images from a photo shoot featuring the model Sarah Snyder and on the feet of Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. On TikTok, they racked up more than 20 million views. Commenters mocked the boots; headlines declared them “stupid,” “absurd” and divisive.
MSCHF rejected the idea that the boots were a joke. “It’s not a satire,” MSCHF said in a statement to The New York Times, after declining to be interviewed. “But what’s interesting is that we’re at a moment in time where it doesn’t have to be.” The group said the cartoonish aesthetic had been “mainstreamed enough” to make the Big Red Boot legible as, you know, a boot.
It is true that bulbous footwear has recently made it down runways for Loewe and Balenciaga, and that some other accessories, including handbags, have gotten puffy lately. In an all-caps “manifesto” about the boots, MSCHF pointed to Alexander McQueen’s similarly surreal “armadillo” shoes.
MSCHF may be releasing the boots with a straight face, but they are the work of a team that has long understood the relationship between divisiveness and virality. Members of the group have released a litany of pranks in the form of products since 2016, but MSCHF was officially founded in 2019, by Daniel Greenberg, Gabriel Whaley, Stephen Tetreault, Kevin Wiesner and Lukas Bentel (they are not fond of titles).
Some of the brand’s past outrage bait has courted sacrilege. (At the time of a 2020 feature in the Times, its office in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn had a decorative pentagram on the floor.) In a 2021 collaboration with Lil Nas X, it released “Satan Shoes”: Nike Air Max 97s that contained the blood of MSCHF team members. Nike swiftly sued.
“We’re OK being hated,” Greenberg told the Times that year. “We just don’t want apathy.”
This time around, the footwear seems to be finding an audience eager to be in on the joke.
“I’m getting to the point with fashion where I want to wear things that make no sense,” said Sophia Attie, 24, a paralegal in Brooklyn who owns a pair of light-up Crocs released in collaboration with 7-Eleven.
Attie said that she would not pay the boots’ $350 retail price, but that she liked the idea. “I want someone to look at my feet and go, ‘That’s dumb,’” she said.
“They remind me of Clifford the Big Red Dog,” said Jacinda Pender, 24, a model and makeup artist in Los Angeles who was also interested in owning the boots. “Like, OK, Clifford, I see you with the boots!”
Although the boots are not yet available to the public, the influencers and sneakerheads who have been sent pairs in advance of their official release have provided MSCHF with a bottomless well of social media fodder.
A pair of Big Red Boots in a size 10 arrived on the doorstep of Steve Natto, 25, a sneaker YouTuber in Philadelphia, on Feb. 1. He promptly gave them a test drive for his audiences on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.
“I tried doing casual walking; I even tried jumping in them,” he said, adding that he had received several follow-up comments asking if he could drive in them: “I’m not sure you can.”
A pair arrived on Monday at Bowery Showroom, a concept store and content house on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. (Natto and Matt Choon, the showroom’s CEO, were sent free pairs of the boots; both men said they were not paid to film content about them.)
Choon said customers had been coming in to film videos in the boots nonstop since they arrived. He said the store’s single pair would soon be on loan to rapper Fivio Foreign to wear in a music video.
“They have all of the elements to viral marketing: the influencers, the rollout,” Choon said. “Every single ingredient is there.”
Staff members have uploaded several videos of the boots to the showroom’s TikTok account. In one video that was filmed by Michael Pico, a stylist, a customer tries on the zipperless boots and gets stuck in them.
The showroom staff did eventually wrest them off — but only by pulling the customer’s leg. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Lizzo featuring SZA, 'Special'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Lizzo's soulful, gospel-choir-backed performance of "Special," the title track from her 2022 album, was a highlight of this year's Grammys telecast, and now she's recruited SZA to provide a fresh spin on the song. "You call it sensitive, and I call it superpower," SZA sings, nimbly skipping across the beat, while Lizzo offers her a message of solidarity: "I thought that I'd let you know, in case nobody told you today, you're special." If the original version was a more general anthem of uplift, SZA's presence gives the song a more intimate call-and-response quality, as if she and Lizzo were two girlfriends exchanging words of support after a long day. LINDSAY ZOLADZ
Beyoncé, 'Cuff It (Wetter Remix)'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's easy, and expected, to think about Beyoncé from the top down. On Sunday, she won four Grammys, giving her a career total of 32 and making her the most decorated performer in the show's history. Conversations about her music, how she assembles it and how she releases it often take on a world-historical tone. She is the defining superstar of the stan era, publicly available only every once in a while.
But she is listening. One of the more gratifying and unexpected turns of the "Renaissance" era has been her acknowledgment of how fans listen to her, responding in something like real time. First, in August, she formally released a mash-up of "Break My Soul" and Madonna's "Vogue" that had been floating around online.
Now, she's done it again. A few months ago, the D.J. and producer esentrik made a mash-up of "Cuff It" with "Wetter," a temperate love rap from 2009 by the Chicago fast talker Twista, produced by the Legendary Traxster. It was a hit on TikTok, and now, it's become something even more substantive. Beyoncé recorded new vocals for this version, which takes the sauciness of the original and cools it down slightly, leaning into afterglow.
Making this remix official is savvy acknowledgment that fans listen to music in ways artists can't anticipate, and it behooves artists to be mindful of how they're being consumed. And it is savvy business too, a way of formalizing the chaos of TikTok and bringing it under the umbrella of the empire. JON CARAMANICA
Jessie Ware, 'Pearls'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jessie Ware's latest disco-inspired track is an effervescent invitation to, as she puts it, "shake it til the pearls fall off." The single from her April album "That! Feels Good!" is thick with sumptuous atmosphere and Ware's signature sass. But most impressively, its chorus's ascending melody is a dazzling showcase of Ware's stratospheric upper register. Sing along at your own risk. ZOLADZ
Megan Moroney, 'I'm Not Pretty'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A razor-sharp premise for a song: "Somewhere out there my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend is scrolling through my Instagram/Tearing me down, passing the phone around." A young country singer with a voice that mixes sweetness with wryness, Megan Moroney targets this charming, funny, exhausted song at women who tear other women down. CARAMANICA
Luke Combs, 'Love You Anyway'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In midcareer mode, Luke Combs doesn't let it rip quite as often as he once did. His bellow is more stable, his emotional presence more dignified. But there's still something of a purring engine inside songs like "Love You Anyway," which in the hands of a lesser singer, would be a familiar, cloying ode to a love so strong, it's worth the pain of potentially losing it. But when Combs sings, "If your kiss turned me to stone, I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome," he sounds like he's thoroughly pondered the consequences -- the likelihood of heartbreak -- and is pressing on with force nonetheless. CARAMANICA
Indigo de Souza, 'Younger & Dumber'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Younger & Dumber," from the Asheville singer-songwriter Indigo De Souza, is a slow-burning tear-jerker, a gradual accumulation of heartbreaking lines that takes flight in a soaring climax. "Sometimes I just don't want to be alone, and it's not because I'm lonely," De Souza sings in a wearied croon. "It's just that I get so tired of filling the space all around me." But just then, her voice swells in intensity and fills that space with her own wrenching emotion. ZOLADZ
Yaya Bey, 'Exodus the North Star'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Brooklyn's Yaya Bey brings a light touch to "Exodus the North Star," the title track from an upcoming EP that follows her excellent 2022 album "Remember Your North Star." "Exodus" is a love-struck reverie that begins as a sparse arrangement -- just Bey's voice and some celestial keys -- but soon explodes into a joyful, horn-kissed celebration. "Baby, it's the way you make me feel like your girl could get up and fly," Bey sings and, accordingly, the song suddenly takes flight. ZOLADZ
French Montana featuring 2Rare, "Ratataaaaa'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Turns out that French Montana's meandering smears, typically at home over lightly galloping production, sound equally intriguing over sounds twice as quick. This song (which perhaps is an allusion to an old TikTok meme) is jubilant and spacious, and a little odd. The Philadelphia club rapper 2Rare, who guests here, is more naturally bouncy than his host, but his antic energy is mostly a counterweight to French Montana's impressionistic almost-raps.

A Way to Fight Back on Overseas Transaction Fees: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Travelers fed up with lousy exchange rates and punitive foreign transaction fees are signing up for apps that let them decide where the buck (or euro or pound) stops.
Jet lag aside, almost nothing can dull that post-vacation glow more than a huge credit card bill packed with inscrutable foreign transaction fees.
In April, Lise Boissiere, a frequent traveler, decided she'd had enough of those unexpected buzz kills. Ms. Boissiere, who lives in London and works in human resources, decided to follow friends' advice and open a multicurrency account. These types of accounts allow travelers to exchange their money at more favorable rates and with little to no transaction fees. They can then hold the money in various currencies and spend it using their phone or a card in the currency of whatever country they're visiting.
Mr. Boissiere signed up for Revolut, one of the most popular online providers of these accounts, and was approved in six minutes, she said. Now she uses the Revolut app to pay for everything from croissants in France to Ubers in Spain. "It's been transformative," Ms. Boissiere said. "I could have saved myself lots of money by using it sooner."
Tourists traveling abroad have long struggled to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of credit cards, debit cards and currency exchanges -- worse rates and lower fees versus better rates and higher fees. Now, multicurrency accounts are changing the calculus.
Even though some credit and debit cards waive foreign transaction fees, multicurrency accounts often have more favorable exchange rates, said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst with the financial advice service Bankrate.com in New York. At the end of January, $ 10 would get Revolut users 9.21 euros, while Visa customers would get €9.15. But once Visa's typical 3 percent foreign transaction fee was factored in, they would get €8.88.
Multicurrency accounts really stand out in contrast to cash, Mr. Rossman said. "Those exchange rates can be much worse, especially at airports and in tourist centers," he said. "I think that's the legacy model they're looking to displace."
Revolut, which currently has 26 million users, is only one of the services that offer these accounts. Other options include Wise (formerly TransferWise), Chime and Monito, as well as more traditional institutions like Citibank, HSBC and East West Bank (though the bigger banks may charge steep monthly fees and have high minimum balance requirements).
Online services like Revolut and Wise have ceilings on how much you can withdraw from A.T.M.s at no charge, and there are limits on how much and when currency exchanges can be made with no fees. These accounts also may not have the fraud and dispute protections of standard credit and debit cards.
Thinking of making one of these accounts part of your next trip? Here's what you need to know:
How do multicurrency accounts work?
These accounts, which may be used for personal or business purposes, let travelers hold, spend, transfer and toggle between multiple currencies. If you're using Revolut, for example, you can link your bank account through Apple Pay or Google Pay, load the currency of your home country into your account, and exchange it into 29 currencies -- including U.S. dollars, British pounds, euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and South African rand -- whenever the rate is favorable. You can add funds to a Revolut account in 17 currencies via bank transfer or debit card as well as with Apple Pay or Google Pay. Other Revolut users can also send you money through the app.
You can spend the money in most multicurrency accounts with either a phone tap or a physical card, which is available at no charge. When you're making a purchase abroad with Revolut, the app or card defaults to the local currency. If you don't have enough of that currency in your Revolut account, the service will exchange on the spot at the lowest rate. You can also make a currency exchange via the app at any time to take advantage of an especially favorable rate.
How are they different from regular credit or debit cards?
Many debit and credit cards charge a fee (3 percent is standard for U.S. and Canadian credit card companies) to use overseas. The multicurrency accounts charge no foreign transaction fees (unless otherwise stated) and use the lowest exchange rates possible. (The services make money on subscriptions as well as the fees that merchants pay on transactions, among other things, Mr. Rossman said.)
Where can they be used?
The majority of multicurrency accounts can be used wherever Visa or Mastercard is accepted, said Michael Bodansky, the head of corporate communications for Revolut, which is based in London. Currently, anyone living in most areas of North America, Europe, Japan, Singapore or Australia can open a Revolut account. The service is planning to expand to customers in New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico and India soon.
How do you set up an account?
Download the app for the multicurrency account and provide some basic personal information such as your name, address and Social Security number. For most people, it should take no longer than 10 minutes to be approved for any of the apps. If you choose, a card will be mailed to you, but you can start using the Revolut app, which is linked to your bank account via Apple Pay or Google Pay, immediately.
What are the fees?
They vary by the plan you choose and your country of residence. In the United States, Revolut's standard plan, for example, has no monthly fee and includes exchanges of all currencies up to $ 1,200 per month at no charge on weekdays, and with a 1 percent fee on the weekends. (If you want to use the app abroad on a weekend without paying a fee, you can transfer into a new currency on a weekday.) If you exchange more than $ 1,200 per month, there is a fee of 0.5 percent for additional transfers. You can also make unlimited withdrawals from A.T.M.s in the Allpoint network, and up to $ 1,200 per month without fees outside the network, though the A.T.M.'s owner may still impose a fee. After that, Revolut charges 2 percent on withdrawals.
Wise -- which also has no monthly fee for the base plan and offers 49 currencies -- charges a minimal A.T.M. fee depending on where your card was issued. For example, if a Wise account was opened in the United States, you may make two withdrawals of up to $ 100 total every month with no fees, but after that, Wise charges $ 1.50 per transaction plus 2 percent of the total amount withdrawn plus whatever fee the A.T.M.'s owner imposes.
What are the cons?
One major potential drawback is that most credit cards come with fraud and dispute protections, while multicurrency accounts may not, said Wei Zhang, a section chief at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency. And not all the companies that offer multicurrency accounts are licensed banks, though many do team up with banks to offer F.D.I.C. deposit protection of up to $ 250,000. Finally, you have to be mindful of how much you withdraw from A.T.M.s to avoid racking up fees, and be aware of the days you're using the app to avoid weekend exchange charges.

This Winnie the Pooh Has a Nasty Attitude: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When the gentle bear fell into the public domain, a horror director pounced. Glimpses of the low-budget film have enthralled and enraged fans.
Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Christopher Robin and other denizens of the Hundred Acre Wood will be back on the big screen this month. Just don't expect delightful animation, whimsical songs or heartwarming themes of young innocence and imagination. The new movie is spectacularly unsuitable for children: It's a gore-splattered, live-action sequel out of a nightmare, featuring a terrifying pair of psychopaths who commit gruesome murders.
The villains? Pooh and Piglet themselves. The Bear of Very Little Brain is now a hulking, hollow-eyed monster, standing over six feet tall, with a sinister goofy grin on his yellow silicone face. His trusty companion, no longer pocket-sized, has the tusks and snout of a boar. As for the lovably mopey Eeyore, he has been mauled to death.
The title? "Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey."
No, Disney has not lost the plot. What the company has lost, though, are the exclusive rights to some of its most beloved characters. On Jan. 1, 2022, the copyright to A.A. Milne's 1926 book, "Winnie-the-Pooh," expired, entering the public domain, and leaving Pooh and friends essentially up for grabs.
"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey," the feature filmmaking debut of Rhys Frake-Waterfield, will be released in the United States next week. Early glimpses have generated considerable online chatter, much of it of the so-bad-it's-good variety. "I laugh-cried through the whole damn video," Reddit user SweetPinkSocks commented on the trailer. "It's going to be terrible but ... I have to see it." In January, IMDb's official list of the most anticipated movies of 2023 had the movie at No. 2, behind Greta Gerwig's "Barbie."
The hype, though, has been indivisible from the social-media outrage. Frake-Waterfield has been barraged with messages -- including death threats -- accusing him of corrupting minds and, yes, ruining childhoods. "Please don't taint our innocent childhood memories with this," one commenter, Kelia Chaquetta, wrote on his Instagram. "It's like we intentionally find ways to put more evil into the world than good."
On a video call, Frake-Waterfield said, "I am out to destroy all seven billion childhoods," then added, "Just kidding."
Only a few years ago, he was working in corporate strategy for a multinational energy company in Britain. He quit his job and started dabbling in the film industry -- visual effects, set design, cinematography -- eventually finding a knack for producing. In a little over a year, he produced about 25 straight-to-DVD movies with titles like "Dinosaur Hotel," "Croc!" and "The Area 51 Incident."
Then Frake-Waterfield decided he might as well give directing a go. As a fan, he was drawn to horror, but not so-called elevated horror. He wanted to scare, shock and sicken. He just needed a strong, marketable premise. As he explained it: "Horror needs a hook."
When he heard that Winnie the Pooh was no longer protected by copyright, an appropriately horrific idea began to form. What could be more attention-grabbing than that absent-minded bear starring in something like "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"? The concept came together with the brutal clarity of a sprung bear trap. The whole twisted appeal, Frake-Waterfield said, is that "it doesn't feel like it should exist."
Frake-Waterfield had no particular fondness for or connection to the character or the stories growing up. So he read the original Milne book for the first time. He also familiarized himself with copyright law, which stipulated that in this case, anything introduced after 1926 was off-limits. That included Pooh's red shirt. Tigger, too, was out of bounds, since he didn't show up until 1928 in Milne's "The House at Pooh Corner"; he bounces into the public domain in 2024.
"I'm not a lawyer. Parody and trademark law kind of goes over my head a little bit," he said. "But I do understand that if something's gone into the public domain, it's free rein."
Actually, there is one caveat, because Disney still owns the trademark for the characters: Any new non-Disney usage of Pooh and the rest should not be easily mistaken as coming from Disney.
"Copyright is principally concerned with works of creative expression, while trademarks are used to identify goods or services as coming from a particular source," said Aaron J. Moss, a lawyer specializing in copyright and trademark law. "So long as the new film uses only material that's in the public domain, Disney wouldn't have a copyright claim. But Disney could have a trademark claim if the film were marketed in a way that makes it look like the film was somehow associated with or approved by Disney."
Not that there's much chance of that here. In the new telling, Christopher Robin grows up and goes off to college, leaving Pooh, Piglet and the rest behind. When he returns to his old stomping grounds as a young man, girlfriend in tow, he finds that his old buddies' brutish animal instincts have taken over, turning them into sadistic killers. Now the former besties are locked in a battle to the death.
In other ways, the movie is faithful to the source material. Pooh really loves honey, for example.
Frake-Waterfield wrote the screenplay, paying particular attention to making the death scenes as shockingly awful as possible. Torture, decapitation and a meat grinder are all involved. One of the director's major inspirations was "Wrong Turn," the horror franchise populated by deformed cannibals.
Pooh's paws in the film are human hands in rubber gloves. But to be clear, this Pooh and Piglet are not serial killers in masks. They are, more frighteningly, bizarre half-animal, half-man hybrids of unknown origin and supernatural-seeming indestructibility.
The film was shot over a few days in Ashdown Forest, Sussex, the setting that inspired the Hundred Acre Wood. Amber Doig-Thorne, who plays one of the characters terrorized by Pooh, read the books as a child and owned the toys. Being kidnapped and terrorized by a larger-than-life version of the bear, slobbering globs of honey into her eyes, was strange, to say the least.
"I never thought I'd see one of my favorite childhood characters behead someone, or run a woman over with a car," she said.
Early excitement surrounding "Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" was so great that the cast and crew reassembled for several more days of reshoots. The body count grew, and some of the deaths became even more extreme. Originally intended as another straight-to-DVD affair, the movie will now be getting a weekslong theatrical release. Already, it has racked up nearly $ 1 million at the box office in Mexico, where it opened in January.
Part of the appeal is surely that the movie feels like an act of cheeky defiance against Disney. In a time when the company is systematically rebooting its various properties, "Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" takes advantage of the brand awareness around Pooh, while also taking an ax to the brand. Think of it as gratuitous anti-nostalgia, the reboot from hell. (The company did not respond to a request for comment.)
As for the online detractors, Frake-Waterfield is nonplused.
"It's a view I really struggle to understand," he said. "The only people who see this film are grown adults that want to watch it. I also just can't relate to the idea of watching something obviously fictitious and saying it's destroyed something in their mind. There's way worse things happening in the world."
A sequel has already been announced, suggesting that Pooh has every chance of becoming the next Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers. Frake-Waterfield is excited by the horror-making potential of other characters in the stories, like Rabbit and Owl. But maybe, Frake-Waterfield suggests, his next horror venture won't be a matter of public domain opportunism. "Maybe I could do it with Disney."

Making Sure Wedding Moms Don't Feel Overlooked: [Society Desk]

Full text: Allison Kaplan, the editor in chief of Twin Cities Business, discusses a new website designed to help women find the right outfits for their children's weddings.
If Allison Kaplan had a rallying cry, it would be, "Down with the sequined jacket!"
Last October, Ms. Kaplan and her business partner, Betsey Kershaw, both of whom are from the Minneapolis area, founded Mother Of, an online resource designed to help mothers or mother figures find the perfect look for their children's weddings.
"The mother of the bride dress is so tired and matronly, for so many women, it's a very intimidating purchase," said Ms. Kaplan, who is known as Ali. "There tends to be this outdated assumption that if you're the mother, you want to wear a little jacket with sequins on it."
The website doesn't sell dresses directly, but displays a curated collection of dresses, jumpsuits and suits from various online retailers chosen by Ms. Kaplan, with her appraisal of each item. For the modern mother of the bride or groom, she suggests fancy jumpsuits, dresses and tops with "flutter sleeves" and yes, even wearing black.
There are categories for daytime, black tie, cocktail, destination and suits, with featured outfits ranging in price from around $ 100 to more than $ 1,000.
There are also photos and stories from real women and the dresses they chose.
"Baby Boomer and Gen X women just don't relate to this matronly, fade-into-the-background archetype of the mother of the bride, and they've raised evolved children who don't see them that way, either," said Ms. Kaplan. "But the fashion industry hasn't caught up."
Ms. Kaplan, 50, is also editor in chief of Twin Cities Business, as well as the former style editor for Mpls.St.Paul Magazine. She is the public face of the Mother Of brand, appearing on camera describing aspects of dresses in short videos on Instagram and TikTok. Ms. Kershaw, 58, who handles the back-end maintenance of the website and maintains their social media accounts, is the founder of her own Minneapolis-based social media agency, BK & Co.
Neither have been mothers of brides or grooms yet.
You haven't been a "mother of," so how did this idea come about?
For years, I've done a local radio show about fashion and shopping with my mother, called "ShopGirls with Ali & Harmony," and nearly every week, we get a call from a distressed mother of the bride who doesn't know how to shop for this dress. Now, it's even harder as so many stores have closed because of Covid. Even for women who are comfortable shopping online, scrolling through thousands of dresses is time consuming and lonely. I wanted to help more women than I could talk to directly through radio show call-ins or email.
Mother Of cuts through the clutter. The dresses we feature are modern, but chosen with mothers of the bride and groom in mind. The real moms we feature provide helpful context of what a dress will look like on someone who is petite or curvy. The descriptions say things like: "We like this because it has that flutter sleeve, which is super flattering."
Why is this such a challenging purchase?
Women still want to feel young and look great, but this event often comes at a time when they're feeling a little insecure about their bodies. Women are intimidated by this purchase because this event feels so monumental in their lives and their family's lives. It's a really big day, but not about them, so they don't want to take up too much space and yet they want to look amazing. They also just want reassurance, like "Can I wear pants?" or "Is it too sexy?" They're wanting community around this decision, and validation.
Women over 50 don't feel like anyone is talking to them. First and foremost, we are creating a hub for a group of overlooked women, with spending power, where they know that they are the focus.
What are you learning from featuring real women and what they wore?
So many women see a dress they like on a 6-foot-tall model who is size zero and can't relate because they can't picture it on themselves. We always see the larger sizes sell out first. It's so obvious that a broader range of sizes, styles and silhouettes that suit more women are needed.
Not everyone has a friend to go shopping with, especially now, with so many people shopping online. A lot of women don't trust their own judgment, and there tends to be a lot of rules around a wedding: "Is it OK to wear black or not?" "Should it be long or short?" and then there are the added factors around destination weddings that make many women think, "I have no idea what to wear."
Given your demographic, is it surprising that you have a strong following on TikTok?
My partner knew TikTok would be a big component of this. We are deep in wedding TikTok, where I've never lived before. There, we're talking to brides who want to help their moms and soon-to-be mothers-in-law. As we post more videos, women appreciate seeing real women with real bodies. It's comforting, inspiring, and reassuring, and that's a huge part of what we want to do.
Today's moms are starting companies and taking risks; they're talking openly about menopause and living full, healthy, vibrant lives well after their children leave the nest. They need a shopping experience to reflect the modern, confident way they feel. As much as this day is so important to the mom, she doesn't get the moment for herself. We're giving women that moment and they deserve it, they're the moms. They get the "you look amazing" in the comments, and it's fun for them to have their moment, too.
How are you funding this endeavor?
It wasn't a huge lift to get started, mostly just our time. But we plan to explore affiliate marketing and advertising, with the advertising remaining separate from the content. We also could expand to adjacent categories, as this same woman needs shoes, accessories, and a dress for the rehearsal dinner.

Harry Styles Ate Here. Fans Flock.: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At 9:30 a.m. on a Thursday, the Harrys began to arrive at Beachwood Cafe. Young women with neon hair extensions, colorful crocheted cardigans and shirts illustrated with cherries, sunflowers and the word "Pleasing" piled out of rental cars and Ubers. They were trailed by their mothers and filming on their phones. By 10:30, the mom-and pop eatery, which has been around since the 1970s in the heart of Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles, had a 30-minute wait, and a swarm of teenage girls taking photos in front of its blue door.
Who are the Harrys? They are Harry Styles superfans, and hordes of them have been making the pilgrimage to Beachwood Cafe, a cheerful spot with an all-day menu off a small village square, since December 2019. That's when the superstar briefly name-checked the restaurant in the song "Falling": "And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe," he sang. That one line -- which Styles-olgoists believe to be about his ex Camille Rowe, a former Beachwood Canyon resident -- sent a bat signal.
"I just felt like coming here would complete the whole Harry Styles experience," said Caysey Gossweiler, 27, who traveled from Maryland to attend one of the three concerts that Mr. Styles would perform at the Kia Forum that weekend in late January.
"It's panic-inducing; I could literally evaporate thinking about it," said Noelle Jay, 26, of being in the same space where Mr. Styles once ate eggs. "He's like a god," added her cousin Mia Tucci, 17, whose hair was a shade of Kelly green. "He's like my comfort person, my light, my inspiration, all of the above," Ms. Jay replied.
Nearby, Nathan Freeman, 26, and his wife, Shannon Freeman, 25, were taking photos of Taylor Anderson and Alyson Johnston -- 20-year-old college students from Oregon they had just met. "It was like -- where should we go for breakfast? Harry told us where to go!" Mr. Freeman said gleefully.
The couple, who wore matching crop top and bell bottom ensembles to attend the concert at the Forum, had spent the previous day at Sycamore Cove Beach in Malibu, where fans say Mr. Styles filmed the videos for "Watermelon Sugar" and the One Direction song "What Makes You Beautiful."
"She ran and screamed and fan-girled," Mr. Freeman said, describing his wife's behavior upon arriving at the beach. "I was like, ah!" he shrieked. "I love this for you!"
Ms. Freeman said she admired Mr. Styles for his kindness. "I've never seen a scandal from him ever -- which is amazing."
Over avocado toast at a table inside, Ms. Anderson -- who made her family do a detour during an Amalfi Coast vacation to visit a street where Mr. Styles filmed parts of the "Golden" music video (she found the location by searching Google Maps for landmarks in the background of the behind-the-scenes video) -- offered her perspective on the fandom. "It's a family in a lot of ways," she said. "A good example of how the online world connects people."
Ms. Johnston finished watching a video on her phone of Mr. Styles doing Pilates, via the fan account Harry Florals, and added: "You can just kind of look at someone, and if they're our age and wearing clothes that resemble the Harry style it's like, OK, these are people you can talk to who are nice."
"The term is 'Harry coded,"' explained Xoee Margolis, 26, who was wearing neon orange Adidas Gazelles (inspired by ones Mr. Styles wears from the Gucci/Adidas collaboration). She held two new Beachwood Market totes in her hand, which she'd seen while browsing the cafe's merch section online from her home in New York City. "Wearing a little cherry is an ode to the 'Cherry' song, carrying around a Beachwood bag the shoes are Harry-coded -- it's a vibe."
"I made the mistake of not bringing in merch earlier," said the cafe's owner, Mike Fahim. But when he discovered eBay and Etsy accounts selling knockoff merchandise for his restaurant, he saw a business opportunity.
When Mr. Fahim took over the cafe in the fall of 2019, the crowd was a mix of locals, tourists headed to the nearby Hollywood sign, business lunches from film studios, and celebrities flying under the radar. In early 2020, the clientele started shifting to Gen Z girls and young women -- some of whom bring cardboard cutouts of Styles for photos -- and, in some cases, their parents.
Mr. Fahim, who had never heard of Harry Styles, embraced the affiliation.
Now, the tip jar says "Harry Tips Here." A sign depicted in a mural declares "The Coffee's Out," referring to the line in the song featuring Beachwood. And he and his staff are happy to take photos and answer fans' questions about what Mr. Styles is said to have eaten (the Beachwood Scramble), and where he sat (the table at the center of the room, and the booth in the far right corner). Someone on the staff monitors "the whole situation on Instagram and TikTok," Mr. Fahim said. If Mr. Styles is in town -- as he was for two weeks in the fall, when the cafe ran out of menu items and merchandise -- they double up on staff and supplies.
On the Saturday of Mr. Styles's concert run at the Forum, a line started forming outside of the cafe an hour before opening. It included Emma Szumowski, 21, from Massachusetts, who stood with her parents, Laura and Steve McMahon. The concert she'd gone to the previous evening was her sixth time seeing Mr. Styles. She had tickets for one more show in Los Angeles and two in Palm Springs that week.
"I get it, I'm a big Springsteen fan -- I started following him around in '84," said Mr. McMahon, 58, who, at his daughter's request, had gotten up early to be second in line.
The line snaked past the dry cleaners and into the square. At 8:40 a.m., Nicholas Braun, the actor who plays Cousin Greg on "Succession," joined it -- appearing slightly bewildered by the crowd -- and then left before he was seated.
Across the street, Jim Krantz, 67, and Brian Burchfield, 59, Beachwood Canyon residents, stood outside the Hollywoodland Realty building, taking in the scene.
"I mean, this was like 'Mayberry R.F.D.' -- but not anymore," said Mr. Krantz, sipping a mug of tea and referencing the 1968 spinoff of "The Andy Griffith Show" -- a sentence likely to draw a blank with the teenage girls filming their breakfast burritos across the street.
"I think it's fascinating, a social phenomenon," he added. "But it's a bit of an inconvenience when it comes to being able to do your daily life up here."
Wait times were between two and three hours throughout the weekend. At one point on Saturday, the diners inside the cafe broke out into a loud rendition of "Falling." Before the wave of Styles fans, Mr. Fahim typically served 300 guests from Friday to Sunday; he now serves 1,000 on average. The locals still come, but they often grumble about the wait times and lack of parking -- and if they see a line, they steer clear.
Most fans agreed that this was no longer a place where Mr. Styles was likely to set foot. This realization sometimes prompted fan conspiracy theories -- did he mention the cafe because he knew it would send fans flocking there, and it was too painful a place to return because of its romantic history there? But even if that were the case, "it's cool to envision him sitting in there being all sad and lonely," said Bryn Langrock, 23.
And if Mr. Styles did dine at Beachwood Cafe again, Mr. Fahim says he knows what he'd tell him: "Thank you."

Hayley Williams Is Fueled by Tea and Thrifting: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As Paramore releases its sixth album, "This Is Why," the singer and songwriter chats about playing in a maturing band -- and the music, mushrooms and tinctures that have aided that journey.
Hayley Williams is only 34, but she is already two decades into her career as the dynamic frontwoman for the pop-punk band Paramore. "I was just saying to the guys, we're too young to be old, but too old to be young," she said with a laugh last month, referring to her bandmates, the guitarist Taylor York and the drummer Zac Farro. "There's people that think of us the way I think of artists that have been doing this way longer than us. Part of me feels 85, and the other part feels like I have no answers to life."
Aside from the fiery hues of her signature hair, Williams is a very different person from the teenager who formed Paramore in 2004. She has survived a painful divorce, the acrimonious exits of several band members (including Farro, who quit in 2010 but returned in 2017), and delved into deeply personal material on two solo albums released in 2020 and 2021.
Likewise, Paramore's sixth album, "This Is Why" (out Friday), bears little resemblance to the howling emo of its youth, reveling in the spiky new wave and funkier syncopations of its 2017 LP "After Laughter," all topped by Williams's lush, versatile voice. The group's latest single, the hyper "C'est Comme Ça," nods to its maturity: "I hate to admit getting better is boring/But the high cost of chaos?/Who can afford it?"
"We're much better friends to each other," Williams said. "I remember calling my manager two Christmases ago and being like, 'I didn't get you a gift other than to say that we finally figured out how to talk through our problems."'
As she prepared for "This Is Why," Paramore's first album in six years, Williams credited her first solo album, "Petals for Armor," with building confidence in her own musical prowess. It also empowered her to look outward as she grappled with the trauma of the pandemic and processed racial injustice near her Nashville home during lockdown. "Mostly, the lyrics are a disdain for resistance to progress," she said. "We went through all this, and people are still absolute [expletive] to each other."
From Farro's rental studio in Nashville, where Williams's goldendoodle, Alf, hunted for crumbs, the singer and songwriter shared what has inspired and comforted her as her band revved up once again. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
1. Mushrooms I feel like something happened when [the film] "Fantastic Fungi" came out. It opened up a lot of people's minds to all the ways mushrooms can be used. [The chef and writer] Sophia Roe has this amazing Instagram account and a new show called "Counter Space," and she uses mushrooms a lot for plant-based cooking. Mentally, too, the effects that they can have on someone -- I'm not speaking from experience here, but I'm very excited to do a guided session and see how it affects my journey with depression and PTSD. And "The Last of Us" is blowing my mind; I love that mushrooms have become such a thing that now the zombies on a TV show have mushroom faces. Taylor and I were watching it the other night, and I was like, I'm the first person to turn. I take this coffee alternative called Everyday Dose, and it has all these cordyceps. I'm definitely a goner.
2. Starface Pimple Stickers When I would break out in my early 20s, I was petrified for any show or photo shoot. We opened up for No Doubt, and I remember trying to ask Gwen Stefani, like, "Did you ever have acne?" She was like, "Oh, I think I struggled when we toured in the van." I wasn't a big makeup-wearer so I didn't know what to do. I love that there's this new generation of skin care that's like: Celebrate it. Decorate your face. Connect the dots.
3. Jonah Hill's "Stutz" We watched this documentary in the front lounge of our bus on this last run, which was our first tour in a very long time. I was having anxiety around not being home. It was so meaningful. I love that Jonah Hill is a very well-respected actor, a great filmmaker and he's like: I'm going to take care of myself before I worry about being a product. That's why we took four years off. We've never gotten to experience the world through any other filter than Paramore, and that's privilege. People might say, "Yeah, well, you already had success." But it's very hard to walk away from opportunities. I've done some pretty intense therapy.
4. A24 Horror Films I grew up with my grandfather taking me to Blockbuster. We would rent "Pet Sematary" or whatever, and we would run around the woods behind his apartment and search for ghosts. What I love most is when the genre takes on social issues, like "The Babadook" or Jordan Peele movies. And Ari Aster's films for A24 are some of my favorites: "Hereditary," obviously, and "Midsommar." A24 feels so artistic. I was even into "Lamb."
5. Rozi Plain's "Prize" Basically, this is the first record that I've had on repeat since SZA's album came out last year. Taylor introduced me to her music. It's got such warmth to it. I listened to all of Jessica Pratt's records throughout the pandemic, which was so comforting, and Rozi Plain feels like that.
6. Pique Tea I love herbal tea. My favorite is rooibos. I attended a Moroccan tea ceremony right before the pandemic hit, and I wanted to learn more about what tea means in different cultures. So I ordered a few things from Tea Huntress here in Nashville. But Pique Tea is great. There's all this science and ritualization that goes into it that I found really helpful.
7. DYEposit I'm a little horrified because it's a product that my hair dye company, Good Dye Young, released last year, but I genuinely use this once a week. [The actress] Jane Asher was the poster on the walls of my mind as we were planning looks for this tour -- a little bit strawberry blonde. I use copper DYEposit, and it keeps me from having to re-dye my hair all the time.
8. Alexis Smart Flower Remedies It's kind of like Bach Rescue Remedy. You can go on her website and pick these tinctures based on where you're at, not where you want to be. I purchased a few for social anxiety, as we're getting ready to be around people again, and for any time I feel impostor syndrome. I wish I'd known about this for "Petals for Armor" because I would have been like, "Yo, can we make a blend?"
9. Pre-Owned Clothes Growing up, the guys and I shopped at thrift stores almost exclusively. In high school, everyone wanted to look like, I don't know, Phantom Planet. I didn't have money, and it was cool. Now it's for the planet. I hate buying something without any thought and then getting rid of it two months later. I collect vintage T-shirts. I made a decision that when I buy for my personal closet, I will go to Depop or B.Real. It's a way into sustainability for people that really love fashion.
10. "Play Time" Solange just composed this beautiful music for a ballet called "Play Time" that was choreographed by Gianna Reisen. I'm going to take my mom to New York in May before we get busy on the U.S. tour. My mom was a ballerina and was injured early on. Later, she worked for the National Dance Institute under Jacques d'Amboise. My 10,000 hours has obviously gone in a different direction, but ballet resonates so much with me.

Full text: Cody Kolodziejzyk and Kelsey Kreppel have become famous for podcasting about their lives, but kept their proposal mostly personal -- seal carcass and all.
In a relationship open to perusal by millions of followers, the podcasters Cody Michael Kolodziejzyk and Kelsey Lang Kreppel have made a practice of not letting their favorite moments turn into content.
One such moment was their Dec. 18, 2021, engagement on the beach in Malibu, Calif. They could have played the giant seal carcass that had washed ashore at Mr. Kolodziejzyk's proposal site for laughs. But, Ms. Kreppel said, "even though I film our day-to-day life and people know a lot of what's going on with us, Cody and I are really mindful about what we share and what we keep just for us."
Ms. Kreppel, 29, and Mr. Kolodziejzyk, 32, live in Los Angeles. They have separate YouTube channels but collaborate on certain series, including "Couples Cringe." Both have built an audience on playful musings.
Mr. Kolodziejzyk, who shortened his professional name to Ko at the start of his media career, is known, among other things, for co-hosting the "Tiny Meat Gang" podcast with Noel Miller. Ms. Kreppel, a vlogger known for her red-carpet fashion reviews, runs a fashion and accessories line, TRULUVE, and hosts a podcast called "Circle Time."
The couple met at Ms. Kreppel's Mar Vista, Calif., apartment in June 2017, when one of her roommates invited friends over. Mr. Kolodziejzyk, who had a following on the short-lived platform Vine and was just starting to get attention on YouTube, was among them. He had heard the apartment housed cute women. "I was like, 'hubba hubba,"' he said.
He remembers what Ms. Kreppel was wearing the second he saw her: a cutoff Frank Sinatra T-shirt, jeans and a black choker. "I thought she had a really cool style and was really beautiful," he said.
Ms. Kreppel, then a preschool teacher in North Hollywood, liked him right away, too. "I felt like I could be funny and kind of silly around him, and he was understanding that side of me," she said.
By the time they said good night, they had taken the cinnamon challenge together (he choked, she didn't) and separated themselves from the others to snack on hard-boiled eggs out of the refrigerator. "He was kind of hungry and I was like, 'This is the only thing I can offer you,"' she said.
Later that night, she messaged him on Instagram. "I sent him something really ridiculous about eating hard-boiled eggs again next time," she said. "It was not cute at all." But he responded.
Ms. Kreppel is from Los Angeles. She graduated from California State University, Northridge, with a bachelor's degree in child and adolescent development. Mr. Kolodziejzyk, who grew up in Calgary, Alberta, received a bachelor's degree in computer science from Duke University.
After the cinnamon and egg encounter, Mr. Kolodziejzyk spent the next month visiting a friend in Europe. While he was gone, they texted regularly about "Love Island," a hit in London. "Everyone was talking about it," Mr. Kolodziejzyk said. They got hooked on the series together.
When he returned to Los Angeles in July, they reunited at the Lincoln, a bar in Venice, for a mutual friend's birthday party. "We sat there holding hands and talking to each other the whole time," Ms. Kreppel said. On his way home, Mr. Kolodziejzyk texted a friend. "I was like, I met my wife, basically," he said. That September, on a trip to San Diego, he asked her to be his girlfriend.
"Couples Cringe," in which they dissect unfortunate internet behavior together, debuted in 2018, the year they moved to a small apartment together in Marina Del Ray. They found less time for mutual cringing in 2019 when "Tiny Meat Gang" won a Shorty Award for best podcast. "I was on tour for like the entire year, and sometimes that got a little difficult," Mr. Kolodziejzyk said.
The pandemic put an end to what was beginning to feel like a long distance relationship. In 2020, the two moved out of the apartment in Marina del Rey and into a house in Venice, where they quarantined. There, constant togetherness pushed them toward more filming as a duo. This was OK with their separate audiences. "We have the exact same sense of humor," Mr. Kolodziejzyk said. "People like us as a unit. It was natural."
The seal carcass that washed ashore shortly before he proposed in 2021 was natural, too. But that didn't stop him from worrying it would wreck the moment. "It was gigantic and it smelled, and no one wants to see a carcass on the day of their engagement," he said.
It was too late to ask her to marry him elsewhere: Yards away, a surprise Champagne picnic put together by a company he had hired was waiting. "In my head I was thinking, What are we supposed to do? Just hope she doesn't notice?"
She did notice. But her reaction after she said yes reinforced the feeling they were made for each other. "She took a selfie with it," he said. "That's how I know she's the one."
On Feb. 4, Mr. Kolodziejzyk and Mr. Kreppel were married at the Sands Hotel and Spa in Indian Wells, Calif., by their friend Adam Cue, with Emma Feitshans, another friend, participating in the ceremony. Both were ordained by American Marriage Ministries for the occasion.
Their 150 guests didn't have to be camera-ready for their millions of fans. The wedding was "not for money or for videos or for likes," Ms. Kreppel said. "It was for love. And it was just for us."

At a gas station near Bethungra, three people squabbled over who would buy him lunch. At a train station in Junee, a bearded man offered him shelter. And in small towns along Australia’s back roads, encounters with strangers have led to offers of hot showers and warm beds; beer and burgers; and heartfelt, even tearful conversations, conducted mostly via Google Translate.
Ryokei Mifune, who goes by Uni, is a little more than two weeks into a journey of more than 2,000 miles on a nonmotorized child’s scooter, which he estimates may take six months. He is cutting across from Melbourne to Sydney and then following the coast to Cairns, from the mainland’s southernmost airport to the east coast’s northernmost one.
A striking figure on dusty secondary routes, Uni, 23, has surprised more than a few drivers: a slight Japanese man in a traditional “kasa” straw hat and flimsy sandals, with an inexpensive guitar strapped to his back, pushing along on his scooter.
The experience has already been grueling. Sweat pours down his face, the sun scorches his skin, and the rough ground has shredded his feet. Almost everything has been harder than anticipated.
That might be why, as far as he knows, he is the only person to have attempted anything comparable. “I like that no one has done it; I thought it would be a good challenge,” said Uni, whose nickname from childhood means “sea urchin.” He added, “If I were copying something someone else had already accomplished, it wouldn’t be any fun.”
In Japan, Uni trained as a carpenter, then worked a series of odd jobs, including at a gambling parlor and in a pet shop. His passion, other than for adventure, is making short videos, which he posts to social media to chronicle his progress.
A few days into his journey, those updates, often mentioning encounters with welcoming Australians, began to go viral. To Uni’s surprise, local news stories followed, catching the attention of people eager to open their homes — and hearts — to him.
On Tuesday, Leigh Swansborough, 51, and her friend Joy Law, 75, combed the back route from Wagga Wagga, where they live, to Cootamundra, Uni’s next destination, hoping to catch sight of him.
They thought they had failed, Law said, until they turned back toward Wagga Wagga. “There was a big red motorbike parked at the door of the service station shop,” she said. “I just flicked my eyes to the right, and there’s this tiny, little, insignificant, looks-like-it’s-owned-by-a-5-year-old-child scooter.”
Swansborough, a lifelong adventurer, had recently returned after 10 months in Iran, where she had crossed the country on foot, astounded by the generosity of those she met. Here was a chance to pay that forward, she said: “He’s put himself in a situation where he doesn’t know anyone, but he’s putting his trust and faith in Australia.”
Learning that Uni intended to spend the night camping in a public park in an area known for crime, Law insisted on paying for a hotel room for him in the next town, then sent him on his way.
Uni’s journey might be politely described as under-researched.
“I don’t think I prepared anything in particular for this trip,” he said, laughing. “If I think too much, it’ll just complicate things, and it’ll be hard to take a step forward, so I thought, ‘If I jump straight in with no Plan B, I’ll somehow figure things out.’”
In 2021, over 10 months, he completed a similar, less ambitious journey, visiting all 47 prefectures in Japan over the course of 10 months on a similar scooter. “I had zero yen in my pockets when I left, but I sold handmade friendship bracelets for 100 yen each,” he said. “But this is Australia, a bigger journey, so I do have my debit card with me.”
He speaks little English, and his destination was chosen virtually at random. “I didn’t care about what country I wanted to go to; I just wanted to get out of Japan to somewhere I hadn’t been.” On Google Maps, Australia looked large, he recalled. “So I thought it might be an adventure.”
That gung-ho mentality — and a lackadaisical charm — have been crucial on an odyssey that, almost since arrival, has been bumpy.
Even finding a way to leave Melbourne Airport, ringed by highways, on his scooter was challenging, he said. Camping in a public park in Melbourne, he was startled awake by an automatic sprinkler system he mistook for a wild animal. He has been surprised by Australia’s vast network of freeways, which have often sent him onto the country’s gravel back roads, to the detriment of his ride’s flimsy wheels.
His scooter, made for a child and costing around $100, was chosen mostly for its pleasing teal color. (He carries 12 spare ball bearings in case repairs are needed.) Before strangers started to buy him meals, he intended to survive mostly on white bread, occasionally supplementing it with peanut butter when, as he put it, “my taste buds were getting a little lonely.”
And his insubstantial footwear, which he had hoped would let his feet breathe, has already led to the loss of a toenail.
“When I walk on the road, I can feel the rocks,” he said. “My skin is peeling so much, my feet hurt so badly.”
But he soldiers on, bolstered by the kindness of the people he meets.
“I think by being in the newspapers, less people see me as suspicious, which I appreciate,” he said. “On the highway today, I scooted past two police cars, but no one said a word, and when I passed an ambulance, they clapped out the window and even cheered me on by turning on their siren for a second.”
In comments on Uni’s Instagram posts, people often offer him a place to sleep or urge him to get in touch when he reaches their town. He has already spent a few nights at the homes of hospitable strangers.
“He’s this little, tiny person with this big smile and a great sense of humor,” Law said. “The police in Melbourne asked him if he had a helmet, and he said yes, a Japanese one. And he meant his straw hat.” She added, “He gives me hope for the future.”
“Everyone in Australia is rooting for him,” Swansborough said. “He’s living his dream, and he’ll make it — by the seat of his pants.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Hayley Williams Is Fueled by Teas, Thrifting and Terrifying Films

Hayley Williams is only 34, but she is already two decades into her career as the dynamic frontwoman for the pop-punk band Paramore. “I was just saying to the guys, we’re too young to be old, but too old to be young,” she said with a laugh last month, referring to her bandmates, guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro. “There’s people that think of us the way I think of artists that have been doing this way longer than us. Part of me feels 85, and the other part feels like I have no answers to life.”
Aside from the fiery hues of her signature hair, Williams is a very different person from the teenager who formed Paramore in 2004. She has survived a painful divorce, the acrimonious exits of several band members (including Farro, who quit in 2010 but returned in 2017), and delved into deeply personal material on two solo albums released in 2020 and 2021.
Likewise, Paramore’s sixth album, “This Is Why” (out Friday), bears little resemblance to the howling emo of its youth, reveling in the spiky new wave and funkier syncopations of its 2017 LP “After Laughter,” all topped by Williams’ lush, versatile voice. The group’s latest single, the hyper “C’est Comme Ça,” nods to its maturity: “I hate to admit getting better is boring/But the high cost of chaos?/Who can afford it?”
“We’re much better friends to each other,” Williams said. “I remember calling my manager two Christmases ago and being like, ‘I didn’t get you a gift other than to say that we finally figured out how to talk through our problems.’”
As she prepared for “This Is Why,” Paramore’s first album in six years, Williams credited her first solo album, “Petals for Armor,” with building confidence in her own musical prowess. It also empowered her to look outward as she grappled with the trauma of the pandemic and processed racial injustice near her Nashville, Tennessee, home during lockdown. “Mostly, the lyrics are a disdain for resistance to progress,” she said. “We went through all this, and people are still absolute (expletive) to each other.”
From Farro’s rental studio in Nashville, where Williams’ goldendoodle, Alf, hunted for crumbs, the singer and songwriter shared what has inspired and comforted her as her band revved up once again. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
1. Mushrooms: I feel like something happened when (the film) “Fantastic Fungi” came out. It opened up a lot of people’s minds to all the ways mushrooms can be used. (Chef and writer) Sophia Roe has this amazing Instagram account and a new show called “Counter Space,” and she uses mushrooms a lot for plant-based cooking. Mentally, too, the effects that they can have on someone — I’m not speaking from experience here, but I’m very excited to do a guided session and see how it affects my journey with depression and PTSD. And “The Last of Us” is blowing my mind; I love that mushrooms have become such a thing that now the zombies on a TV show have mushroom faces. Taylor and I were watching it the other night, and I was like, I’m the first person to turn. I take this coffee alternative called Everyday Dose, and it has all these cordyceps. I’m definitely a goner.
2. Starface Pimple Stickers: When I would break out in my early 20s, I was petrified for any show or photo shoot. We opened up for No Doubt, and I remember trying to ask Gwen Stefani, like, “Did you ever have acne?” She was like, “Oh, I think I struggled when we toured in the van.” I wasn’t a big makeup-wearer so I didn’t know what to do. I love that there’s this new generation of skin care that’s like: Celebrate it. Decorate your face. Connect the dots.
3. Jonah Hill’s “Stutz”: We watched this documentary in the front lounge of our bus on this last run, which was our first tour in a very long time. I was having anxiety around not being home. It was so meaningful. I love that Jonah Hill is a very well-respected actor, a great filmmaker and he’s like: I’m going to take care of myself before I worry about being a product. That’s why we took four years off. We’ve never gotten to experience the world through any other filter than Paramore, and that’s privilege. People might say, “Yeah, well, you already had success.” But it’s very hard to walk away from opportunities. I’ve done some pretty intense therapy.
4. A24 Horror Films: I grew up with my grandfather taking me to Blockbuster. We would rent “Pet Sematary” or whatever, and we would run around the woods behind his apartment and search for ghosts. What I love most is when the genre takes on social issues, like “The Babadook” or Jordan Peele movies. And Ari Aster’s films for A24 are some of my favorites: “Hereditary,” obviously, and “Midsommar.” A24 feels so artistic. I was even into “Lamb.”
5. Rozi Plain’s “Prize”: Basically, this is the first record that I’ve had on repeat since SZA’s album came out last year. Taylor introduced me to her music. It’s got such warmth to it. I listened to all of Jessica Pratt’s records throughout the pandemic, which was so comforting, and Rozi Plain feels like that.
6. Pique Tea: I love herbal tea. My favorite is rooibos. I attended a Moroccan tea ceremony right before the pandemic hit, and I wanted to learn more about what tea means in different cultures. So I ordered a few things from Tea Huntress here in Nashville. But Pique Tea is great. There’s all this science and ritualization that goes into it that I found really helpful.
7. DYEposit: I’m a little horrified because it’s a product that my hair dye company, Good Dye Young, released last year, but I genuinely use this once a week. (Actress) Jane Asher was the poster on the walls of my mind as we were planning looks for this tour — a little bit strawberry blonde. I use copper DYEposit, and it keeps me from having to re-dye my hair all the time.
8. Alexis Smart Flower Remedies: It’s kind of like Bach Rescue Remedy. You can go on her website and pick these tinctures based on where you’re at, not where you want to be. I purchased a few for social anxiety, as we’re getting ready to be around people again, and for any time I feel impostor syndrome. I wish I’d known about this for “Petals for Armor” because I would have been like, “Yo, can we make a blend?”
9. Pre-Owned Clothes: Growing up, the guys and I shopped at thrift stores almost exclusively. In high school, everyone wanted to look like, I don’t know, Phantom Planet. I didn’t have money, and it was cool. Now it’s for the planet. I hate buying something without any thought and then getting rid of it two months later. I collect vintage T-shirts. I made a decision that when I buy for my personal closet, I will go to Depop or B.Real. It’s a way into sustainability for people that really love fashion.
10. “Play Time”: Solange just composed this beautiful music for a ballet called “Play Time” that was choreographed by Gianna Reisen. I’m going to take my mom to New York in May before we get busy on the U.S. tour. My mom was a ballerina and was injured early on. Later, she worked for the National Dance Institute under Jacques d’Amboise. My 10,000 hours has obviously gone in a different direction, but ballet resonates so much with me.

Full text: And everything else you need to know to hold forth on fashion month at a cocktail party.
Get ready. Your feeds are about to be crammed full of color, sparkle, celebrities and opinion. Fashion month is upon us: hundreds of shows in four cities vying not just for your wardrobes, but for your eyeballs and even sense of outrage.
Who will be bidding for Oscar red carpet glory? Can anyone top the Schiaparelli lion head? Will there be any scandals and controversies? Here's what you need to know
It's make or break time for Balenciaga.
That might seem like hyperbole, but it is not. This is the single most fraught show of the season. Maybe of any season. As you may recall, Balenciaga -- regularly called the hottest brand of the last five years in any fashion ranking thanks to the ability of Demna, its designer, to hold a finger up to the cultural winds and capture them in clothes and context -- had a spectacular fall from grace last fall.
It started in October when Ye, or the artist formerly known as Kanye West, opened the Balenciaga "mud" show, only to follow up with his own Yeezy show to which he wore a White Lives Matter T-shirt, which presaged a host of antisemitic and anti-Black comments. Slow to distance themselves from the rapper, Balenciaga then went live with a holiday ad campaign featuring teddy bear handbags in B.D.S.M. gear held by children, followed by another campaign that contained papers related to a U.S. Supreme Court child pornography case tucked in a pile.
A public outcry ensued, with Balenciaga accused of promoting pedophilia, boycotted and otherwise canceled. Apologies, when they finally came (after an attempt to blame a set design team), were halfhearted. Assumptions were that heads would have to roll, but both Demna and Cédric Charbit, the chief executive, remained in place. Holiday sales, especially in the United States market, have, by all accounts, been dismal. And the Lyst shopping platform reported that in the last quarter of 2022, Balenciaga fell out of its ranking of the top 10 most searched brands for the first time since the index was created in 2018.
Save for the apologies, Balenciaga has remained almost entirely silent, though on Feb. 8 it announced a three-year partnership with the National Children's Alliance, focusing on training and raising awareness of child abuse and protection. The show will be its next major visible statement.
Will Demna use the platform to address the problems? Will he offer some sort of dramatic mea culpa? Can Balenciaga rewrite the narrative and make its products desirable again? Will anyone even go to the show, given the general antipathy for the brand and fears of a backlash against being seen to support it? Will there be protests?
It's all riding on this show, scheduled ton March 5 in Paris.
Burberry is trying to bring back Cool Britannia.
Burberry, the biggest luxury brand in Britain and a sort of doppelgänger for the country, lost its way in recent years under the designer Riccardo Tisci and the chief executive Marco Gobbetti, offering up an outsider-goth version of Britishness that included deer ear prosthetics, backless trench coats and a video inspired by a "love affair between a mermaid and a shark" that included white-clad acolytes swaying in a forest.
But after almost a complete shift at the top, two Brits -- Daniel Lee, the new designer, and Jonathan Akeroyd, the chief executive -- are now in charge, tasked with re-centering the heritage at the heart of the house. Change has already begun, with a new logo that is a throwback to the original Burberry Prorsum horse and rider minted in 1901, plus a teaser ad campaign starring Vanessa Redgrave, Liberty Ross, Skepta and Lennon Gallagher. Yes, the son of Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit, the original Cool Britannia couple of 1997. As clues to where this is going, it's pretty clear.
Obscuring the picture, however, is Mr. Lee himself, who left his previous position as the wunderkind creative director who revamped Bottega Veneta in late 2021 under a cloud of rumors about bad behavior and staff turnover. Mr. Lee has not addressed the issues, nor made any statement about what he has been doing since (other than traveling), a glaring omission in a time of increasing corporate consciousness-raising and value-signaling.
All of which means that while the show is about rehabbing Burberry, it's also about Mr. Lee rehabbing his reputation. Not to mention rehabbing the image of Britain, which, with Brexit, Boris and inflation, could use a win.
Generational change is happening in New York.
There has been a lot of moaning about New York Fashion Week losing its superstars, after Calvin Klein closed its runway line and Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren decided to make their own schedules. But in their absence a rare thing is happening: generational change.
The new guard may not be household names, but they are rethinking what American sportswear means and who gets to define it, in a way that has the potential to reshape fashion for the next decade or more, and to make New York another rare thing: a genuinely diverse design hub.
Thom Browne is taking over from Tom Ford as head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. The two most thrilling showmen in the city, Mr. Browne and Willy Chavarria, lead with theater and emotion, not commerce and calculation. Also look for Heron Preston, bringing his form of "instant language," upcycling and archetypes, back from Paris; Raul Lopez of Luar, who imbues his edgy, gender-agnostic lux with his own back story; Everard Best of Who Decides War, the designer turning jeans into couture; and Taofeek Abijako of Head of State, whose post-colonial storytelling pairs every product he makes with a community-improvement project, both at home (upstate New York) and in Nigeria (where his parents are from) and who dressed Danai Gurira and Evan Mock for last year's Met Gala.
For these designers, fashion isn't just business or art; it's nakedly personal. Sometimes literally naked. They are each building their own communities, reflecting the changing demographics of an evolving world. If they can make it past the start-up phase, they will be the new fashion establishment of the city.
And Harry Styles's favorite designer is debuting in Paris.
Harris Reed, 26, the half-American, half-British, much feted but largely unproven name who made the ball gown Harry Styles wore in Vogue in 2020, and the polka-dot Seussical suit Shania Twain wore to the Grammys on Feb. 5, is the new designer at Nina Ricci, a brand that has been struggling to define itself beyond its perfume pretty much since it tried to move beyond perfume. Mr. Reed's dramatic gender-bending one-offs garner a lot of attention and celebrity kudos when he shows under his own name in London, but they do not exactly scream "commercially viable!" so there's a lot riding on his debut.
It's a similar story with Ludovic de Saint Sernin, 27, the new designer at Ann Demeulemeester, whose genderless shredded peekaboo aesthetic has found fans in Kim Kardashian, Dua Lipa and Rihanna. The Belgian brand, once the epitome of slouchy, existential hipness, has lost some of its mojo in recent years, existing on the good will of its former self. Mr. Saint Sernin's job is to change that trajectory.
The question, in both cases, will be how the designers translate their drama into wearability -- or whether, in the Instagram-TikTok age, statement-making is actually the ultimate goal.

Get ready. Your feeds are about to be crammed full of color, sparkle, celebrities and opinion. Fashion month is upon us: hundreds of shows in four cities vying not just for your wardrobes, but for your eyeballs and even sense of outrage.
Who will be bidding for Oscar red carpet glory? Can anyone top the Schiaparelli lion head? Will there be any scandals and controversies? Here’s what you need to know
It’s make or break time for Balenciaga.
That might seem like hyperbole, but it is not. This is the single most fraught show of the season. Maybe of any season. As you may recall, Balenciaga — regularly called the hottest brand of the last five years in any fashion ranking thanks to the ability of Demna, its designer, to hold a finger up to the cultural winds and capture them in clothes and context — had a spectacular fall from grace last fall.
It started in October when Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, opened the Balenciaga “mud” show, only to follow up with his own Yeezy show to which he wore a White Lives Matter T-shirt, which presaged a host of antisemitic and anti-Black comments. Slow to distance themselves from the rapper, Balenciaga then went live with a holiday ad campaign featuring teddy bear handbags in BDSM gear held by children, followed by another campaign that contained papers related to a U.S. Supreme Court child pornography case tucked in a pile.
A public outcry ensued, with Balenciaga accused of promoting pedophilia, boycotted and otherwise canceled. Apologies, when they finally came (after an attempt to blame a set design team), were halfhearted. Assumptions were that heads would have to roll, but both Demna and Cédric Charbit, the CEO, remained in place. Holiday sales, especially in the United States market, have, by all accounts, been dismal. And the Lyst shopping platform reported that in the last quarter of 2022, Balenciaga fell out of its ranking of the top 10 most searched brands for the first time since the index was created in 2018.
Save for the apologies, Balenciaga has remained almost entirely silent, though on Feb. 8 it announced a three-year partnership with the National Children’s Alliance, focusing on training and raising awareness of child abuse and protection. The show will be its next major visible statement.
Will Demna use the platform to address the problems? Will he offer some sort of dramatic mea culpa? Can Balenciaga rewrite the narrative and make its products desirable again? Will anyone even go to the show, given the general antipathy for the brand and fears of a backlash against being seen to support it? Will there be protests?
It’s all riding on this show, scheduled on March 5 in Paris.
Burberry is trying to bring back Cool Britannia.
Burberry, the biggest luxury brand in Britain and a sort of doppelgänger for the country, lost its way in recent years under designer Riccardo Tisci and CEO Marco Gobbetti, offering up an outsider-goth version of Britishness that included deer ear prosthetics, backless trench coats and a video inspired by a “love affair between a mermaid and a shark” that included white-clad acolytes swaying in a forest.
But after almost a complete shift at the top, two Brits — Daniel Lee, the new designer, and Jonathan Akeroyd, the CEO — are now in charge, tasked with re-centering the heritage at the heart of the house. Change has already begun, with a new logo that is a throwback to the original Burberry Prorsum horse and rider minted in 1901, plus a teaser ad campaign starring Vanessa Redgrave, Liberty Ross, Skepta and Lennon Gallagher. Yes, the son of Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit, the original Cool Britannia couple of 1997. As clues to where this is going, it’s pretty clear.
Obscuring the picture, however, is Lee himself, who left his previous position as the wunderkind creative director who revamped Bottega Veneta in late 2021 under a cloud of rumors about bad behavior and staff turnover. Lee has not addressed the issues, nor made any statement about what he has been doing since (other than traveling), a glaring omission in a time of increasing corporate consciousness-raising and value-signaling.
All of which means that while the show is about rehabbing Burberry, it’s also about Lee rehabbing his reputation. Not to mention rehabbing the image of Britain, which, with Brexit, Boris and inflation, could use a win.
Generational change is happening in New York.
There has been a lot of moaning about New York Fashion Week losing its superstars, after Calvin Klein closed its runway line and Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren decided to make their own schedules. But in their absence a rare thing is happening: generational change.
The new guard may not be household names, but they are rethinking what American sportswear means and who gets to define it, in a way that has the potential to reshape fashion for the next decade or more, and to make New York another rare thing: a genuinely diverse design hub.
Thom Browne is taking over from Tom Ford as head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. The two most thrilling showmen in the city, Browne and Willy Chavarria, lead with theater and emotion, not commerce and calculation. Also look for Heron Preston, bringing his form of “instant language,” upcycling and archetypes, back from Paris; Raul Lopez of Luar, who imbues his edgy, gender-agnostic lux with his own back story; Everard Best of Who Decides War, the designer turning jeans into couture; and Taofeek Abijako of Head of State, whose post-colonial storytelling pairs every product he makes with a community-improvement project, both at home (upstate New York) and in Nigeria (where his parents are from) and who dressed Danai Gurira and Evan Mock for last year’s Met Gala.
For these designers, fashion isn’t just business or art; it’s nakedly personal. Sometimes literally naked. They are each building their own communities, reflecting the changing demographics of an evolving world. If they can make it past the startup phase, they will be the new fashion establishment of the city.
And Harry Styles’ favorite designer is debuting in Paris.
Harris Reed, 26, the half-American, half-British, much feted but largely unproven name who made the ballgown Harry Styles wore in Vogue in 2020, and the polka-dot Seussical suit Shania Twain wore to the Grammys on Sunday, is the new designer at Nina Ricci, a brand that has been struggling to define itself beyond its perfume pretty much since it tried to move beyond perfume. Reed’s dramatic gender-bending one-offs garner a lot of attention and celebrity kudos when he shows under his own name in London, but they do not exactly scream “commercially viable!” so there’s a lot riding on his debut.
It’s a similar story with Ludovic de Saint Sernin, 27, the new designer at Ann Demeulemeester, whose genderless shredded peekaboo aesthetic has found fans in Kim Kardashian, Dua Lipa and Rihanna. The Belgian brand, once the epitome of slouchy, existential hipness, has lost some of its mojo in recent years, existing on the good will of its former self. Saint Sernin’s job is to change that trajectory.
The question, in both cases, will be how the designers translate their drama into wearability — or whether, in the Instagram-TikTok age, statement-making is actually the ultimate goal. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Irving Speaks, and He Says It's All the Nets' Fault: [Sports Desk]

Full text: After his first practice with the Dallas Mavericks since being traded from the Nets, Kyrie Irving said he felt nothing but "genuine love" from his new team.
After practicing with the Dallas Mavericks for the first time, Kyrie Irving sat in front of a team-themed backdrop on Tuesday afternoon to express his excitement and criticize his former employer.
"I want to be in a place where I'm celebrated and not just tolerated or just kind of dealt with in a way that doesn't make me feel respected," Irving said in his first public remarks since the Nets fulfilled his trade request and agreed to send him to the Mavericks on Sunday. "And there were times throughout this process when I was in Brooklyn where I felt very disrespected."
Irving, 30, whose tumultuous three and a half seasons with the Nets were marred by absences, distractions and controversy, spoke with reporters after meeting his new teammates at the University of Southern California. Irving, an eight-time N.B.A. All-Star who is expected to make his Mavericks debut on Wednesday against the Los Angeles Clippers, said he felt nothing but "genuine love" since joining the team.
He added that he looked forward to "being one of the leaders on our team, alongside the coaches and the front office, of just exemplifying what greatness looks like." He also complained that "no one ever talks about my work ethic." In Dallas, he said, "I just want to change that narrative and write my own stories."
And so it went for Irving, one of the N.B.A.'s most polarizing stars -- a dynamic point guard with a history of social activism, but one who has also spent recent seasons trafficking in conspiracy theories. On Tuesday, he made it clear that he blamed the Nets' front office for nearly everything that had gone wrong.
"The greatest lesson I could share with you that I learned from signing in Brooklyn for free agency is, I wish I would've gotten to know the people that were behind the organization," Irving said.
Last season, Irving appeared in just 29 of the team's 82 regular-season games because he would not get vaccinated against the coronavirus despite New York City's vaccine requirement for private sector employees. This season, he missed eight games after the Nets suspended him for refusing to apologize for posting a link to an antisemitic film on his social media accounts.
Irving later posted an apology on Instagram, but he has since deleted it. On Tuesday, Irving said that he often deletes his old social media posts. He was asked whether he stood by his apology.
"I stand by who I am and why I apologized," he said, "and I did it because I care about my family and I have Jewish members of my family that care for me deeply."
Basketball often seems like a secondary topic whenever Irving is involved, but the Mavericks are now Point Guard Central -- an experiment they hope will lift them out of mediocrity and into the championship chase. Irving will be playing alongside Luka Doncic, who, at 23, is already one of the league's brightest stars. Like Irving, Doncic enjoys creating with the ball in his hands. The job of getting them to produce together will fall on Jason Kidd, the team's coach and a Hall of Fame point guard who knows the position.
"Those two are going to work and get their relationship and get their rhythm," Kidd said. "It's going to take a little time, but I don't think it will take as long as others will think."
Kidd added: "This isn't two 23-year-olds trying to see who's the alpha. We understand this is Luka's team. And it will be Luka's team."
Irving's departure from Brooklyn brought an end to a once-promising partnership with Kevin Durant. Irving reminisced about joining the Nets with Durant in free agency before the 2019-20 season, saying they saw themselves as "savants in the culture that we wanted to teach the young'uns." The dream, Irving said, was to win a championship.
With Irving and Durant, the Nets won exactly one playoff series and were swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round last season. Durant has not spoken publicly since the trade.
"I mean, obviously he wished things could've gone different," Irving said, adding: "It just didn't work out. We still remain brothers."
Durant has missed the Nets' last 13 games with a knee injury.
Irving, who is in the final year of his contract, had been hoping to work out an extension to remain in Brooklyn. But on Jan. 25, Shetellia Riley Irving, his agent and stepmother, told Bleacher Report that those negotiations were not progressing. His trade request was made public last week.
"I wish them well," Irving said. "Left them in fourth place. Did what I was supposed to do. Took care of my teammates."

Full text: Eating outdoors in the winter? No problem.
I'd like to start this week's newsletter with a very heartfelt thank you to the folks here at The Times who contributed to last week's Valentine's Day dining newsletter. They are some of the busiest people on staff, and I appreciate their taking the time to share such thoughtful recommendations. We will definitely do that again!
Today, it's reader question time: This month, we have visitors wondering where they should dine in Dumbo, Brooklyn; someone looking for regional Italian specialties; and a request for outdoor dining spots in Lower Manhattan. As always, if you have questions or want to offer some polite commentary, email me at wheretoeat@nytimes.com.
Old-School Sicilian on the Waterfront
My friends and I really enjoy Sicilian and Italian specialties that include sarde, bottarga, merluzzo, and interesting pastas with unusual non-red-meat ingredients. Restaurants that focus on this seem far and few between. Any recommendations? -- Marc T.
I hope you don't mind, but let's focus on the Sicilian part of your request. I'm going to point you in the direction of the 119-year-old Ferdinando's Focacceria, in the Columbia Street Waterfront District in Brooklyn. It's a homey setup with hexagonal tiled floors, grandma plates and one wall covered with images of famous people who have stopped by -- Christopher Meloni, Martin Scorsese and at least two New York City mayors. Order the softball-size arancini special, covered in red sauce and some of the freshest ricotta I've had in recent memory, and then get that pasta con le sarde you've been craving. It's at turns sweet (thanks to golden raisins) and wonderfully funky (the sardines), with bucatini cooked al dente, of course.
Dining in Dumbo
My husband and I will be staying in the Dumbo area in mid-March to see a concert. We have two days and nights and would love some recommendations for dinner. We like eclectic restaurants and would love to be able to walk rather than Uber or taxi. -- Maureen P.
Dumbo doesn't enter the restaurant conversation enough, which is a shame because there are some nice options! I simply must give a shout-out to the ever-reliable Superfine, on Front Street, where I enjoyed several happy hours as a fresh-off-the-U-Haul-truck 20-something. It's unfussy, with a wide-ranging menu, and if you go on a Wednesday night there's live jazz. For some of the finest coal oven-fired pizza in the city, check out Juliana's. And you know who's still got it after 15 years? Vinegar Hill House, on the edge of the neighborhood. I recently had a lovely lamb ragù there, as well as chicken-liver mousse with crusty bread and piquant mustard. And the real victory? I was able to get a reservation with less than 24 hours' notice.
Winter-Proof Outdoor Dining
Any recommendations in Lower Manhattan with heated outdoor patios for a business lunch? My team meets monthly for lunch as we're still working from home, and one of my colleagues feels uncomfortable eating indoors after the pandemic. -- Hannah M.
I will be tackling dining for the Covid-conscious in the very near future, but for now I have two recommendations. Many restaurants seem to have opted out of winter-proofing their outdoor dining areas, but Fairfax, in the West Village, still has its "yurts," with hefty overhead heaters to keep you and your party warm in isolation with your burgers and Old Bay tots. And the team will love you forever if you treat them to Uncle Boon's khao pat puu (crab fried rice) and red curry rice salad under the heaters at Thai Diner, on Mott Street. That's just science.
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviewed Le Bernardin for the first time since 2012, and he found that the restaurant has come out stronger on the other side of a pandemic that devastated the industry.
Openings: Moody Tongue Sushi, the two Michelin star brewery and restaurant from Chicago, will open on West 10th Street on Friday; Goa New York, from the Toronto restaurateur Hemant Bhagwani, will take over the space that once housed Tetsu; and the chef Greg Baxtrom's Maison Yaki, in Prospect Heights, has turned into his new spot, Petite Patate, a French bistro.
The HBO Max show "The Last of Us" has inspired a wave of fungi-based fear. But, Tejal Rao writes, much of that fear comes from the mystical and mysterious role they play in nature.
It wouldn't be the Roaring 2020s without the return of the Bee's Knees cocktail, Robert Simonson reported.
The reporter Brittany Loggins wrote about One if by Land, Two if by Sea, the Greenwich Village restaurant with a romantic setting that sees as many as 10 proposals per week in February.

The Life-Changing Magic of a Urologist: [Science Desk]

Author: Dunn, Jancee

Publication info: Dunn, Jancee.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Here are three issues you may want to address with a professional.
Urologists often deal with health problems that arise from two very intimate functions: peeing and sex. Because of this, "most urologists tend to have a lot of brevity and a bit of humor, because we know these are hard topics for our patients," said Maria Uloko, a urologist at UC San Diego Health and assistant professor of urology at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.
In my experience (as both a patient and a health journalist), urologists will happily discuss the subjects that some of us laypeople tend to avoid: erectile problems, peeing too much, peeing too little, painful sex, dwindling or nonexistent orgasms, urinary tract infections and the list goes on.
Rachel Rubin, a urologist and sexual health specialist based outside Washington, D.C., said many people don't share these issues with their doctor even if they are ongoing; they simply learn to live with discomfort. "They'll tell themselves, 'Well, that's just aging. Suck it up,"' Dr. Rubin said. But, "if it bothers you and it matters to you, then it's a medical problem with medical solutions."
There are two parts of a urologist's job. "There's the serious illness stuff, like cancers," said Nelson Bennett, a professor of urology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who specializes in male sexual function. "But there's a big chunk of our practice that is basically quality of life. I tell my patients that no one dies of not having an erection, but they're still suffering." All of this may be why people who have seen a urologist (present company included) sometimes say the results are life altering.
Here are three issues you may want to address with a professional.
Erection problems
If you have erectile dysfunction, Dr. Rubin said: "Don't be embarrassed. So do your friends." Erectile dysfunction affects as many as 30 million men in the United States, according to the American Urological Association.
There are treatment options for almost every erectile problem, including oral medications, injectable medications, surgery and cognitive behavioral therapy, Dr. Bennett said.
Although it can be tempting to furtively order medications such as Viagra on direct-to-consumer websites, a practice that Dr. Bennett found, in a 2021 study, is dramatically increasing, he said there are several reasons to see a specialist instead. "We can actually begin to figure out why you're having the problem, as opposed to just taking medication to cover it up," he said. Some medications can also affect erections, such as antidepressants, which can cause orgasms to be delayed, or vanish altogether. And a urologist can screen for those, he said.
What's more, erection problems can be a sign of heart problems down the road. Penis arteries, which are one millimeter in diameter, are very small, compared with heart arteries, which are 3 millimeters. "So if you're clogging your small pipes first, you may have erectile dysfunction before you have your first heart attack," Dr. Rubin said.
"Those are the guys you need to start looking at," said Dr. Bennett, "because we know that erectile issues will predate cardiovascular issues by about 10 years."
Painful sex
For older women, painful sex is a leading sign of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, or G.S.M., a term that in 2014 replaced the dispiriting phrase "vulvovaginal atrophy." During perimenopause and beyond, as estrogen leaves a woman's body, the tissues in the vulva, vagina and urinary tract become dryer, less supple and more sensitive. This process can cause recurrent urinary tract infections and incontinence, and sex can become excruciating, which takes many women by surprise, Dr. Rubin said. G.S.M. may affect up to half of postmenopausal women, according to a 2019 review, and is "unlikely to improve without treatment."
What has been shown to work for conditions like G.S.M., Dr. Rubin said, are treatments like inserts with DHEA, a steroid that mimics hormones, lubricants and moisturizers; ospemifene, an oral medication that is approved by the Federal Drug Administration to treat G.S.M.; vaginal dilators; and low-dose topical vaginal estrogen.
"There's not a cocktail party or children's birthday party where I don't recommend vaginal hormones," Dr. Rubin said. (It is important, however, that you discuss any of these treatments with your own doctor first.)
Pelvic floor therapy is another option, Dr. Rubin added. "Pelvic floor therapists rehab your muscles, just like you would do rehab after a knee replacement." And you don't have to do it forever, she added. "Physical therapists are there to optimize your pelvis and send you out the door."
Then there's the D.I.Y. approach: a 2023 review found that vibrators were considered "an accepted modality" to treat vulvar pain. "I think doctors should be prescribing vibrators, which are health aids, just like eyeglasses or hearing aids," Dr. Rubin added. "The more we normalize them and educate patients in exam rooms about them, the better."
Bladder issues
You may know that bladder control loss afflicts women at various hormonal stages in their lives -- pregnancy, after giving birth and during menopause -- but "men are plagued by urinary incontinence, too," Dr. Bennett said. A quarter to a third of Americans have incontinence, according to the American Urological Association.
There are two main types: "stress incontinence," which means sudden leaking brought on by activities like coughing, sneezing or exercise, and "urgency incontinence," a strong and immediate urge to pee, which sends you on a mad dash to the bathroom.
Some male patients will visit the bathroom 10 times a night because of a prostate issue, which leads to sleep deprivation, Dr. Bennett said.
Some treatments for urinary incontinence include medication, and for women, vaginal estrogen, but urologists also teach patients Kegel exercises, use electrical stimulation and employ pelvic floor physical therapy. (Men have a pelvic floor, too.)
Urologists, Dr. Uloko said, "are really glorified plumbers. We know how to fix the leaks."
Test your cooking oil knowledge with our quiz.
Many of us have a pantry full of oils -- but how much do you actually know about them? Some oils are not as healthy as you may think, while others get an unfairly bad rap. Hannah Seo reports on which contain saturated fat, which raise our HDL, or "good" cholesterol, and which to avoid if you're cooking with high heat.

Colonoscopy first-timer? Don't believe the scary stories.
Colonoscopies are now recommended for most people beginning at age 45. Dr. Trisha Pasricha, a gastroenterologist, writes that they are safer and more comfortable than ever. She shares experts' tips about what you need to do to kick off "the surge before the purge."

St. Andrews Steps Back From Its Plan to Remodel Beloved Old Course Bridge: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Want a patio-like surface by a bridge that's perhaps more than 700 years old? St. Andrews did, but many others most definitely did not.
St. Andrews Links -- the stately sporting refuge in Scotland that has outlasted major champions, monarchs and well-to-do duffers -- caved Monday and abandoned plans for a patio-like surface by the Swilcan Bridge.
Few locales in golf invite quite so many pilgrimages as the stone bridge, which crosses a burn on the Old Course's 18th hole and is the centerpiece of photographs that surface in Scottish pubs, man-caves all over suburban America and Tiger Woods's office in Florida. So, perhaps it was predictable that even some well-intentioned remodeling of the area around it, worn down by the footwear of many thousands of players and visitors, would lead to fury, confusion and more than a few memes.
Golf, you might have heard, is not always keen on change, and the resulting kerfuffle will amount to a brief, if breathtakingly effective, chapter in the very long history -- like, maybe more than 700 years -- of a 30-foot bridge. The whole spat, of course, could have been avoided had the bridge stuck to its long-ago mission of catering to livestock.
But since that did not happen and because many people cannot mimic Arnold Palmer or Jack Nicklaus or Woods on their scorecards, they merely congregate at the bridge, wave like a British Open champion, memorialize the moment for Facebook or Instagram and march on their way, leaving tattered turf behind.
The idea that set off the scorn, course officials said over the weekend, was to replicate a past stone pathway and guard against repeated bouts of "disrepair" after a handful of other strategies, including artificial turf, proved insufficient. They added that they could "categorically state that no works have been undertaken to the bridge itself."
As if that would calm down, say, the denizens of Twitter. By Monday night, the Old Course was seeking another solution, new, old or at least not that one.
"The stonework at the approach and exit of the bridge was identified as one possible long term solution," the course's administrators said in a statement that conceded that "while this installation would have provided some protection, in this instance we believe we are unable to create a look which is in keeping with its iconic setting and have taken the decision to remove it."
The statement noted "feedback from many partners and stakeholders as well as the golfing public," which was a most proper way to characterize social media-fueled disdain and mockery.
"What in the world were those idiots thinking building this?" Hank Haney, who once coached Woods, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Nick Faldo, whose six major tournament titles included the 1990 Open at St. Andrews, was also aghast.
"If you've travelled halfway around the world for your bucket list round at St Andrews, would you rather leave with a bit of historic dirt on your shoes or a few cement mix scraps?" he asked. Perhaps, he mused, the approach was a "strategically placed sundial (for slow play)."
St. Andrews officials said Monday that turf would be restored "in the coming days." Even though the internet never seems to forget, there is plenty of time for recovery between now and the next Open at St. Andrews. This year's tournament will be at Royal Liverpool, the 2024 festivities will be at Royal Troon and 2025 will see the competition return to Royal Portrush.
The R&A, which organizes the Open, has not announced its plans for other years.

For Ironman's Elite, Moving of Kona Race Is a Blow to a Dream: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The iconic one-day world championship event has outgrown the small town on the island of Hawaii. But will triathletes follow the race outside of Kona?
The highest peak of a triathlete's career can be found along a stretch of Ali'i Drive in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.
It's a small road, one dotted with local cafes, a smattering of hotels and the Kona Farmers Market.
Since 1981, the town of around 20,000 has played host to the pinnacle of the sport: the Ironman World Championship. Annually, 2,500 athletes qualify to participate in the event, having outraced those in their age groups in a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile marathon.
"Everyone who has heard of triathlon as a sport has heard of Kona," Todd Wakefield, a world championship qualifier said.
But on Jan. 5, Ironman officially announced that it would be making a long-term change to the annual world championship. The 2023 event will take place across two days in two cities. This year, men will be racing in Nice, France, on Sept. 10, while the women will race in Kona on Oct. 14. The two cities will host until 2026, with men and women switching locations every year.
No longer would Kona be singularly synonymous with the top Ironman triathletes in the world.
"Heartbreaking," Drew Jordan, another world championship qualifier, said. In 2018, Wakefield and Jordan began sharing their triathlon journey and a look at the most prestigious course on an Instagram account called Couch to Kona.
The "two dudes trying to stay fit," as they call themselves, were inundated with messages after the official call came down. Everything was about Kona, they said, one echoing the other between sighs. "We've literally been thinking about trying to qualify for this race for four years now," Jordan said.
It was a major change that many have seen coming for some time, but one that was realized in 2022 in part because of an enormous glut of qualifiers who had yet to race because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Andrew Messick, the chief executive of Ironman.
In an effort to get qualified athletes racing again, the 2021 world championship -- the first held after the 2020 race's cancellation -- was moved to St. George, Utah, a location with looser Covid restrictions.
Qualifiers from 2019 were given an option of either racing in May 2022 in Utah (the event counted as the 2021 championship) or deferring their qualification to the usual time and location of the championships, the second weekend of October in Kona (an event that would count as the 2022 championship).
Most athletes picked the latter, choosing the mystique of Kona over the first championship to return since the onset of the pandemic.
"Everyone's dream is Kona," Skye Ombac, a triathlete from Hawaii, said. A fan of the sport, Ombac streamed the St. George world championship in May 2022. "They still had the Hawaiian drums, and the volunteers had the fake leis. And there were Hawaiian dancers and they were trying so hard to still make it Kona, but it's not in Kona."
"It was a world championship," Ombac continued. "But everyone said it was the world championship in quotation marks; it's not Kona."
After a series of conversations with Mitch Roth, the mayor of Hawaii County, Messick and his team decided to host two days of racing in Kona in 2022, with men and women competing on different days. There were two live broadcasts.
This was the future, Messick thought. Bigger fields, more qualifying slots for age-group athletes and a clear way to highlight the women's race, which has historically been swallowed up by simultaneous coverage of the men's race.
"We need to continue to adapt to what has been an extraordinary growth in demand for the world championship," Messick said. "While Kona is a huge part of the history of Ironman, we have outgrown the ability to do a world championship in just one day there."
Around 2,500 athletes translates to some 10,000 visitors for the coastal town on the west side of the island of Hawaii. For many, it feels like the race subsumes the area. Bicycles that are worth tens of thousands of dollars flood the airport, and popular pre-race foods like bananas become impossible to find on the island. Road closures in the small town make travel nearly impossible.
Permanently increasing the number of participants -- and adding a second race day -- would not have been sustainable in Kona in the long term.
The number of athletes who could qualify for the world championship has not changed, even as the number of athletes competing in the Ironman series of races has exploded in the past 17 years. It has gone from 15,500 registrations for full-distance Ironman triathlon events in 2005 to some 94,000 registrations for full-distance Ironman races in 2022. In 2005, there were 14 full distance Ironman triathlons around the world. In 2023, there are 44 such races scheduled. But the number of athletes who could toe the line in Kona remained squarely around 2,500.
That's in contrast to an event like the Boston Marathon. That race, a pinnacle for amateur distance runners, had a field of close to 20,000 in 2005. It has grown to a field of around 30,000 in 2022.
It is difficult to overstate the significance of place to these races. For runners and triathletes, qualifying for a race is qualifying to "run Boston" or to "race Kona." Runners don't want to qualify for the Boston Marathon to run the marathon in another city. And many aren't interested in qualifying for a world championship to race outside of Hawaii.
Some athletes, including Jordan and Wakefield, are beginning to strategize. They still plan to focus on qualifying for the world championship, but only when it's their turn to race in Kona. Ombac, a teacher who was cheered on by students on race day, said competing in Kona was one of the best days of her life, but traveling to Nice for a championship is too expensive. Some athletes may have on years and off years.
If there's one point everyone can agree on, it's the improved coverage of the women's race that came with a separate event date. Athletes interviewed -- even those who were vehemently opposed to the change -- nodded toward that progress.
It's "good for the sport," Sarah Crowley, a two-time world championship bronze medalist who finished seventh in the 2022 race, said.
"After seeing the success of the two-day format I can see the importance of the women's only race," Crowley, an Australian athlete, said. "Being a female competitor at the highest level, it showcased the women individually and gave us our own day."
As she discussed the change in location, she said she would go anywhere to race in the world championship. A world title is a world title, she said.
But then she paused. It may be a different conversation if she were headed to Nice this year after all.
"It's easy to see it through my eyes because I get to go to Kona this year," she said.

Where Rap Gods Get Their Bling: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The jewelry designer Alex Moss specializes in creating custom pieces for clients like Drake and Jack Harlow. This month, he releases a collection available to the masses.
Nine floors above the storefronts of New York's diamond district, in a corner suite of the World Diamond Tower, a lariat necklace with diamonds the size of molars sat inside a silver briefcase. The necklace was fresh from a cleaning -- an ultrasonic water bath, followed by a steam -- and visiting the office of the jewelry designer Alex Moss in late January en route to its owner: the rapper and singer Drake.
"Jewelry is like a car, it needs to be maintained," Mr. Moss, 30, said.
The piece, created by Mr. Moss, took 14 months to make. A video shared on Instagram by the designer said that its 42 diamonds represented the number of times that Drake had considered proposing marriage. When asked how much the necklace cost, Mr. Moss declined to answer, citing the security of its owner.
Personal orders like Drake's necklace have been Mr. Moss's bread and butter since he started his namesake line in 2020. Last year, he created about 170 custom pieces, he said, and is currently juggling about 40. Much of that jewelry has been made for young hip-hop artists: His other clients have included include Tyler, the Creator, ASAP Rocky and Chief Keef. Some of the pieces have had price tags with six figures, including a belt set with rubies and white, black and green diamonds for ASAP Rocky, and a diamond-and-sapphire-encrusted bellhop chain for Tyler, the Creator.
"The artists I look up to went to the Ben Ballers, to the Jacobs, to the Lorraines," said Tyler, the Creator, referring to the jewelry designers Ben Yang, Jacob Arabo (a.k.a. Jacob the Jeweler) and Lorraine Schwartz, all of whom have been recognized for blinging out hip-hop stars. "Now we have Alex Moss."
'I Can Do This'
This month, Mr. Moss is expanding his business with the introduction of a new collection of ready-made jewelry sold on his website. Starting at about $ 1,000, the pieces are by no means cheap, but they cost less than his custom designs. "There is a huge range," he said.
The collection, called "Cathedral of Dreams," borrows heavily from Christian and gothic imagery. There are pieces shaped like crosses, crucifixes, angels and the face of Jesus wearing a diamond-studded crown of thorns. "I've always loved the aesthetic," said Mr. Moss, who was raised in the Armenian Orthodox Church.
"I'm faithful," added Mr. Moss, who was puffing on a strawberry kiwi vape and wearing three of his line's chain necklaces, as well as a tongue-shaped "Lick of Death" ring from his new collection. "But I am not the most religious person."
Mr. Moss, who is from a suburb of Toronto, said he was obsessed with "Star Wars" and downloading hip-hop music from the Napster successor Kazaa when he was growing up. As a tween, he nurtured his creativity through Adobe Photoshop, which he learned to master himself. Using money he had saved, some made from reselling sneakers on eBay, he started a streetwear line called Bandit in his senior year of high school, before dropping out. A self-described "troublemaker," Mr. Moss then had jobs as a waiter, a paralegal assistant and at a Bed Bath & Beyond store while working on his streetwear line.
In 2016, after earning his high school equivalency diploma in Canada, he moved to New York at 25 to study fashion at Parsons School of Design.
"It wasn't a typical path," said Mr. Moss, who is 6 foot 5 inches and has wavy shoulder-length black hair and a black goatee. "Me being 25 and all of these kids are 18."
While at Parsons, he got an internship at the jeweler Avianne & Co. in Midtown. (Its office is a few doors down from Mr. Moss's suite in the World Diamond Tower.) He developed an interest in jewelry through his love of hip-hop, he said, and as an intern, he would help design custom pieces.
"I was like OK, I'm actually sick. I can do this," Mr. Moss said. Eventually, he dropped out of Parsons to work on custom design projects at Avianne & Co.
He had already worked on some personal orders for hip-hop artists by the time the rapper Playboi Carti introduced him to ASAP Rocky while the men were in Paris for Virgil Abloh's debut men's wear show for Louis Vuitton in 2018. "I thought he was a rapper the first time we met," ASAP Rocky said. Of Mr. Moss's jewelry, he added: "It's less about the flex than the artistic value."
When Mr. Moss started his namesake line in 2020, he was working from his apartment in the Long Island City section of Queens. At the time, he had saved enough money to cover rent and living expenses for a couple of months, he said. Two weeks later, New York implemented its pandemic lockdown.
"Who was going to buy jewelry?" Mr. Moss recalled thinking at the time. "No one even knew where we were getting food from."
Early six-figure custom orders, including from the rapper Jack Harlow and the music producer Rvssian, kept his business afloat, he said, and enabled him to set up shop at his diamond district location.
A Desire to Be Attainable
From Mr. Moss's office overlooking 47th Street, the glimmering red lights of Times Square look a bit like shimmering Burmese rubies. Inside, there are rocks both real (diamonds in jewelry display cases, green marble on walls) and fake (in one nook, walls were treated to look like a cavern, or "diamond cave," as Mr. Moss called it).
In another corner are a Pac-Man arcade game and a vending machine that Mr. Moss hopes to one day fill with branded trinkets. "Key chains, ashtrays, things you can only get here," he said.
His office and showroom are a few floors above the factory where his line's pieces are made, a space that Mr. Moss had previously used as his first office in the World Diamond Tower. ("He's moving on up, like George Jefferson," as ASAP Rocky put it.) The factory is made up of two lab-like rooms where a head jeweler oversees a team of three diamond setters as they place stones and laser precious metals.
Mr. Moss, who employs 15 people, is quick to point out that the artisans in the factory are the "jewelers" who construct his pieces, and that he is the "jewelry designer" who conceives them. "I'm like Ralph Lifshitz," Mr. Moss said, referring to the founder of Ralph Lauren, who built an empire not on sewing expertise, but on creative vision.
In discussing the future of his company, Mr. Moss mentioned aspirations for it to follow the trajectory of Chrome Hearts, which over the years has evolved from a niche line to a lifestyle brand, in part because famous musical artists (Cher) and models (Bella Hadid) have helped popularize its silver jewelry, hoodies and T-shirts.
"Chrome Hearts is attainable," Mr. Moss said. "That is the direction we are going in."
He is working on renderings for a watch he hopes to start producing in partnership with a watchmaker in the coming years. Though Mr. Moss has customized vintage Cartier and Rolex watches -- a process he calls "Frankensteining" -- he has yet to design his own timepieces.
He also wants to open a flagship store and showroom in SoHo. Though his business has flourished in the diamond district, there are associations with the neighborhood that could become limitations to additional growth, Mr. Moss said.
"A lot of jewelers in our space, they are like Chris the Jeweler, Jacob the Jeweler," he said. "I'm not Alex the Jeweler. We are Alex Moss New York."

Court Vacates Tennis Star's Guilty Plea in Assault Case: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The guilty plea and dismissal stemmed from a confrontation Mr. Kyrgios had with his partner in 2021 when she tried to prevent him from leaving in a ride-hailing car.
MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios pleaded guilty on Friday to common assault during a court hearing in Canberra, the Australian capital and his hometown. But shortly after, the court dismissed the charge.
Mr. Kyrgios, 27, faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison for shoving his former romantic partner, but he argued for dismissal of the charge, citing his history of mental health issues. He withdrew that bid after the court heard evidence that he was not suffering a significant depressive illness.
His lawyer then called for the conviction to be dismissed on the grounds that Mr. Kyrgios would face a greater harm from it than an ordinary defendant. The magistrate agreed, effectively dismissing the charge and allowing Mr. Kyrgios to walk away without a conviction or a criminal record.
The seriousness of the matter was "low-level," the magistrate, Beth Campbell, said, adding that she did not think the tennis star was likely to offend again.
The unexpected chain of events in the packed courtroom stemmed from an altercation in January 2021, in which Mr. Kyrgios was accused of having shoved Chiara Passari, his former partner, during a dispute when she tried to prevent him from leaving in an Uber.
The couple briefly split after the alleged incident, then reconciled. Ms. Passari, an Australian model, did not report the matter to the police until they had separated once again, in December 2021.
In a post on Instagram after the hearing, Mr. Kyrgios thanked the court for dismissing the charge, cited mental health difficulties at the time of the incident and thanked his friends, family and new partner, Costeen Hatzi.
"I was not in a good place when this happened, and I reacted to a difficult situation in a way I deeply regret," he said. "I know I wasn't OK, and I'm sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused."
"Mental health is tough," he said, adding: "I now plan to focus on recovering from injury and moving forward in the best way possible."
Common assault, the charge brought against Mr. Kyrgios, is the least serious assault charge in Australia, and indicates that the victim experienced immediate, unlawful violence, or the threat of it, though not bodily injury. Ms. Passari had reported shoulder pain and a grazed knee after the altercation.
Known for his outbursts on and off the court and for his mercurial, magnetic playing style, Mr. Kyrgios has become a kind of folk hero in his native Australia for pushing boundaries with his behavior. On Friday, he had arrived at court on crutches after recently undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.
Last month, he was awaiting a warm welcome on home turf at the Australian Open, the first major tennis tournament of the year. He withdrew a little more than 24 hours before his scheduled first-round match because of a knee injury, which resulted in the surgery.

Full text: After years of expansion and billions in profits, Big Tech is pulling back from its famously lavish spending as a long boom finally ends.
For much of last year, tech companies stumbled. Digital ad sales plunged. E-commerce sputtered. IPhone production stalled. And investors lost faith.
It was the worst year that the tech industry had experienced on Wall Street since the financial crisis of 2008. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta lost a combined $ 3.9 trillion in market value.
Now chastened, many tech companies have begun the year by championing a new and unfamiliar business strategy: austerity.
In recent months, several companies have said they are looking for ways to cut costs and eliminate futuristic projects that have become money pits. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have each announced plans to lay off more than 10,000 workers.
It is an abrupt turn for an industry that became famous for its big salaries, extravagant offices and lavish perks, from free shuttle buses to free laundry services for employees. But as a boom that lasted 15 years comes to an end, shrinking profits are making tech executives rethink what they believed were important tools in an industrywide competition to hoard tech talent.
On Thursday, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google's parent company, said it was "committed to investing responsibly, with great discipline." Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, assured investors that the company would be "thoughtful and deliberate." And Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, made his first appearance on a call with analysts since taking over from Jeff Bezos about 18 months ago and underscored how hard the company had worked to corral what looked like runaway costs.
Their message built on the tone that Mark Zuckerberg set for the industry on Wednesday when he called 2023 "the year of efficiency." During a call with analysts, in which "efficiency" was said more than 30 times, Mr. Zuckerberg talked about spending less on infrastructure, removing layers of management and killing dead-end projects.
Investors are cheering tech's new faith in financial discipline. Shares of Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, jumped more than 23 percent on Thursday, its biggest daily gain in nearly a decade. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple all rallied, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 3 percent.
"People wanted to get back in, and they wanted to figure out when the water is safe to wade into," said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, an investment firm. He added that the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to increase interest rates by a modest quarter-point helped tech companies as well, because it suggested that the central bank was getting inflation under control.
"You don't need much good news for the stocks to outperform," Mr. Mahaney said.
But shares of several of those companies dropped in after-hours trading on Thursday evening after they reported disappointing results for the most recent quarter, making it clear that tech's business challenges remain.
On Thursday, Google reported its second decline in advertising, ever. Amazon said that its lucrative cloud computing business had slowed and that sales in its core e-commerce business had declined. And Apple posted its biggest decline in Christmas season iPhone sales since 2018.
Earlier in the day, Meta reported that its sales in the final three months of last year had fallen 4 percent. Last week, Microsoft said spending on cloud computing was weakening.
The market's reaction to lackluster tech earnings could be an indication of what is to come for the broader economy. Economists are trying to assess whether the economy can avoid a deep recession and achieve what some are calling a soft landing. If tech, as the most prominent industry to weaken last year, finds a bottom and begins to rebound, it would be an illustration of the relative strength of the broader economy, said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist.
"Six months ago, the economy was contracting and interest rates were rising, and there was a rebalance away from the pandemic," Mr. Furman said. "That perfect storm," he added, "isn't true any more."
Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all reported quarterly results that largely fell short of Wall Street expectations on Thursday. Alphabet posted its fourth consecutive decline in profit as it grappled with a slowdown in digital advertising. Advertising sales at YouTube, Google's video platform, dipped nearly 8 percent to $ 7.96 billion, below the $ 8.2 billion expected by analysts.
As Google's sales slow, Mr. Pichai said, the company is making various efforts to tame expenses. They include improving the financial performance of its phones and other gadgets, trying to make its cloud division profitable and strengthening YouTube's business.
"I see this as an important journey to re-engineer the company's cost base in a durable way," Mr. Pichai said.
At Amazon, Mr. Jassy has been pushing to trim costs for the past year. The company has been working through plans to lay off 18,000 corporate and tech workers, it added fees for grocery deliveries that had once been free, and it cut back from a breakneck warehouse expansion that left it with too much space.
Still, Amazon barely eked out a profit, producing just $ 278 million in net income during the December quarter, as sales rose 9 percent from a year earlier to $ 149.2 billion.
During the call with analysts, Mr. Jassy said he had been focused on reducing the costs associated with fulfilling and delivering packages. The company vastly expanded its warehouses and hiring during the pandemic to keep pace with demand. Even after almost a year of pulling back expansion, he said, "there is a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient."
Apple lost an estimated $ 7 billion in iPhone sales during the December quarter when its largest iPhone factory in China was locked down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. The company offset those losses with strong sales of iPads, which increased 30 percent, and services such as subscriptions to Apple Music.
Mr. Cook said macroeconomic factors, including inflation and the war in Ukraine, had contributed to the company's struggles. In the face of those challenges, the company said, it is reining in spending, which will help improve its profit margins.
"We're doing a lot of work around costs," said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer. "That is paying off."
There are still regulatory efforts to curb the industry's power, including a lawsuit that the Department of Justice brought last month against Google, claiming it has abused its position as an advertising technology monopoly. But the impacts of those actions are far in the future.
The tech industry has been relatively effective at holding regulators at bay. On Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the Federal Trade Commission's request to stop Meta from buying a virtual reality start-up. Last year, Washington lobbyists effectively stymied bills in Congress that aimed to open up competition on app stores and prevent tech companies from giving their own products preference on their platforms.
"Some of the pressure has come off because these guys have been hit so hard and had to lay off so many people," said Bob O'Donnell, president of Technalysis Research, a firm specializing in tech research. "There's a realization that they're not omnipotent after all."

With a Final Handoff, He Leaves the Game In Good Hands: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Give Brady his due but let Patrick Mahomes and all of the other young, exciting quarterbacks take it from here.
There is no reason for sadness.
This is a time for celebration and fond remembrance.
Tom Brady retiring at 45, seven Super Bowl rings on his fingers, as he sits comfortably atop the list for nearly every significant passing category in football, is a reminder that time has its way with all of us -- even those who seemed like they had found the fountain of youth.
It is a chance to give Brady his due but also celebrate this: Just as he leaves the game, a new wave of quarterbacks took center stage in this season's playoffs. They are young, confident and collected -- Tom Brady traits -- and they even offer a little more. They possess true out-of-the-pocket mobility and a fleetness of foot that Brady lacked.
Also, this year's Super Bowl will feature two Black starting quarterbacks for the first time, Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts. They are 27 and 24 years old, respectively.
They could be Tom Brady's sons.
Should we be surprised and even skeptical of Brady's retirement announcement? Remember that last year on this date, Brady also announced he was leaving the game. He wrote a heartfelt note and posted it on social media. Months later, itching for the drama of competition, he returned to the game that had defined his life.
Brady nodded to that hiccup in his Instagram post this morning. "I'm retiring ... for good," he said in his video, which, fittingly, he appeared to have shot while hanging out on a beach. "I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning, I figured I'd just press record and let you guys know first."
He continued: "You only get one super emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year."
Stifling tears, he acknowledged family, friends, teammates and fellow competitors. "Thank you, guys, for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn't change a thing. I love you all," he said.
Let's take him at his word. Brady's 13-year marriage to the model Gisele Bündchen ended in divorce last year. He most likely has much in his personal life to attend to. The lavish contract, said to be worth at least $ 375 million over the next decade to be a commentator for Fox Sports as soon as the next season, should help ease the pain of career transition.
This is the right moment.
Brady looked creaky this season. True, he put up good numbers and remained among the league's best passers.
Yet as his team limped to an 8-9 record, barely making the wild-card round of the playoffs, there were games in which he missed target after target, looked lost, and in which a hungrier opponent from the jump poleaxed his team, and him. There he lay at 45, struggling beneath a pile of defensive linemen.
Watching, it was hard not to wonder: Why keep playing?
Why, Tom, after seven Super Bowls and three league M.V.P. awards and a narrative for the ages: the skinny, slow, middle-round draft pick climbs his way to a place on football's Mount Rushmore, sits atop it, stays and stays. Why keep going?
Brady and the Buccaneers' season ended badly: a 31-14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys.
And yet ... it was only two years ago when he won a Super Bowl, beating Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. The safe bet was that Brady would keep going, maybe even try to play until he was 50, perhaps for the San Francisco 49ers, his beloved boyhood team.
The fact that being on an N.F.L. team at a half-century years old seemed possible -- that's surely another sign of his greatness.
What memories he provided. There are far too many to recount here fully, but several stand out. Brady, in 2002, his second season and first as a starter, leading the Patriots over the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl on the wing of a last-minute drive.
Brady -- or should we have called him Tom Houdini? -- in the Super Bowl of 2017, forging an escape for the ages, overcoming a third-quarter score of 28-3 on the way to beating the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28.
Wait, how did he do that? We asked the question with such metronomic constancy as Brady led his teams from the brink that it might as well have been a meme.
Yes, there was luck. Ask any Raiders fan about the notorious Tuck Rule Game. And yes, there were shenanigans. Ask any Indianapolis Colts fan about Deflategate, and they will offer chapter and verse.
Still, luck and bending the rules hardly define him.
What defines Brady, along with all the winning, is the way he bent time.
Off the field, he pushed common notions of longevity in sport with his obsessive, out-of-the-box training: resistance bands instead of weights; water, lots of electrolyte water; sleep, lots of recovery sleep. What did he eat, something like 20 protein-rich, nutrition-packed micro-meals a day?
On the field, well, he was something else to behold. He slowed minutes, owned seconds and put the hours in his hip pocket.
To watch him operate late in a game, everything on the line, his team behind but within striking distance, was to watch something uncanny and ethereal.
Everything could be breaking down into shambles around him, but No. 12 had a way of maintaining composure. Slowly, surely, carefully, he would walk from the huddle toward his center, line up his receivers and survey the scene, tall, sure, and oh-so-confident. And then -- snap -- Brady would deliver a sudden, perfectly placed bolt to his receivers. He did this so often and for so many years (46 fourth-quarter comebacks, 58 game-winning drives) that it took effort to keep from becoming numb to the certainty.
What a glorious ride.
But now, after 23 seasons, it's the right moment to leave.
Mahomes and all of the other young sons of Tom Brady are ready to take it from here.

F.T.C. Accuses GoodRx Of Leaking Health Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The popular drug discount app deceptively shared details on users' illnesses and medicines with ad firms, regulators said in a legal complaint.
Millions of Americans have used GoodRx, a drug discount app, to search for lower prices on prescriptions like antidepressants, H.I.V. medications and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases at their local drugstores. But U.S. regulators say the app's coupons and convenience came at a high cost for users: wrongful disclosure of their intimate health information.
On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission accused the app's developer, GoodRx Holdings, of sharing sensitive personal data on millions of users' prescription medications and illnesses with companies like Facebook and Google without authorization.
The company's information-sharing practices, the agency said, violated a federal rule requiring health apps and fitness trackers that collect personal health details to notify consumers of data breaches.
While GoodRx agreed to settle the case, it said it disagreed with the agency's allegations and admitted no wrongdoing.
The crackdown on GoodRx comes at a moment of heightened concern over the leaking of sensitive health information, particularly in states that have banned or severely limited abortions. And it underscores the F.T.C.'s intensifying efforts to push digital health services to beef up their user privacy and security protections.
The F.T.C.'s case against GoodRx could upend widespread user-profiling and ad-targeting practices in the multibillion-dollar digital health industry, and it puts companies on notice that regulators intend to curb the nearly unfettered trade in consumers' health details.
Over the last two decades, start-ups and giant tech companies have introduced a range of fitness devices, smartwatches and fertility apps. But unlike a person's blood test results and other patient information collected by doctors and hospitals -- which are protected by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA -- personal health details that tens of millions of consumers enter into apps or search for online, like the names of drugs or diseases, are specifically covered by few legal protections.
From 2017 to 2020, GoodRx uploaded the contact information of users who had bought certain medications, like birth control or erectile dysfunction pills, to Facebook so that the drug discount app could identify its users' social media profiles, the F.T.C. said in a legal complaint.
GoodRx then used the personal information to target users with ads for medications on Facebook and Instagram, the complaint said, "all of which was visible to Facebook." GoodRx also targeted users who had looked up information on sexually transmitted diseases on HeyDoctor, the company's telemedicine service, with ads for HeyDoctor's S.T.D. testing services, the complaint said.
Those data disclosures, regulators said, flouted public promises the company had made to "never provide advertisers any information that reveals a personal health condition."
If a judge approves the proposed federal settlement order, GoodRx will be permanently barred from sharing users' health information for advertising purposes. To settle the case, the company also agreed to pay a $ 1.5 million civil penalty for violating the health breach notification rule.
The F.T.C. is employing new legal approaches and remedies in the GoodRx case as part of its effort to bolster safeguards for the personal information collected by health apps, trackers and sites.
This is the first time that the agency has brought an enforcement action using its Health Breach Notification Rule. That rule requires health apps and connected devices that collect or use personal health information, like an individual's heart rate or menstruation history, to notify users of breaches like cyberattacks or the unauthorized sharing of their health data. This is also the first time that a proposed F.T.C. consent order is seeking to prohibit a company from sharing users' health data for advertising purposes.
"Digital health companies and mobile apps should not cash in on consumers' extremely sensitive and personally identifiable health information," Samuel Levine, director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of consumer protection, said in a statement. "The F.T.C. is serving notice that it will use all of its legal authority to protect American consumers' sensitive data from misuse and illegal exploitation."
GoodRx, based in Santa Monica, Calif., said in a statement that user privacy was one of its most important priorities. The company added that the settlement with the agency focused on issues that GoodRx resolved three years ago, before the F.T.C. inquiry began.
"While we had used vendor technologies to advertise in a way that we believe was compliant with all applicable regulations and that remains common practice among many health, consumer and government websites, we are proud that we took action to be an industry leader on privacy practices," the GoodRx statement said.
Since 2017, more than 55 million people have used or visited GoodRx's mobile apps or website, the F.T.C. said. From 2017 to 2020, the company "revealed extremely intimate and sensitive details" to third party ad tech and marketing firms like Facebook, Google, Criteo and Twilio, the complaint said, repeatedly violating its public promises not to do so. The data that was disclosed, the agency said, could link users to chronic physical and mental health issues including substance abuse.
GoodRx also did not put limits on how Facebook, Google and other companies could use its customers' health information, federal regulators said, giving the third parties the ability to use the data for internal business purposes like research and product development. Regulators said GoodRx also "failed to maintain sufficient" protections for users' personal information like adequate formal, written privacy and data-sharing policies.
The F.T.C.'s case centers on GoodRx's use of tracking tools from Facebook, Google and other companies. Millions of sites and apps use such tools -- known as "pixels" and "software development kits" -- to track and share data on their users' activities with third parties for business purposes like ad targeting and user analytics.
Such tracking tools can collect information like users' first and last names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, unique device ID codes, locations, genders and Internet Protocol, or I.P., addresses. They can also record details on user activities like opening an app, clicking on a link or looking at information on a specific illness or medication.
While such data sharing is widespread in consumer sectors like retail and travel, the F.T.C. complaint said GoodRx's use of tracking tools to share personal health data with advertising platforms had led to deceptive and unauthorized data disclosures -- an argument that challenges business as usual in the digital health industry.
GoodRx said it removed the Facebook tracking pixel nearly three years ago.
Over the last few years, the F.T.C. has intensified its focus on health privacy.
In 2021, the F.T.C. accused the developer of Flo, a health tracking app used by more than 100 million women, of misleading users about its data-handling practices by sharing intimate health details about their periods and pregnancies with Google and Facebook. Flo agreed to a settlement with the agency that prohibited the company from misleading users on privacy and required it to obtain consent from them before sharing their health details.
But the agency's case against GoodRx takes a tougher stance. The proposed order against GoodRx would permanently bar the company from sharing its users' health data with third parties for advertising purposes. If approved by a federal judge, the order would also require GoodRx to direct Facebook, Google and other third parties with which it shared details about users' medications and illnesses to delete that information.
In other words, the F.T.C., under its activist chair, Lina M. Khan, is angling to prohibit some longstanding tech industry data practices.
"Going forward, I believe the commission should approach data privacy and security protections by considering substantive limits," Ms. Khan said in a statement in 2021, rather than just procedural protections that tend to sidestep "more fundamental questions about whether certain types of data collection and processing should be permitted in the first place."

'White Lotus' Dance Remix Enthralls Clubgoers: [Style Desk]

Full text: Variations of the spine-tingling intro music have played at rave parties, Australian music festivals and Sundance.
On a recent club night in Chicago, a high-pitched woman's voice that sounded like a gobbling turkey -- dropping acid -- brought everyone to the dance floor. Some people swayed, twisting their hips and twirling their hair in a hypnotic lock step. Others pumped their fists and jumped up and down. One woman let out a high-pitched scream, as though she'd just spotted Chris Hemsworth at the grocery store.
The tune was the EDM dance remix of "Renaissance (Main Title Theme)," the wordless title music that plays over the opening credits of Season 2 of "The White Lotus," the hit HBO Max series about a group of wealthy people who vacation at the luxury resort -- and the people who serve them.
Since the second season, set in Sicily, began in late October, remixes of the oscillating harp notes, written by the Chilean Canadian composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer, have spread across TikTok, SoundCloud and in the EDM community. Remixes are now playing in clubs and at music festivals. Last weekend, at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, Diplo unveiled his own mix at 1:30 a.m.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Renaissance" is a variation on the series's Season 1 theme, "Aloha! -- Main Title Theme," also by Mr. Tapia de Veer, which features drums and bird songs (that season was set in Maui) and won an Emmy for best original main title theme music. "Aloha" had the same choppy melody, though it did not take off on TikTok or spawn a club following like "Renaissance."
What's different about Mr. Tapia de Veer's new beat? Here's how the song became a crowd-pleasing anthem.
Wait, doesn't everyone nowadays just skip past a show's theme song?
Aah, the "skip intro" button debate. When it's the intro song to "The Big Bang Theory"? Yes. When the composer has won an Emmy? Your loss.
When did the song take off on TikTok?
After the first episode of the new season dropped Oct. 30, someone realized: The high-pitched yodeling was danceable. And unlike the Season 1 variation, "Renaissance" climaxes to a throbbing EDM beat near the one-minute mark (the entire song runs 1 minute and 38 seconds long).
Over the next few months, thousands of videos flooded the platform, with users setting the ethereal earworm to their own kooky dance moves, frying eggs and lawn manicuring.
Why can't I get it out of my head?
Edward Venn, a professor of music at Leeds University in England, broke it down for British GQ in the fall: "It's the way that the initial minor chord moves to the major -- offering a sense of hope, of respite -- only for it to slide back, continually and unstoppably, to the threatening implications of that minor chord," he said.
So how did it get into clubs?
For weeks, Twitter, TikTok and Instagram users have been sharing videos of partygoers dancing ecstatically as the twisted operatic notes soar through basement bars and packed clubs.
The rapper and "Euphoria" star Dominic Fike closed a set at the Terminal 5 music venue in Manhattan with the eerie melody in December, the latest instance of a tune from TV becoming a party staple (we see you, Wednesday Addams and your jerky, infectious "Goo Goo Muck" dance).
Where else has it shown up?
It turns out that the operatic discothèque sound bath -- punctuated by human screeches -- works just as well on a large scale as a small one. The Killers opened several stadium shows in December with the song.
Days before the show's finale, a music festival in Australia played the song, to which many in the crowd of thousands of bucket-hatted and fanny-packed revelers tried to vocalize -- erm, sing? -- along.
A heart-pounding remix of the ululating anthem even made an appearance at the end of a "Saturday Night Live" skit last weekend, played by another pop culture phenom: the killer robot doll M3gan, the newly minted camp horror icon with some dance moves of her own.
What are some of the best remixes?
One popular mash-up features Jennifer Coolidge and her meme-ready rant: "Please, these gays. They're trying to murder me." Another, unveiled by the Dutch D.J. Tiësto at a Miami Beach club on New Year's Eve, makes you want to bang your head until you can't feel your face. And there is a luscious tech house beat by Westend that will have your stereo shaking.
"It captured the feral nature that's inside all of us and that especially comes out on the dance floor," said Tyler Morris, a New York-based D.J. and music producer who spins under the name Westend. "Every time I play it in my D.J. sets, it's a showstopper."
How do you dance to it?
Fist pumps, waving arms and synchronized -- or not -- flailing limbs seem to be popular. The robot -- or even a fast-moving zombie imitation à la "The Last of Us" -- might work well here.
Any word on the theme music for Season 3?
While the show has been renewed for a third season, there's no word yet on the next resort destination. The only thing that might be more popular than the EDM "Renaissance"? A K-pop version.

A Wardrobe's Political Messages: [Style Desk]

Full text: For once, a politician who wasn't afraid of fashion.
Last September, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand who announced recently that she was stepping down after almost six years in power, did something heads of state rarely do. She modeled in a fashion show.
Wearing a high-neck cape glimmering with what appeared to be electrified seed pods over a long blue dress and bare feet, she stood on a runway for the opening event of World of Wearable Art, an annual international design competition in Wellington that was restarting after a two-year pandemic hiatus. She looked sort of like an alien priestess from the Marvel cinematic universe, and also like it was no big deal.
Except, of course, it was. And not just because it attracted attention ("What? The PM? Modeling?") to the reopening of an important economic sector.
Ms. Ardern may have been known on the international stage for many things as a leader, but her wardrobe was rarely among them. She was known, for example, for getting her country successfully through Covid; for her deft handling of a mass shooting at two mosques; for espousing "kindness politics"; for becoming, at 37, one of the youngest prime ministers ever elected in New Zealand; for having a baby while in office; and now, for being one of the rare officials who resigned of their own accord.
Yet throughout her time in office she also always understood that fashion is a political tool -- one she wielded so easily and subtly in the service of her agenda that most people didn't even realize it was happening.
In doing so, she was at the forefront of a new generation of women in politics, including Sanna Marin, the prime minister of Finland, with her leathers and denim, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, with her hoops and red lipstick, all of whom have eschewed the uniform sameness of the women who came before. Those include politicians like Angela Merkel, Kamala Harris (currently taking refuge in a series of dark trouser suits), even Margaret Thatcher, with her pussy bows. Instead, they are crafting their own idiosyncratic leadership style, one that treats the issue of image-making as an opportunity rather than a liability.
One that recognizes in the visual age, it's as much a part of communications strategy as any official statement, and that "personal appearance" doesn't just mean showing up.
It's a pretty significant shift.
For decades, after all, women in politics have been in a defensive crouch when it comes to clothing, seeing it as a banner of gender often used to paint them as superficial and less substantive than their male counterparts. The solution was to adopt -- or adapt -- the male uniform. To claim, if asked, that they "never think about clothes." And then to wear pretty much the same thing day in and day out.
From the beginning of her tenure in 2017, though, Ms. Ardern took a different approach. One that weaponized her wardrobe to her own ends rather than letting it be weaponized against her. She used fashion as a form of outreach, not just as a way to support and market local industry (though she did that, too), but as a way to connect with her constituencies on a personal level.
"She proved that women in leadership positions could be approachable," said Emilia Wickstead, a New Zealand-born designer based in London whose dress Ms. Ardern wore when she visited Boris Johnson on her first trip to Britain since the pandemic began. And she did in part through her clothes.
She wore New Zealand designers almost exclusively from her first election night, when she donned a burgundy jacket and matching shirt by the New Zealand label Maaike. And not just one label: many. (A brief list includes Juliette Hogan, Kate Sylvester, Ingrid Starnes, Karen Walker, Jessica McCormack and Ms. Wickstead.) She wore them when she was photographed for American Vogue; when Meghan Markle chose her for the cover of the British Vogue she guest-edited; and for the cover of Time magazine. She wore a bright pink Juliette Hogan suit on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."
And she defined "New Zealand designers" as broadly as possible, wearing a traditional Maori kahu huruhuru feather cape -- a symbol of power and respect -- to the Commonwealth dinner in Buckingham Palace in 2018, and donning a feather stole for the queen's funeral in September, custom-made by the Maori designer Kiri Nathan. (She also wore the feather cape for her last official speech to the country, given in honor of the 150th birthday of the prophet Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana, the Maori spiritual leader.)
The representation and symbolism, at two major international events that most of the world experienced only in photos, make a clear point.
As it did, perhaps most memorably, when she donned a black head scarf to demonstrate her solidarity with the Muslim community after an Australian gunman shot 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch, transforming what was often seen as a lightning rod for public debate and prejudice into a statement of community.
When, last April, Ms. Ardern reopened the borders to Australians as the pandemic eased and showed up at the airport to welcome them, she told a news show that she had deliberately worn a green dress because green and gold are the national colors of Australia. She laughed about it, but that didn't make it any less revelatory.
Or effective. Indeed, poking fun at her clothes became one of her trademarks. She told The New Yorker in 2018 that she was wearing two pairs of Spanx when she made an appearance on "The Late Show." In 2020, she posted a close-up of a pink jacket on Instagram with the note, "Why is it only when you are the furtherest you could possibly be from a change of clothes before you notice that you have nappy cream on you?"
After being in Covid isolation, she posted a picture with the caption, "Somehow though I'm still finishing the evening in the same hoodie I've been wearing for days."
For any future student of power studying relatability 101, it should be required reading.

Tom Brady’s Retirement Is the Best Thing for Football

There is no reason for sadness.
This is a time for celebration and fond remembrance.
Tom Brady retiring at 45, seven Super Bowl rings on his fingers, as he sits comfortably atop the list for nearly every significant passing category in football, is a reminder that time has its way with all of us — even those who seemed like they had found the fountain of youth.
It is a chance to give Brady his due but also celebrate this: Just as he leaves the game, a new wave of quarterbacks took center stage in this season’s playoffs. They are young, confident and collected — Tom Brady traits — and they even offer a little more. They possess true out-of-the-pocket mobility and a fleetness of foot that Brady lacked.
Also, this year’s Super Bowl will feature two Black starting quarterbacks for the first time, Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia’s Jalen Hurts. They are 27 and 24 years old, respectively.
They could be Brady’s sons.
Should we be surprised and even skeptical of Brady’s retirement announcement? Remember that last year on this date, Brady also announced he was leaving the game. He wrote a heartfelt note and posted it on social media. Months later, itching for the drama of competition, he returned to the game that had defined his life.
Brady nodded to that hiccup in his Instagram post Wednesday morning. “I’m retiring … for good,” he said in his video, which, fittingly, he appeared to have shot while hanging out on a beach. “I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first.”
He continued: “You only get one super emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year.”
Stifling tears, he acknowledged family, friends, teammates and fellow competitors. “Thank you, guys, for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn’t change a thing. I love you all,” he said.
Let’s take him at his word. Brady’s 13-year marriage to model Gisele Bündchen ended in divorce last year. He most likely has much in his personal life to attend to. The lavish contract, said to be worth at least $375 million over the next decade to be a commentator for Fox Sports as soon as next season, should help ease the pain of career transition.
This is the right moment.
Brady looked creaky this season. True, he put up good numbers and remained among the league’s best passers.
Yet as his team limped to an 8-9 record, barely making the wild-card round of the playoffs, there were games in which he missed target after target, looked lost, and in which a hungrier opponent from the jump poleaxed his team, and him. There he lay at 45, struggling beneath a pile of defensive linemen.
Watching, it was hard not to wonder: Why keep playing?
Why, Tom, after seven Super Bowls and three league MVP awards and a narrative for the ages: the skinny, slow, middle-round draft pick climbs his way to a place on football’s Mount Rushmore, sits atop it, stays and stays. Why keep going?
Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ season ended badly: a 31-14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys.
And yet … it was only two years ago when he won a Super Bowl, beating Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. The safe bet was that Brady would keep going, maybe even try to play until he was 50, perhaps for the San Francisco 49ers, his beloved boyhood team.
The fact that being on an NFL team at a half-century years old seemed possible — that’s surely another sign of his greatness.
What memories he provided. There are far too many to recount here fully, but several stand out. Brady, in 2002, his second season and first as a starter, leading the New England Patriots over the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl on the wing of a last-minute drive.
Brady — or should we have called him Tom Houdini? — in the Super Bowl of 2017, forging an escape for the ages, overcoming a third-quarter score of 28-3 on the way to beating the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28.
Wait, how did he do that? We asked the question with such metronomic constancy as Brady led his teams from the brink that it might as well have been a meme.
Yes, there was luck. Ask any Raiders fan about the notorious Tuck Rule Game. And yes, there were shenanigans. Ask any Indianapolis Colts fan about Deflategate, and they will offer chapter and verse.
Still, luck and bending the rules hardly define him.
What defines Brady, along with all the winning, is the way he bent time.
Off the field, he pushed common notions of longevity in sport with his obsessive, out-of-the-box training: resistance bands instead of weights; water, lots of electrolyte water; sleep, lots of recovery sleep. What did he eat, something like 20 protein-rich, nutrition-packed micro-meals a day?
On the field, well, he was something else to behold. He slowed minutes, owned seconds and put the hours in his hip pocket.
To watch him operate late in a game, everything on the line, his team behind but within striking distance, was to watch something uncanny and ethereal.
Everything could be breaking down into shambles around him, but No. 12 had a way of maintaining composure. Slowly, surely, carefully, he would walk from the huddle toward his center, line up his receivers and survey the scene, tall, sure and oh-so-confident. And then — snap — Brady would deliver a sudden, perfectly placed bolt to his receivers. He did this so often and for so many years (46 fourth-quarter comebacks, 58 game-winning drives) that it took effort to keep from becoming numb to the certainty.
What a glorious ride.
But now, after 23 seasons, it’s the right moment to leave.
Mahomes and all of the other young sons of Tom Brady are ready to take it from here. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Tech Downturn Chips Away at Snap's Revenue Growth: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The maker of Snapchat also swung to a loss in the latest quarter and projected that its sales would decline.
Snap, the maker of the messaging app Snapchat, on Tuesday posted its slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth and projected that its sales for the current quarter would fall, in another sign of the tech industry's slowdown.
Revenue was $ 1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, up 0.1 percent from a year earlier. The company also swung to a net loss of $ 288 million, as spending increased nearly 20 percent from a year earlier. Snap had reported its first and only quarterly profit as a public company a year ago.
Snap's challenges appear to be mounting. In a letter to investors, the company said revenue so far in the current quarter had declined 7 percent from a year earlier. It added that its internal forecasts for the current quarter assumed that revenue would fall between 2 percent and 10 percent, which would be its first revenue drop as a public company.
In an earnings call, Evan Spiegel, Snap's chief executive, said that "advertising demand hasn't really improved, but it hasn't gotten significantly worse." He had earlier added in a statement that Snap continued to "face significant headwinds as we look to accelerate revenue growth."
The company's shares plunged more than 14 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Last year, Snap's share price fell more than 80 percent.
The results cap a difficult year for Snap, with little relief ahead. Persistent inflation and high interest rates have made advertisers -- the company's main source of revenue -- reluctant to spend, while privacy changes by Apple have made it more difficult for social media companies to track and target users in their mobile advertising.
TikTok has also stolen advertising business from Snap and other platforms. The Chinese-owned video app, which Snap has called one of its "very large and very sophisticated competitors," has attracted brands with its reach and cultural cachet, particularly among young people.
Digital advertising has slumped along with the global economy. But Snap has struggled more than its rivals because advertisers tend to begin budget cuts with smaller companies, instead of juggernauts like Facebook and Instagram, said Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester. In August, Snap laid off 20 percent of its employees, discontinued at least six products and lost several executives.
"Marketers are nervous about their economic outlook," Ms. Chickering said. "They're moving their budgets into places that are proven to be effective."
One potential bright spot for Snap was its user growth, with daily active users increasing 17 percent, to 375 million in the fourth quarter. Even so, that was slightly less than the 378 million users that Wall Street analysts had predicted.
In the earnings call on Thursday, Derek Andersen, Snap's chief financial officer, said the company could still grow its advertising business through features like its TikTok clone, Spotlight. But, he added, advertisers had to use those features.
"Demand is the lacking portion of things," he said.

With a New Project, Chef Aims to 'Change People's Perspective' in Ivory Coast: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The chef Roze Traore has spent years building a name for himself in New York, but for his new project, he's tapping his family ties to West Africa.
The chef and model Roze Traore has checked the big-name boxes in New York City that lead to prominence in his dual professions.
Mr. Traore's résumé includes stints at Eleven Madison Park and the restaurant at the NoMad Hotel. He's worked as a private chef for high-profile clients, including the Soho House, a private club in Manhattan's meatpacking district, and last year he catered the Guggenheim International Gala. His modeling career has landed him gigs with Cole Haan and Louis Vuitton.
Now, he's headed to the West African nation of Ivory Coast, where he's opened a boutique hotel and restaurant in a palm-tree-lined beach resort area called Grand-Bassam.
"I want to make another contribution to the beautiful things in this country," Mr. Traore said. "I want to change people's perspective."
For years, tourism across Francophone Africa appealed largely to French retirees who clung to lazy days at big resorts on azure coastlines. But Mr. Traore's hotel, La Fourchette de Roze, opens at a time when a new audience of young Americans and other Westerners is being lured to the region by top-notch surf breaks and fashion festivals in Senegal and art shows in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast and beyond.
Mr. Traore, 31, who was born in Washington, D.C., and whose parents are Ivorian, spent part of his childhood in Ivory Coast. The country is bouncing back after the pandemic slowed tourism and from the taint of a deadly terrorist attack seven years ago. Tourists are again arriving in Grand-Bassam, drawn to its fishing culture, colonial architecture and laid-back beach vibe.
"It feels so incredibly natural to open my first establishment on this land where my ancestors settled and to be surrounded by so many resources," said Mr. Traore, who was on site this month to put the finishing touches on the Jan. 19 grand opening, including installing the first of what he expects to be a rotating exhibition of local artists.
Mr. Traore is passionate about style, whether in the form of food, fashion or art. I first met him four years ago at a gallery opening for the artist Kehinde Wiley, who has started his own ventures in the region with an artist residency in Dakar, Senegal's capital. On a recent drizzly day in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Traore spoke to me about his new project as he peered out over the East River from a perch at the elegant private club Casa Cipriani.
Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Your career has gotten a lot of traction in the United States, including your work at the Guggenheim and curating a menu for an event featuring the actress Lupita Nyong'o. Why divert to an entirely different project so far away?
For the past 10 years, my whole career has been so focused on working on my craft and building a name for myself in the States. I love my roots, and I've always kept my eye on the Ivory Coast as a place I feel instinctively connected and indebted to. This is another step I felt was perfect as I continue to build myself into a household name. Going back to the Ivory Coast keeps me grounded and is a true connection to my roots.
Tell me more about your roots.
I lived in Ivory Coast when I was younger. It was a place where I had these small moments that turned me into a chef -- being surrounded by a community, going to the market, enjoying good food with my grandparents. My mom came to the United States and did what she was used to doing in Ivory Coast, which was hair braiding. She opened two salons in Washington, D.C., that are still running to this day. She made a name for herself there. She went back and forth to Ivory Coast and started building up a real estate business. She's a hard-working entrepreneur.
What role did your mother play in your career?
At first she didn't really understand what I was doing, but now she gets it. She said, "Maybe it's the time for us to work together." She bought the property, and we built it up together. This place in Ivory Coast, it was just very wholesome because my dad was a fisherman. It felt great to finally be able to say I'm thankful for where I'm at, for the opportunities that I've gained in the States, and I want to return to this place. I've always liked small boutiques where you're able to focus more. This will be like my house, where I can welcome people and have them enjoy my energy.
As a model and a chef, you must believe that presentation is important. Describe the hotel for me.
The hotel has boutique vibes and a very clean look. There are only six rooms. I'm going to have the classics on the menu, the local fare like braised fish with plantain leaves and attiéké (a cassava-based side dish similar to couscous). Nothing too heavy, nothing too hectic. I come from the gastro world, but I enjoy Ivorian food. I'm not here to change the cuisine, and I'm not trying to have a stuffy place. I'm not saying I want to bring three Michelin stars to Ivory Coast. We'll have elevated cuisine that appeals to a casual crowd. Depending on the hours, you'll be able to get a quick meal and sit on the beach and chill. We'll also accommodate V.I.P.s on occasion, but it's not corporate. It's just my mom and me.
You've had a traditional career as a chef, paying your dues at esteemed restaurants and working under well-known chefs. And you've had a traditional modeling career. But being both a model and a chef is unique. Has that helped you distinguish yourself?
Race plays a big role in my story as a chef as I am very often the only Black man on the line in the kitchen. This attribute makes me different than my culinary peers, as does my former life as a model. I like the communication between what looks good and what feels good. All my career, I've done fine dining. But this time of year, people always call me to make appearances for Black History Month. I'm interested in fine dining, but they want me to cook African food or soul food. I've stopped answering those calls.

Help! I Reserved a Rental Car, But There Was No Car for Me.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A reader's reservation got her nowhere with Alamo (and Avis didn't pull through either), raising the question of why rental companies have such a bad record of delivering the cars they promise.
Dear Tripped Up,
My husband and I often fly to Atlanta and rent a car at the airport for the 90-mile final leg to our lake house. Two weeks before our Dec. 6 trip, I made a reservation through Alamo. But when we got to the counter, an employee told me they were totally out of cars. I thought he was joking -- I had a reservation -- but he wasn't. So I got on my phone, saw Avis had cars available, and reserved with them. After a wait at the Avis counter, an employee told me he couldn't give me a car because they were prioritizing people who had booked in advance. We ended up in an expensive Uber. Can you explain how car rental companies can take a reservation and then not have a car waiting for you? Shouldn't they at least alert us in advance, so we could make other arrangements? Renee, Carmel, Ind.
Dear Renee,
Car rental companies have frustratingly variable definitions of the word "reservation," ranging from "whimsical notion" to "binding agreement." Something is out of whack here, and has been at least since the Dec. 4, 1991, episode of "Seinfeld," when Jerry steps up to the counter to find the midsize vehicle he has reserved is unavailable.
"You know how to take the reservation," he berates the poor attendant. "You just don't know how to hold the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding."
In the end, Jerry's predicament turned out to be nothing compared with yours: The clerk offers him a compact car and he accepts. That's a dime-a-dozen inconvenience that anyone who rents cars regularly has experienced, but it is a result of the same quirky industry practice: Unlike hotels and airlines, car rental companies typically allow customers to reserve a car with no prepayment or even a credit card. That means there is usually no penalty for no-shows, making it harder for companies to predict fleet availability, sometimes relegating large families to small sedans and occasionally leading to experiences like yours.
So I beg to differ with Jerry: Rental car companies don't know how to take a reservation. And I agree with you -- the least companies could do is get in touch with customers when they are running out of cars and suggest they make other arrangements.
I reached out to Alamo and Avis to discuss your issue, and for good measure spoke with Hertz, so all three American car rental conglomerates were represented. (Alamo is owned by Enterprise Holdings.)
That led a manager at the Atlanta Alamo agency to get in touch with you and offer to pay for your Uber from the airport, which, as Mike Wilmering, an Alamo spokesman, told me via email, is what the company did for other customers that day.
Beth Gibson, vice president for customer experience at Avis, was a bit befuddled, telling me that, according to company records, Avis did not run out of cars that day and in fact took 70 walk-in customers, far more than usual. Ms. Gibson did say that on rare occasions, the Avis system implements a "hard suspend" of reservations for a period of time when demand is too high, but there was no record of that happening the day you tried to get a car.
So what happened that day at Alamo? "We have a team that closely monitors our bookings and inventory to ensure vehicles are available for those who reserved one," wrote Mr. Wilmering, "but extenuating circumstances can, at times, disrupt this." On Dec. 6, the company experienced "an unexpected surge in demand, coupled with multiple vehicles not returned, we also had several vehicles that were due for maintenance and/or repair."
That doesn't explain why Alamo would run out of cars. Nothing was forcing the company to accept those additional reservations. Having cars "due for maintenance" also strikes me as an odd excuse, since it seems highly foreseeable. Mr. Wilmering did not specify how many cars were not returned or were in for repair, but it must have been a lot more than usual or it doesn't make sense for Alamo not to have cut off reservations as well. (Dec. 6 was the day of the Senate runoff election in Georgia, which both companies suggested may have contributed to the spike in demand.)
Alamo would typically be able to source cars from other Enterprise brands with agencies at the airport, but "we exhausted all possible options to provide vehicles to customers who needed them," Mr. Wilmering wrote. He said Alamo has no centralized system to alert customers if no cars are available, and that individual branches would be responsible for communicating with customers.
This left me with two nagging questions: What can consumers do to ensure a car is waiting for them? And, if hotels and airlines require payment in advance (or at least a penalty for no-shows), why not car rental companies?
Jonathan Weinberg, the founder and chief executive of AutoSlash, a car rental site that searches for the best deals, told me that the car rental agencies originally offered risk-free reservations as a consumer-friendly policy and now are reluctant to drop a perk consumers have come to expect.
"Certainly, it's a failure on the rental car companies' part to both predict and manage the inventory properly," he said. "It becomes more challenging for them in times of high demand." The problem worsened, he said, coming out of the pandemic, as both fleets and maintenance staff had shrunk, but he said the problem is very rare, occurring in well under 1 percent of the rentals his company handles.
To seek advice on how customers can be sure a car -- and preferably the one they reserved -- is there, I asked not only company representatives, but also called customer service lines to ask whoever answered. Advice was all over the place and frustratingly devoid of promises, leaving me with the sneaking suspicion that companies simply give cars away in the order people show up, no matter who they are or how or when they reserved.
The best advice came from a customer service representative from Alamo, who recommended calling the branch directly as your travel date approaches. (It's easy to find the branch numbers by clicking on "Locations" on alamo.com.) They can let you know if there is an increase in demand for your dates that might mean it's worth having a plan B, he said.
An Avis representative had a different take, telling me the best way to ensure you get a car is to register for Avis Preferred, a loyalty program. She told me it was easy and free, and she was right. (I'm their latest member.) Ms. Gibson agreed, and added that prepaying would also make you a higher priority. Another pro tip: She recommended taking the extra minute or two to provide your flight information when you book a car, which allows the agency to automatically adjust your arrival time if your plane is late.
The biggest news came from Hertz, which now requires that renters provide a credit-card number when making a reservation. Customers who do not cancel before their pickup time are charged for one day's rental. Lauren Luster, a Hertz spokeswoman, said that the new policy was put in place last February at all corporate branches in the United States, in part to better control inventory and reduce the chances a customer would arrive and not find an appropriate car waiting. Kudos to Hertz, which took the leap a mere 31 years after that "Seinfeld" episode first aired. Progress, nonetheless.

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 22-28)
Job Cuts, and Not Just in Tech
What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Tech's challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector -- employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts -- but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.
A Growing Economy
Despite what might seem to be obvious harbingers of an economic downturn -- mass layoffs, for example -- there are other signs of relative health. Take gross domestic product, an indicator that was not as reliable at the beginning of the pandemic but has since normalized. The latest report on G.D.P., when adjusted for inflation, shows the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, suggesting that it has been largely resilient in the face of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though just a few months ago, G.D.P. numbers met one commonplace standard for determining a recession, the most recent data would seem to assuage fears. But only to a certain extent -- many economists still expect a recession to begin later this year.
Elon Musk Takes the Stand
More than four years after he posted a tweet telling his followers that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private, Elon Musk, now the chief executive of both Tesla and Twitter, appeared in court to defend that statement against a lawsuit. He provided seven hours of testimony over three days, arguing that funding for a deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was plentiful but dodging a question about whether a specific dollar amount had been discussed. In the 2018 tweet, Mr. Musk suggested that he had secured $ 420 a share (a favorite number of the billionaire's). Lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of Tesla investors, are trying to build a case to prove that Mr. Musk's actions led to the wild swings in Tesla's stock, causing them to lose money. Some experts believe they are likely to succeed: Last year, the senior U.S. District Court judge hearing the case ruled that he agreed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Musk was "deliberately reckless" -- investors' words -- when he posted the tweet.
What's Next? (Jan. 29-Feb. 4)
A Smaller Rate Increase?
The Federal Reserve took its first step toward slowing its interest rate increases last month, when it broke a streak of aggressive three-quarter-point increases with a half-point one. At its meeting on Tuesday, the central bank may opt to slow its pace further. In recent weeks, Fed officials including Susan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, have discussed the possibility of a quarter-point move. "There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase," Mr. Waller said. But he echoed his colleagues in emphasizing that their campaign to fight inflation was not over yet, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has made clear officials' intention to raise the policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of the year.
Labor Market Resilience
The jobs report on Friday will provide the first glimpse at the strength of the labor market in 2023 -- though it is expected to look a lot like the end of 2022. That is to say, like recent months of jobs reports, this one is expected to show another month of solid but slowing growth. The question is, how long can these conditions last? While the labor market has long been buoyant in defiance of the Fed's attempts to cool the economy, the higher interest rates are still slowly permeating through the economy.
Slower Growth for Tech Companies
After a stretch of bad news for the country's largest tech companies, this week's quarterly earnings reports are poised to deliver ... more bad news. Microsoft helped kicked off the tech-sector portion of earnings season last week by reporting its slowest growth in six years. Amazon, which will release its quarterly results on Thursday, the same day as Alphabet and Apple, is expected to report exceptionally slow growth -- the slowest in two decades, analysts predict. While Amazon and its peers may be hurting, these companies continue to bring in billions in profit, and some are making big investments even as they say their aim with layoffs is to trim costs. Days after announcing plans to cut 10,000 jobs, Microsoft, for example, said it planned to invest $ 10 billion in the artificial intelligence lab behind the chatbot ChatGPT.
What Else?
Live Nation Entertainment, the parent of Ticketmaster, which canceled its plans to sell tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming tour, was cast as a monopoly by top Democrats during a Senate hearing (some used Ms. Swift's lyrics to make their point). A glitch on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday led to wild price swings for major stocks, adding or wiping out billions in market value. Meta said it would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump's Instagram and Facebook accounts "in the coming weeks."

'Avatar' Villain Has a Wholesome Day: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Stephen Lang is perhaps best known for playing the nefarious, strong and lithe Colonel Miles Quaritch in "Avatar." But if long marriages are any indicator, the stage and screen actor, 70, is more of a good guy: He and his wife, Kristina Lang, a costume designer, have been married for 43 years. They split their time between a house in the Hudson Valley and a brownstone in Harlem, which they share with one of their four children, Lucy Lang, the New York State inspector general, and her family. When the couple is in Harlem, their miniature dachshund, Ginger, "sort of a living hot water bottle," he said, comes with them.
HERE'S THE DEAL I generally wake up around 4 a.m. Part of the reason is Ginger starts shaking her ears and makes a sound that means she's ready to go out. I give her an early breakfast, then anywhere between 4 and 5 a.m., I have two cups of coffee. I have the two cups of coffee because I want all my plumbing to be in good shape for the day. The plumbing needs to be clear because, here's the deal, I'm about to go do yoga. You said you wanted me to get granular. I'm getting granular.
NONTOXIC When the yoga studios closed down for the pandemic, I put stuff in our place to do yoga, like a full-length mirror and a little space heater. I can get a 60- or 90-minute class via Zoom, although I am usually back at the studio now. When I started doing yoga it was called Bikram yoga, but we don't call it that anymore. We call it 26&2 yoga because Bikram has become a toxic word because of the person who invented it. However, the yoga process is very, very divorced from that.
CITY GUY My daughter Lucy, and her husband and children, occupy the top three floors of our brownstone -- we co-own it -- and my wife and I have the garden apartment for when we're in the city, which at various times in life can be a lot or, during the pandemic, not at all. But I'm a city guy, born and bred. I know the city. When I finish my yoga, we'll probably have some kind of event we're going to or maybe the theater. But if not, I'll take a long walk. If you're a New Yorker, you know that walking is basically the best mode of transportation aside from the train.
THE FAMILY BENCH My favorite part of New York is Central Park, so I love to go down there and take a good walk all around. I could traverse the entire park, and I've done it many times. I often wind up on 72nd Street on the East Side where we have a bench we call Terry's bench. My mother bought the bench and dedicated it to my father. When you give money, maybe to the conservancy, you get a plaque on a bench. I like to go sit there and have a little conversation with my mom. She died in 2008. If you come along and someone is sitting on what you consider your bench, you can't really say, "Excuse me, that's my bench, get off it." Or you could say that, but they're New Yorkers. They would look at you and say, "Sit on this, pal."
THE BUS If I don't feel like walking all the way back across the park, I might take the M10 bus back up to Central Park West. I'm glad the M10 is still there. I believe several years ago, they were going to cut back on its service but all the riders rose up in protest. Before the yoga studio got shut down, I'd take the M10 there for the 5:30 a.m. class, to 72nd between Columbus and Amsterdam. I enjoy riding the bus in New York City tremendously, especially that time of day when it's quiet and the bus driver a lot of times will embrace his inner NASCAR driver and you will see all the animals, like raccoons, darting back into the park after they've been out all night trash hunting. Rats? Rats are a whole other thing.
MEMORY MUSCLE I used to memorize something every day. "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" by Robert Browning is one of the most beautiful pieces of poetry, and it's also a cautionary tale about rats, speaking of rats. My head is too crammed now to memorize something every day. I memorize what I need to memorize for work. But now I go through some of the old stuff. I used to know a lot of Shakespeare, and you've got to kind of keep working on it to make sure it stays in your brain.
RITUALIZED When you talk to actors, so much of what we do could be considered routine, but it's actually ritual. They're ceremonial things that kind of empower us to get the necessary result. In Jane Lynch's Routine, I read that she eats two peanut butter cups before a performance, then at intermission she eats two more. I understand there's a certain energy jolt that can result from that, but at the same time, it's ritualized behavior. And it struck me as absolutely normal, because all the stuff I do is ritualized, whether it be yoga or karate or weight lifting. It brings about a desired state of preparedness, even if it's just a question of being in a good emotional and mental state.
ON SLEEP I can take a nap anywhere. It can be six minutes. I think they're restorative. I think they recalibrate you. You always wake up renewed and refreshed. For some reason Americans, we're ashamed of napping. You know when you call someone and you can kind of tell you woke them up and they'll go, "No, no, no, I wasn't sleeping." And you want to say, "Yes, you were, and it's good. It's good to sleep during the day." I've been a believer in naps since college. This is not something I've adopted since I've gotten older.
DINNER PARTY Everyone in my family is a good cook. I'm certainly not the best among them. Both our sons live in L.A. -- they're both in the movie business as well -- but our daughters are local, and they could come over for dinner with their families, or maybe some friends or extended family will come. We're always feeding people. I remember one Thanksgiving, I didn't know half the people at our friggin' table.
ACADEMY DUTIES Then I would probably try to get the TV working and end up calling my son-in-law to say, "Can you please get this going for me so we can watch some Netflix?" We try to watch all the movies we have to watch so I can vote for the Oscars with some integrity rather than voting for movies I've acted in. Possibly the people who have come for dinner will be there but hopefully not because I've got to put my pajamas on. Remember, I'm getting up at 4 a.m.

Full text: In a series of long queues at restaurants and retail stores across New York City, one Metro writer discovered an unexpected thing: pure, unadulterated joy.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
What is worth standing outside in the cold on Christmas Day? That question came up while I was having brunch with my family at Lafayette Grand Café & Bakery in Manhattan and noticed a line forming outside the window of the restaurant.
In New York City, the holiday was frigid, with a predicted high of 27 degrees, and yet the queue of people continued to grow. The server informed us that the line was for the restaurant's biggest draw: a Suprême, a spiraling, cream-filled, round croissant that I realized I had seen on social media. And no, we couldn't order one for the table. If we wanted one, we'd have to join the line. We declined, but I thought about some other lines I'd seen recently, such as the one in front of the bakery L'Appartement 4F in Brooklyn Heights.
Unlike the long lines for Covid-19 testing, and the long processions for vaccinations, the ones for these bakeries were filled with people eager and excited to wait for their prize. A few days later, I made a pitch to my editor: What are people in New York lining up for now? I tried to answer that question in a Metro article published this week.
Before the on-the-ground reporting began, I created a spreadsheet with input from friends and colleagues. It detailed a variety of lines, their locations in the city and the best days of the week and times of day for line encounters. The editors on Metro and I decided to focus on just the newest-formed lines (which meant skipping those at New York favorites, such as Joe's Pizza or Prince Street Pizza) and to limit ourselves to five locations. The photographer Yuvraj Khanna joined me for all of the outings.
We visited our first line on a Wednesday outside the New York Theater Workshop, where hopeful attendees of "Merrily We Roll Along" were waiting to purchase possible last-minute tickets for the musical. I asked some of the people at the end of the line what they thought their chances were of getting one, and three of them replied "zero," in unison. But people were still generally happy to chat with me, perhaps because it gave them something to do. One person was crocheting, one was working on a laptop and a few people were wearing headphones. Others simply chose to stand there.
While some people in the line expected to go home without seeing the musical, Friday's line at Lafayette Grand Café & Bakery was different; everyone left happy. All those who lined up for a Suprême were able to get one -- and put it on Instagram immediately, if they wanted to.
When my alarm went off at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, I was not in the mood to stand outside a bakery in Brooklyn Heights. The weather was bleak and cold with flurries. Once I got there, though, the bleary-eyed and bundled-up fans of the baked goods were friendly and funny. One man was wearing shorts, and explained that he had just finished his morning run and was visiting Brooklyn from Minneapolis.
Another man, who said he lived five blocks away from the bakery, shared that getting croissants for his family had become part of his Saturday routine; his wife likes chocolate, his son likes almond, his daughter likes plain. "But the prize is the bread," he said. "The boules are fabulous."
On Sunday, a line for eggs on the Upper West Side was full of locals who greeted the seller warmly. Some had arrived with empty egg cartons for the vendor to refill. I thought about what Benton McClintock, a TikTok comedian who hates lines, said in my interview with him. His theory was that some of the queues created a perpetual loop. By waiting in line, he said, people are "not developing a relationship with those businesses. You're just creating more clout for them to create longer lines and perpetuate this kind of weird cycle."
But for me, the lines were not just about pastries or brunch. Queuing up provides a built-in optimism, in which we pause instead of rush and chat with people on the sidewalk instead of passing them by. Those are radical breaks from the norm in the city. And though I personally don't like waiting in line, I admired the patience and calm of those who lined up.
Almost everyone waiting was hoping for the best. And as they say, good things can come to those who wait.

Ads Fueling Truth Social: Junk, Scams: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Thompson, Stuart A

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Between posts about conspiracy theories and right-wing grievances was an unusual advertisement: a photo of former President Donald J. Trump holding a $ 1,000 bill made of gold, which he was apparently offering free to supporters.
But there were a few catches: The bill was not free, it was not made of gold, and it was not offered by Mr. Trump.
The ad appeared on Truth Social, the right-wing social network started by Mr. Trump in late 2021, one of many pitches from hucksters and fringe marketers dominating the ads on the site.
Ads from major brands are nonexistent on the site. Instead, the ads on Truth Social are for alternative medicine, diet pills, gun accessories and Trump-themed trinkets, according to an analysis of hundreds of ads on the social network by The New York Times.
The ads reflect the difficulty that several far-right platforms, including Rumble and Gab, have faced in courting large brands, preventing the sites from tapping into some of the world's largest ad budgets. It could be particularly problematic for Truth Social. Although the site has gained influence among the far right, becoming a vibrant ecosystem brimming with activity, its business is in need of cash.
Truth Social raised about $ 37 million, mainly from Republican political donors, but it is burning through about $ 1.7 million each month, according to William Wilkinson, a former executive at Trump Media & Technology Group, the social network's parent company. And two federal investigations have put about $ 1.3 billion of much-needed funding in jeopardy.
Devin Nunes, the chief executive of Trump Media, said in an announcement last year that the company's ad strategy would help it "displace the Big Tech platforms" as a major way to reach Americans.
But ad experts say the wariness from prominent brands on far-right social networks, which have positioned themselves as free-speech alternatives to Silicon Valley giants like Meta and Google, is driven by the kinds of conspiracy theories and hyperpartisan politics often found on the sites.
In addition, they say, Truth Social has a relatively small user base and many older users, who are less desirable for the brands. Marketers have complained that Truth Social's ad-serving technology, run by Rumble, a right-wing video streaming website, offers limited tools for tracking an ad's performance or for showing ads to users based on their demographic profiles. Those tools, now standard among larger ad networks operated by Google and Meta, are vital for determining an ad's success.
"The more you stray from that safe center, the more you become the fringe or the extreme on anything, then the less money you're going to get," said Tom Denford, the chief executive of ID Comms, an advertising consulting firm.
Truth Social and Trump Media & Technology Group did not respond to requests for comment.
Companies can typically use tools offered by digital ad services to prevent their ads from appearing near words or phrases that might upset customers -- like war, assault or suicide. In a reflection of the wariness that brands have over Mr. Trump and his politics, the word "Trump" ranked as the 11th most common blacklisted term provided by advertisers in 2019, according to data from Integral Ad Science, a company focusing on brand safety.
"It's really dangerous for major advertisers to be closely associated with a political figure and also a political movement," said Bob Hoffman, an advertising industry veteran and the author of The Ad Contrarian, a newsletter critical of the industry. "It's not in their best interest to get involved in that quagmire."
Similar challenges faced Twitter after Elon Musk bought the company and said he would create a more permissive environment for free speech. Advertisers fled that platform or paused their campaigns in response, causing a significant drop in revenue.
"They pulled off Twitter because they are not sure that Twitter can fulfill their brand safety guidelines, and they will stay off until they are reassured," Mr. Denford said.
Mr. Musk also welcomed Mr. Trump back on Twitter, reinstating his account in November. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, announced this week that it would reinstate the president's accounts after he was barred in 2021 from the social media services, which said Mr. Trump's posts ran the risk of inciting more violence after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
Mr. Trump is obligated to make his posts available exclusively on Truth Social for six hours, and he has not posted to other social networks since Truth launched. That deal expires in June but can be renewed.
Rumble, the video streamer that manages ads for Truth Social, earns $ 15 million to $ 25 million annually, according to estimates from Similarweb, a company that analyzes websites. Rumble did not respond to requests for comment.
When ads launched on Truth last year using Rumble's platform, marketers complained that it offered limited ways to target ads to people based on their demographics -- like age, gender or interests. It also offered no way to track whether the ad resulted in a sale, a feature coveted by advertisers and offered by large ad networks like Google.
Maxwell Finn, an online marketer, said in a YouTube video that he was one of Truth Social's top advertisers, spending more than $ 150,000 on ads, including those for Trump-themed hats, shirts, coins and novelty bills.
In the video, he called the ad platform "frustrating" and "bare bones," adding that it lacked even basic functionality, forcing his company to manually track ad performance -- a method that would prove impossible for advertisers with larger budgets.
"Do I think this is a platform where you can be spending tens of thousands of dollars a day, especially if you only have a few products?" he said in another video. "No, probably. The audience is just too small."
Over time, the low-quality ads on Truth Social have irritated its own users, who have complained to Mr. Trump after repeatedly seeing the same disturbing images or after falling for misleading gimmicks.
"Can you not vet the ads on Truth?" asked one user in a post directed at Mr. Trump. "I've been scammed more than once."

Two Britons Went Off to the Front Lines. Neither Came Back.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Andrew Bagshaw, 47, and Chris Parry, 28, were part of an ad hoc cohort of foreigners who have gone to Ukraine despite little to no experience with combat situations.
Two British citizens, Andrew Bagshaw and Chris Parry, departed from the city of Kramatorsk at 8 a.m. on Jan. 6 and headed east toward the front lines of Ukraine's war with Russia, Ukrainian police said.
Their mission, according to an aid worker familiar with the matter, was to evacuate an elderly woman in Soledar, a small town where Russian and Ukrainian forces were waging a vicious fight.
They never returned.
Questions lingered about their fate until Tuesday, when Mr. Parry's family confirmed in a statement released through the British foreign ministry that "our beloved Chrissy" and Mr. Bagshaw had been killed "whilst attempting a humanitarian evacuation from Soledar."
"His selfless determination in helping the old, young and disadvantaged there has made us and his larger family extremely proud," the statement said.
The men's vehicle is believed to have been hit by an artillery shell, though investigations were underway, Mr. Bagshaw's parents said at a news conference. They had feared such an outcome, they said, but were "very, very proud" of his work.
Mr. Bagshaw, 47, and Mr. Parry, 28, were part of an ad hoc cohort of foreigners with little to no combat experience who helped evacuate civilians from the front lines, acquaintances said. Several of Mr. Parry's and Mr. Bagshaw's evacuations were documented by journalists, including Arnaud De Decker, who shared footage of Mr. Parry in Bakhmut days before he went missing.
Their deaths were a stark reminder of the danger facing those whose work has become a lifeline in the Donbas, where many Ukrainians are trapped in some of the worst war zones Europe has seen since the Second World War.
On Jan. 6, the two men "went to some really dangerous address," said Grzegorz Rybak, a fellow foreign volunteer who worked with both men and lived with Mr. Bagshaw in Kramatorsk for two weeks. "And they did not come back."
PMC Wagner, a notorious mercenary group fighting on behalf of Russia, claimed a week after their disappearance to have found one of the men's bodies. The group posted photos on Telegram of what appeared to be their passports, along with a certificate identifying Mr. Parry as a volunteer with the Pavlo Vyshniakov Foundation, a Kyiv-based charity that sends resources including food and medical supplies to civilians, hospitals and military groups. The foundation declined to comment.
Wagner's claim could not be verified at the time, and Russian state media has since claimed, without evidence, that the men were mercenaries.
The war in Ukraine is a humanitarian quandary. Conditions in some areas are too perilous for residents to stay put, or for many international organizations to allow their staff to venture in, said Abby Stoddard, a humanitarian policy analyst.
So some of the riskiest evacuations are being carried out by independent volunteers -- "in other words, the ones who have the least amount of resources to keep people safe," Ms. Stoddard said.
Bryan Stern, a U.S. veteran who co-founded a humanitarian rescue operation, described front line evacuation efforts in Ukraine as a "free-for-all." While foreign volunteers came to Ukraine with good intentions, he said, most have "no idea what they're doing."
"This is really why this is a sad story," he said.
Mr. Parry was a software engineer who wanted to travel the world, his family said.
In early January, he told the local BBC station in Cornwall, where he grew up, that he "knew nothing" about Ukraine before the invasion but "became obsessed" with helping. He intended to enlist with foreign fighters, but, having no combat experience, instead bought a van and began working as an evacuation driver last March.
In an Instagram post made days after his arrival, Mr. Parry wrote that he felt apprehensive about a planned journey to Kharkiv because "everyone I have spoken to about it believes there's a very strong chance of me dying."
Mr. Bagshaw was a British genetics researcher who was between jobs last spring in Christchurch, New Zealand, when he decided to go to Ukraine, a photojournalist who met him wrote in the New Zealand Herald in October. His family told reporters that he believed "it to be the morally right thing to do."
Mr. Rybak, who translated for the volunteers, said their ad hoc operation was largely carried out by a small community of English-speakers in Kramatorsk. Neither Mr. Parry nor Mr. Bagshaw spoke Ukrainian or Russian, he said.
Mr. Rybak said Ukrainians would contact local aid workers about relatives near Bakhmut, and their addresses would be relayed to the volunteers, who would drive into the conflict zone to evacuate them, often in donated or crowd-funded vehicles. The trips were unpredictable, Mr. Rybak said, with addresses sometimes vacant or residents resisting evacuation.
The men had plans for after the war. Mr. Parry had a partner he wanted to marry, Mr. Rybak recalled, and Mr. Bagshaw wanted to carry on with his scientific career.
"They wanted to live," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Frances Tiafoe may have lost his shot at winning the Australian Open, but his swirly "himbo" look won him fashion points. (Anna Wintour approves.)
On Monday, the girlfriend of the American tennis player Frances Tiafoe posted a video from what she called a "fashion show." In it, Mr. Tiafoe, ranked 17th in the world, tried on a kit sent to him by Nike, his sponsor, as he readied for the Australian Open.
"It's definitely a lot, but I'm here for it," his girlfriend, Ayan Broomfield, a tennis player from Canada, says as Mr. Tiafoe walks to a mirror to see the outfit: a sleeveless top and shorts covered in multicolored waves, like an oil slick rainbow or a lava lamp. (According to Nike, the pattern was inspired by Australia's terrain.)
"Nah, that's dope," says Mr. Tiafoe, who is wearing sneakers with a cherry blossom design. Ms. Broomfield laughs.
She shared the video on Twitter the day after Mr. Tiafoe debuted the outfit on the court, as a sort of tongue-in-cheek mea culpa in response to some spirited reactions from fans and commentators. "I absolutely loved it on him," Ms. Broomfield wrote, "so y'all can blame me." (She also credited Naomi Osaka for his sneakers.)
Mr. Tiafoe wore the kaleidoscopic set during the tournament, including on Friday, when he lost his third-round match. Though that ended his bid for the Australian title, the style points he earned with the kit aren't so easily revoked.
With a silhouette that evoked a 1920s bathing suit, the outfit, from a distance, at first resembled a one-piece to fans. The tennis publication Racquet called it "the Big Faux Romper," nodding to Mr. Tiafoe's nickname, "Big Foe," which he wears spelled out on a necklace. The look, the publication tweeted, "invites you to reject thought and embrace only good vibes. Perfect Aussie summer himbo energy."
This is the kind of message he can surely get behind. Mr. Tiafoe, 25, raised in the era of sports memes, represents a new kind of tennis star -- at least compared with the generation of intense, stately household-name players who rank above him, like Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Recently, for example, Mr. Tiafoe tried to pull down the pants of another American player during an interview.
He's goofy. He's outspoken. And he understands that people like to have opinions about fashion on the internet, writing about his Nike kit on Instagram: "what we think bout the fit ... I ain't mad at it."
But his good humor is largely why the look stood out -- even among other Nike-sponsored players wearing the same pattern on their shorts or skirts. (None, though, wore the exact matching set cabana-style as Mr. Tiafoe did.) His approach to the game is flamboyant, fueled by the energy of his audience, said the Racquet co-founder Caitlin Thompson, and so a flamboyant kit suits him.
"Not a lot of these guys actually like to be flamboyant," said Ms. Thompson, who suggested other Australian Open players wearing Nike look more like they're wearing costumes, against their will, "cowed into submission."
"He's not only such a goofball, but he seems like a very secure person, and I think that's why he's pulling it off," she said. "It feels like he's wearing it, not it's wearing him." (Also, she added, the tank top "shows off his guns.")
The fashion industry establishment has noticed Mr. Tiafoe, too. In September, shortly after he became the first American man in 16 years to reach the U.S. Open semifinals -- where his square-neck pink Nike shirt served as a warm-up to this year's even more colorful Australian Open kit -- he was seen sitting in the front row of Tom Ford's spring 2023 show, sandwiched between Russell Westbrook and Ciara.
On the other side of Ciara was Anna Wintour, a noted tennis enthusiast who has recruited three players as her co-chairs of the Met Gala: Serena Williams, in 2019; Naomi Osaka, in 2021; and Roger Federer, who was just announced as a chair of this year's gala. The shirt and shorts that Frances Tiafoe wore during the Australian Open drew spirited reactions. (PHOTOGRAPH BY KELLY DEFINA/GETTY IMAGES) This article appeared in print on page D3.

The Heart Motif Will Go On: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Either way, you can't escape them.
Don't search for heart-shaped rings on the internet. It leads you to a series of failed celebrity romances and presumably to a trail of tears: Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale, Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill.
As a design element, the heart is more like dots or stripes than it is a visual shorthand for romantic love. If you want romance, try lace or oysters or dead-stock midcentury Valentine's Day cards or inside jokes engraved on the back of a Swiss-made watch.
Hearts can feel bold and fresh: Think the boxy black Supreme shirt with red heart prints that Timothée Chalamet wore on a late-night talk show several years ago. (If that fact excites you, follow @readytimmywear on Instagram.) Another way to wear your heart on your sleeve would be a Nirvana "Heart-Shaped Box" allover print tee, recently going for four digits on Etsy.
To add just a little heart to your life, try a Deborah Pagani heart-shaped hair pin for Gucci Westman or a Blumarine belt with a heart-shaped buckle. Loewe has sunglasses with heart-shaped lenses, and like everything Jonathan Anderson designs, they're surreal enough that you can feel safe that no one will mistake you for paying homage to Kubrick's "Lolita." You might try to track down some of Chanel's chunkier costume jewelry with hearts. On the RealReal, you can find things like a red Chanel blouse with a black bow and a quilted heart from the Karl Lagerfeld years.
Even if you don't celebrate Valentine's Day, here are some hearts for the romantics and pragmatists alike.
Tiffany & Company
Hearts can lean a little bit cutesy, even skewing twee. If you'd rather die alone than give someone a candy heart, or are the kind of person who hates anything sweet (literal or figurative), try this jade pendant with an 18-karat gold mesh chain from the Elsa Peretti Open Heart collection for Tiffany. It's sexy and just a tad louche. The fresh green of the jade contrasts so well with the slinky 28-inch chain. Wear it with a beat-up vintage denim shirt buttoned so low even Bernard-Henri Lévy would blush. ( $ 4,900)
Alaïa
Remember when Rihanna wore that Yves Saint Laurent heart-shaped fur in 2016? Or maybe you bought the Erin Fetherston for Target heart-shaped bag in 2007? I was just doing some shopping reconnaissance and came across Alaïa's Le Cœur bag. It's small enough not to look gimmicky, but large enough to actually carry necessities. The shade of red is the right balance of cool and warm. Or you might consider a less obvious gold or blue one that comes on a gold chain. (from $ 1,170)
Yves Saint Laurent
No one understood the use of hearts as a design tool like Yves Saint Laurent, who drew them a little asymmetrical and off kilter. Re-See, the Paris-based designer resale site, has the best selection around, particularly the jewelry Robert Goossens designed for YSL. While you're browsing, there's a gold heart brooch with "Yves Saint Laurent" printed on it in script -- brooches are about to get big again -- that would look great on a man. But the coolest present would be a poster from 1989, said to be "from the private collection of one of Saint Laurent's most loyal collaborators." Bonus: It's framed. (2,100 euros, or about $ 2,300)
Stephen Dweck
Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country, who knows a lot about jewelry, said she was "a heart-jewelry skeptic for years" but is now drawn to them, pointing to lines like Foundrae and Briony Raymond. In that same vein, the jeweler Stephen Dweck, who used to design for Geoffrey Beene, makes the most decadent pair of earrings. You know when people ask you what your love language is? Here's mine: "Pink Tourmaline, Conch Shell and Diamond Earrings in 18K Gold." ( $ 28,865)
Paco Rabanne
A hood made of linked metal hearts looks like something you'd see in the armor section of the Met, but also like something the model Pat Cleveland would have worn to a club in the 1970s. (€650, or about $ 700)
Mondo Mondo
Hearts were big in the late 1980s, with bold, unapologetically big jewelry from Christian Lacroix or Chanel or Yves Saint Laurent. Natasha Ghosn, the designer of the Los Angeles jewelry-fragrance-candle line Mondo Mondo, may be the real heir to that aesthetic. So it's not surprising that she has a lot of heart motifs. This necklace looks like a piece of jewelry a scorned woman in a Jackie Collins novel would have ripped off her neck and thrown out a window after being betrayed by her man. It comes in silver and gold plate, but the silver feels a little less obvious and little more tender. ( $ 250)

Sad Ending in Italy for a Beloved Junk-Food Giant: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The 3-year-old rare Apennine brown bear was killed Monday night. He had become a celebrity because of his forays into human habitats.
ROME -- Throughout his short life, the brown bear known as Juan Carrito always made headlines.
He was famous in Italy in part for being an Apennine brown bear, a critically endangered subspecies that lives in the Apennine Mountains, in an area straddling the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions.
But he was also a personality -- or at least a bear whose gluttonous excursions into human territory brought him celebrity among many Italians, and who was held up as a warning by wildlife advocates. He was mourned after his death in a car accident on Monday.
By the time he was 2, Juan Carrito had become a social media star for his daring forays into the centers of ski resorts and mountain villages, where he foraged for food and rummaged through trash cans and dumpsters.
"He was an exuberant animal -- I used to compare him to a sort of James Dean of bears, beautiful and damned," said Luciano Sammarone, the director of the National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise, one of the areas where the rare bears reside.
"He spent his entire life in the spotlight," he added, describing Juan Carrito as a sort of "ambassador for the Apennine brown bear" that increased awareness.
The bear grew bolder with age, making international headlines in November 2021 after breaking into a bakery in the mountain town of Roccaraso, stuffing his face with cakes and pastries and trashing the place.
"He was food-conditioned," said Marco Antonelli, a biologist and expert on large carnivores for WWF Italy. "The only way to resolve this is to educate people not to feed wild animals" and to make sure that food is dumped in bear-proof containers.
Forest rangers captured Juan Carrito twice and took him into the wild to be re-acclimated away from humans. It was for his own good, officials said at the time, noting the unhealthy effects of eating trash -- everything from leftover pizza to plastic -- and the potential danger to people and the bear.
"Many thought of Carrito as a sort of Winnie the Pooh, a teddy bear, but that's just wrong," Mr. Sammarone said. "Wild animals have nature to feed off of. We can't alter or manipulate the rhythms of nature."
Juan Carrito's mother, Amarena, had been notorious in her own right as a food-conditioned bear. (She also gained some fame for giving birth in January 2020 to four cubs, a record for Apennine brown bears, according to Mr. Antonelli.)
The first time Juan Carrito was released into the wild, in December 2021, he spent a week in the forest before venturing back into an inhabited area. He was captured again months later and placed in a bear reserve, in the hopes that he would develop a taste for more appropriate natural food: berries, insects, carcasses, honey.
This time, he lasted three weeks in the wilderness before the lure of junk food brought him back into human habitats. The Italian news media breathlessly tracked his movements, relishing the rebellious bear, while forest rangers tracked him via a radio collar, hoping he would remain safe and far away.
"It was difficult because once a bear has learned how to find easy food, it goes back," Mr. Antonelli said. "It's like humans being shown a buffet and told they can eat for free."
The fact that Juan Carrito was still roaming the Apennines in January, rather than hibernating as bears should, was because he was looking for food in villages, he said: "That was anomalous."
The bear's scientific name was M20, but he was named Juan Carrito for the tiny town where he did some of his first incursions, and Juan is the Spanish version of Giovanni, for Giovanni Cannata, president of the National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise.
Juan Carrito became a mascot of sorts of the Abruzzo region. When he broke into a beehive last September, the beekeeper joked that the bear loved his products. Last month, a local Michelin-starred chef, Niko Romito, caught the bear roaming around near his three-star restaurant. He posted on Instagram that the bear had gone straight for the kitchen.
A consortium of ski resorts in Roccaraso put on a brave face because of the lack of snow in the area this month, posting a photo of Juan Carrito walking on barren ground and saying that, yes, the snow was missing, but at least he'd come.
An encounter with humans ultimately proved fatal for the bear. He was hit by a car on a road between Roccaraso and Castel di Sangro.
"As there are only 60 examples of this rare brown bear, the death of even one individual is serious," said Mr. Antonelli, adding that traffic accidents were the most significant cause of deaths for the Apennine brown bear, because the area in which they live is near highways and roads that are not adequately safeguarded.
The road on which the bear was killed was "sadly famous" he said; another bear was killed on the same tract in 2019.
Italians mourned Juan Carrito's death. The Rome newspaper Il Messaggero blazoned a large photograph on its front page: "Goodbye to Carrito, the 'city' bear killed by a car," read the headline. Hundreds of Italians paid their last respects on social media.
If there was any consolation at all, Mr. Sammarone said, "Carrito died as a free bear," having been allowed to live in the wild, rather than cooped up in a reserve. "The challenge is to learn from this," he said, "otherwise his death will have been useless."

An Alcohol-Free Month? Not Everyone's Thrilled.: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Between the "tripledemic," the economy, holiday fatigue and the temporarily sober, businesses are suffering.
Yahaira Gil Maestro, a craft beer bar owner in New York City, supports the wellness goals of her customers."We know people want to start healthier habits, and we respect that," she said.
But as a business owner, she feels a bit more conflicted about Dry January, the voluntary month of sobriety that has become trendy in recent years.
Because so many of her customers stop drinking at the same time, the month is a collective financial drain for her. It also comes at a time when business is already slow because of cold weather and holiday fatigue.
"I'm willing to advocate for a dry June. Our business can better take the hit then," she said, laughing. "Or maybe people can take turns stopping to drink?"
She is an owner of BierWax, a bar known for its vinyl collection that has locations in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, and Ridgewood, Queens, the latter of which opened less than a year ago. There, business has been so slow that Ms. Gil Maestro has had to let go of one bartender and reduce the hours of another, and to close on Mondays and Tuesdays this month.
Ms. Gil Maestro is also seeing less foot traffic at her Brooklyn location. Though it is still too early to know January sales numbers, she believes that they will be worse than last January, when revenue at her Brooklyn location plummeted by 17 percent.
According to Morning Consult, a data research company, 15 percent of American adults planned to participate in Dry January this year. While those temporarily going sober have great intentions -- they are often looking after their health, their finances or both -- the economic ramifications can loom large for small businesses across the city.
"People just don't think about what it can do to a business," Ms. Gil Maestro said. "Even a few thousands of dollars can have a very large impact." It can determine whether owners can make rent and pay their employees, she said.
While New York City bars have contended with Dry January for years, they are also continuing to navigate the fallout from the pandemic. Last year, Omicron was raging in January. Bars closed because of outbreaks among workers, and so many people were sick -- or scared of getting sick -- that they stayed home, sober or not.
And this year, an ongoing "tripledemic" (flu, Covid, RSV), along with economic uncertainty for many, continues to pose challenges for New York's usually robust nightlife scene. Morning Consult found that 73 percent of those embracing Dry January were forgoing alcohol to save money.
"There is always a slight seasonal downturn in January, but the situation has definitely been more fraught at this moment in time," said Zack Kinney, a founder of Kings County Brewers Collective, a brewery in Bushwick, Brooklyn. "There is still Covid, inflation is higher, people are more sensitive about spending money, all those things are contributing to the tight squeeze on top of Dry January."
Mr. Kinney estimated that beer sales were down 15 to 20 percent so far this month.
Instead of replacing two employees who left the brewery in recent weeks, he has asked other workers to fill in the gaps."We are asking people to switch hats and do other roles including working on our delivery team or the packaging team," he said. "It's giving us a little bit of wiggle room."
He is also finding other countries to export his beer, shipping it to China for the Chinese New Year and to Chile, where it is currently summer. "We are trying to find the opportunity somewhere in the globe where there isn't a seasonal downshift right now," he said.
At Interboro Spirits and Ales, a brewery and distillery in East Brooklyn, business has been slower "even than other Januaries," said the owner, Laura Dierks.
Her business is taking a hit because her clients -- other bars and restaurants across the city who buy her beer -- are struggling. "If you don't do well in the fall, and you haven't been able to save enough money to pay your rent in January, then you're in trouble," Ms. Dierks said.
But Interboro is pivoting to reflect the demand; it is one of the city's many businesses offering nonalcoholic beverages to appeal to a wider population, especially this month. "We did a test keg last month," Ms. Dierks said. "People liked it, so we are going to do more."
At the beginning of January, The Cobra Club, a karaoke bar in Bushwick, posted its nonalcoholic menu -- the selection includes items like Bud Zero and virgin frozen margaritas -- on Instagram with the caption, "If you are participating in sober January but still want to have a social life, play pool, go to comedy shows and karaoke we got you covered!"
Liquor stores do not have this option, said Anetta Klencner, the owner of Roebling Liquors, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "Liquor stores in New York State cannot sell nonalcoholic beverages," she said. "We are very limited by this strict law, and there is no way we can compete."
She estimated that sales at her store were down by 10 percent so far this month, a loss she has tried to make up for by selling wine to event planners who organize weddings and corporate events. "Individuals may be doing dry January, but the world moves on, and special events are not going dry," she said.
Ms. Klencner said she did not care for the arbitrary rules of Dry January.
"There is always a moment in your life when you can have a cocktail or stop having a cocktail," she said. "It doesn't have to be dictated by certain months."
But Gary Clegg, a restaurant owner in East Harlem, appreciates Dry January, and he is committed to it himself. His solution? To close his New American spot, Alison, for the first two weeks in January -- a slow time anyway, he said.
"January is a good time to reset," he said. "It's good for us to have this break so we can also focus on our healthy habits."
But for those people in the industry who remain frustrated with the month, Katie Kennedy, the head bartender at Contento, a Peruvian restaurant in Harlem, has some good news: Not everyone is staying 100 percent loyal to Dry January.
"There were two people at the bar the other day who sat next to each other and both said they were doing Dry January," she said. "They ended up ordering wine."

Even the loss of a few thousand dollars in sales can have a large impact on a business, said Yahaira Gil Maestro, right, an owner of BierWax.

Full text: Peruvian roast chicken, tofu-ginger stir-fry and more recipes.
Good morning. When my children were very small, there wasn't a lot of time to cook proper meals. Each evening my wife and I found ourselves sliding down a chute that led from dinner for the kids to bath to books to bedtime, and emerging at the bottom ready only for takeout food and some shut-eye before, invariably, one child or both awakened in a cry.
We ate a lot of takeout Peruvian roast chicken. It was our staple meal: salty-skinned and moist, with an addictive spicy cilantro sauce. That phase of our lives didn't last that long in the grand scheme of things, but I still seek comfort in those flavors, and remember those days with warmth.
And now I can cook the chicken myself with Melissa Clark's ace recipe (above). I usually double the amount of sauce so I can use it to anoint chicken sandwiches during the week. Would you consider joining me in doing so today?
As for the rest of the week ...
Monday
Hetty McKinnon has a new recipe for a tofu-ginger stir-fry that's an excellent fast-and-flavorful meal for the start of the week. The slivered ginger sweetens in the pan, while the tofu achieves the miracle of being both bouncy and crisp.
Tuesday
There's something deliciously heretical about Kay Chun's smoky tomato carbonara, which brings a bright tang to what is usually a velvety rich dish. "I don't care what you call it," one subscriber noted on the recipe, "this tastes great."
Wednesday
Ali Slagle's sheet-pan roasted chicken with greens is a reminder of the ease and joy of one-pan cooking, with dark, leafy greens beneath the chicken absorbing its fat and juices so that they emerge almost braised.
Thursday
Here's a 30-minute salmon and couscous salad with cucumber-feta dressing from Yasmin Fahr, inspired by both green goddess dressing and mast-o khiar, a Persian side dish of cucumbers and yogurt. (Eat the leftovers cold for lunch, enlivened by a squeeze of lime juice and more fresh herbs.)
Friday
And then to round out the week, join me for some kitchen freestyling with a no-recipe recipe approach to a kale salad with cranberries, pecans and blue cheese. When I made it the other night, I swapped in dried cherries, roasted almonds and dabs of triple crème Brie for the headliner mix-ins, and then topped the salad with a variation on Melissa Clark's recipe for chicken schnitzel. (I used chicken thighs in place of her cutlets.) This was an outrageously good meal.
Many thousands more recipes to cook this week are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking, along with additional inspiration on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Go forth and discover them!
You do need a subscription to read the recipes, however. Subscriptions are what make this whole enterprise possible. If you haven't already, please consider subscribing today. Thanks so much.
And write for help if you run into trouble along the way. We're at cookingcare@nytimes.com, and someone will get back to you. You can also write to me, if you'd like to say hello or bark: foodeditor@nytimes.com. Even if I can't respond, I read every letter I get.
Now, it's nothing to do with mulberries or goat, but the novelist Russell Banks died last Sunday at 82. That's reason enough for you to read -- or reread -- his 1985 novel, "Continental Drift."
My old colleague Alastair Macaulay is in The New York Review of Books this week with an accounting of a huge new biography of the dancer Bronislava Nijinska. If there's no way I'll read the book, I'm very happy I read the review.
David Zipper is in The Atlantic with a smart and counterintuitive take on American carmakers going all in on electricity, "Electric Vehicles Are Bringing Out the Worst in Us."
Finally, we need only five minutes to make you love Sun Ra. Read and listen to that, cook something delicious and have a very good week! (PHOTOGRAPHS BY BOBBI LIN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES.

Surf's Up, but Not Enough for the Eddie: [Sports Desk]

Author: Minsberg, Talya

Abstract: None available.

Full text: HALEIWA, Hawaii -- Last week, on Monday afternoon, Tikanui Smith, a big-wave surfer from Tahiti, received the call he had been waiting for all his life.
The Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational would be happening, finally, in less than 48 hours. The event, perhaps the world's most prestigious and elusive surfing competition, is open only to invitees and held only when the conditions are exactly right. The waves in Waimea Bay, on the North Shore of Oahu, must be consistently reaching heights exceeding 20 feet -- that is wave faces of 40 feet, about the size of a four-story building. Those conditions are rare, and even rarer to prevail long enough to host a full day of competition.
The last time the event was held was in 2016.
"When I got the news, I stopped talking, stopped laughing and got super serious," Smith said. "It's on, the dream is on."
The announcement, which arrived in a group message on Instagram, sent 40 invitees and 18 alternates scrambling. There were planes to catch, friends' couches to claim, and specialized big-wave surfboards and safety vests to pack. The exclusive list included surfers from South Africa, Portugal, France, Chile, Brazil and California, and from just a few miles up the road along the Kamehameha Highway.
If Smith, 31, was going to make it, he would need to hustle. He lives on the island of Moorea, and would need to get on a boat to the island of Tahiti, then in a cab to Faa'a International Airport, and then on the final flight of the day to Los Angeles before boarding another flight to Honolulu. That was the 20-hour travel plan that would have him arriving in time for the competition.
Jody Grosmaire, his brother and coach, dropped everything to join him. The two gathered passports and the necessary Covid-19-related papers, and began making what Smith called a "maybe once in a lifetime" journey.
By the time they landed in Los Angeles, they were hit with a flurry of messages. The event had been called off. The forecast had shifted just enough to upend the world of big-wave surfing. The swell was no longer expected to be large enough for the Eddie.
"Due to the wind conditions that are going to be prevailing in the early morning and due to the size of the swell in the early morning we are going to cancel the Eddie for Wednesday," Clyde Aikau, Eddie's brother, said in front of Waimea Bay the morning of Jan. 10, a Tuesday.
"We're looking forward, we're looking forward," he said in the same breath as the cancellation, knowing the heavy disappointment that had befallen traveling surfers. "We're looking for the 22nd, which is projected to be even a bigger swell with a lot more better waves."
Big-wave surfers know nature can be fickle, and even a team of forecasters can't predict an ever-evolving swell. But the electrifying rush of an event that is suddenly scheduled followed by the emotional crash of a cancellation is unique to the Eddie.
"It's been a big roller coaster," Smith said. "Maybe that's what makes it more special."
Like many big-wave surf competitions, the Eddie has a holding period that lasts for months. When weather models and buoy data detect a massive swell, big-wave surfers are told the contest is on, and a race to the waves begins. But most big-wave contests hold the event once it is called, even if conditions change after it has been greenlit.
The Eddie is distinct in its specificity, and described in a slogan: "The bay calls the day." If it's too windy, or if the waves are too small or too inconsistent, the contest is not held, even if the world's best surfers have all arrived and the beach is filled with spectators. On Feb. 10, 2016, the contest was called off the morning of the event because of a swell change. It was eventually held a few weeks later when a monster swell arrived, bringing waves topping 60 feet.
The event has been held since 1984 in honor of Eddie Aikau, a surfer from Hawaii and the first lifeguard on the North Shore of Oahu, home to some of the world's most famed and dangerous beaches. Aikau saved more than 500 people as a lifeguard, and became known as a surfer who would brave massive waves that no one else would attempt.
Aikau was already larger than life when he joined the crew of a voyaging canoe that was retracing the ancient Polynesian migration route between Hawaii and Tahiti in 1978. Within hours of setting sail, the vessel, Hokulea, capsized. After waiting for rescue, Aikau took his surfboard and paddled toward the Hawaiian island of Lanai for help. The rest of the crew was eventually rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard, but Aikau was never seen again.
The Eddie surf contest was founded six years later, and has been held only nine times since. An invitation to the opening ceremony -- whether or not the competition is held -- is a sign of respect and recognition from the Aikau family.
Isabelle Leonhardt, a big-wave surfer from Colima, Mexico, said being invited to the competition is "the biggest honor in the world." She was one of many surfers who traveled to Oahu for the Dec. 9 opening ceremony of the 2022-23 contest.
"In Hawaii, it stands for the history of big waves and surfers that come out to conquer these waves, just like Eddie," Leonhardt, 39, said. "The way he lived and what he did for others makes it way more special, because I feel like in this event you can give purpose to surfing."
Smith traveled to the opening ceremony too, just as he did when he was first invited in 2019. He was grinning as he greeted other big-wave surfers and hugged Clyde Aikau, who draped a lei around his neck. Those in attendance are offered traditional blessings and all paddle out to Waimea Bay for a ceremony.
"The first time I paddled out, I had tears in my eyes," Smith said, pointing to the goose bumps on his arms. "Maybe because I'm Tahitian -- we're Polynesian too -- for me it means way more than the surf competition. When you paddle out you feel that Eddie is coming to us."
Early in the morning on Jan. 11, when invitees had expected to be waiting for their heats, many still paddled out to meet the monster swell that was rolling through the North Shore. Crowds met them at the beach -- many locals had taken a sick day from work when the event was first announced -- and cheered as surfers dropped into powerful waves.
There was Koa Rothman studying the sets of waves rolling in and Eli Olson coming in after "riding some fun ones." Landon McNamara paddled out on a board that had an "Eddie Would Go" bumper sticker, a reminder, he said, "that keeps me going." Bianca Valenti was giddy to be "reacquainted with the waves," ones that only break this way once or twice a winter in a good year.
And there were Smith and Grosmaire, jubilant as they watched massive sets roll into the bay. When the event was canceled, they both decided to get on the next flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu anyway.
The same instinct brought Leonhardt to the bay, even if she was an alternate on the women's invitee list. Her journey began on Jan. 9 in the afternoon as she bounced between buses, taxis and flights from Colima to Guadalajara to Tijuana to San Diego to Honolulu.
One by one, they timed their entries into the dangerous shore break. And one by one, they returned to the sand, buzzing with the excitement that first brought them here.
The bay did not call the day after all. But the swell still arrived, so they did too.

Not Too Young to Sleuth: [Review]

Full text: This thriller, about a teenage girl whose mother disappears, plays out on a computer screen.
The gimmick behind "Missing," a strenuous techno-thriller about a teen girl named June (Storm Reid) who takes to the internet to track down her mother (Nia Long), is that the directors and screenwriters, Will Merrick and Nick Johnson, frame the action on computer screens. All of June's sleuthing is cloistered to apps which she opens in increasing panic. She's a web-weaned child who barely bothered to speak to her mom even before the parent's disappearance. Initially, June celebrates having the house to herself by Googling "How to throw a rager." Her friends dutifully post her drunkenness to Instagram so that we, the viewer, can witness it.
June's mother was last seen headed to Cartagena with her boyfriend (Ken Leung), a dork so drab that even his festive vacation shirts are drained of color. By the end of the first act, June and her best friend (Megan Suri) are scouring the man's Facebook for clues to hack his email password. (Maybe they should try RedH3rring $ .)
From there, the story emboldens itself from relatable online stalking to ludicrous plot twists, both of which Reid parries with confidence. When the film momentarily feigns to look like a film, the image zooms out to reveal that the handsome cinematography is really a true crime docuseries streaming on June's laptop. (In a meta-joke, the show is a glossy re-enactment of the producers' previous film, the 2018 mystery "Searching," which shared a near-identical premise.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Missing" captures the constant distractions of the modern age. Pop-up windows continually tug at June's attention. However, the film's more engaging moments tap into the older cyber nostalgia of text-based adventure games from the 1970s, where problems are solved by typing the right command: Enter cave. Brandish sword. Write "Can I see the security camera?" into on online English-Spanish translator while on the phone with your mother's hotel. It's not exactly riveting to watch June download and install WhatsApp so that she can video call Colombia. Yet, there's some pleasure in a brains-over-brawn quest that flatters us to fancy that we might be clever enough to solve it ourselves, despite giggles that arise when Julian Scherle's score swells so portentously for June's digital breakthroughs that you'd think Conan had smote an army. Even goofier is an emotional scene that builds to June pledging this teary promise to her vanished mother: "I'll stop making fun of you for using Siri for everything."
When June's quest goes viral, the investigation -- along with her role in her own narrative -- nearly slips out of her grasp. Too much connectivity can be a cancer, Merrick and Johnson seem to say, and most of us already agree. Yet, there's an oddly emotional sequence when June breaks into her mother's dating app and, for the first time, learns to see her as a woman with her own desires. Better still is a bit part by the actor Joaquim de Almeida as Javier, a gig worker in Cartagena -- "cleaning, electricity, you know" -- who June hires to do cheap on-location reconnaissance. Javier has only a two-and-a-half star rating, but he's so good that I spent the film hoping June would take a minute to write him a glowing review.

Re "I.R.S. Faces Big Backlogs as the G.O.P. Pushes Cuts" (Business, Jan. 12):
How ironic that just a few weeks after the release of Donald Trump's tax returns, which laid bare how easy it is for a wealthy individual to exploit the loopholes baked into the Internal Revenue Code, the G.O.P. has set out to undo the last Congress's effort to resuscitate the underfunded agency tasked with ensuring tax code compliance.
I earned my living teaching my wealthy clients how to legally utilize the numerous (and often ridiculous) rules and regulations that benefit the super-wealthy at the expense of the wage-earning Everyman.
The uproar over Mr. Trump's paying no income tax is misplaced. The uproar should be directed at Congress, which over the years has stuffed the Internal Revenue Code with scores of nonsensical "exceptions" to avoid taxation.
Mr. Trump may have (undoubtedly?) cheated on his taxes to exaggerate his losses, but the main culprits in the broader sense are not the wealthy taxpayers who follow the rules, but rather the code, which offers them the ammunition to do so.
And the G.O.P. is now determined to reduce the agency's ability to pursue cheats and to block necessary legislation to change the code.

To the Editor:
Republicans for years have argued that the government should be run more like a business, and that business leaders make good elected officials. Why then would they want to gut the equivalent of a company's accounts receivable department, the Internal Revenue Service? Doesn't sound like a good business move to me!

To the Editor:
What those in Washington, and particularly Republicans, fail to understand is that the I.R.S. does serve the majority of Americans.
I don't like to pay taxes, but when I consider the benefits I sigh and write the check. I also contemplate that my taxes would probably be a bit lower if everyone paid what they legally owe. And I haven't even mentioned the various sweetheart deals (carried interest) that should be eliminated.
Let's strengthen the I.R.S. so the majority of Americans can get a bit of a tax break.

China's Shrinking Population
To the Editor:
Re "Ominous Sign: Deaths Exceed Births in China" (front page, Jan. 18):
Could we stop seeing population reductions as disasters and instead as blessings for the fate of our overburdened planet?
Yes, there could be difficult times when smaller groups of working-age people will need to support economies with large groups of elderly people. Allowing immigration from countries with more able-bodied workers than jobs is an obvious mitigation. And of course machines and artificial intelligence are coming to take many jobs.
Fewer births will ultimately mean fewer elderly people. Countries (including ours) will need to get better at sharing societal wealth to properly and humanely support all lives. And when there are many fewer on this earth, it will be a major win for our very distressed environment.

Fighting Crowds to Enjoy the Art
To the Editor:
Re "The Louvre Limits Visitors by One-Third" (Arts, Jan. 7), about bottlenecks and surging crowds at the museum, to the detriment of the viewing experience:
Too often I have had to toil my way through crowds at a museum to get my turn in front of a canvas, only to feel a sharp elbow in my side, or the contact of a boot against my leg. Is this a museum or a mud-wrestling match?
Can we please ban the use of cellphones to take selfies in front of the art? Your glamorous self blocking half of Queen Elizabeth I's regalia or the entirety of van Gogh's haunted face is not what we come to a museum to look at.
Instead, museums should install an outdoor covered terrace with a rotating set of good reproductions and beautiful lighting that the Instagram preeners can use for their backgrounds.
Then museums might not have to limit the number of visitors.

To the Editor:
I recently fled the Louvre with my heart pounding. Never in my lifetime in New York City had I experienced such crowd-crushing terror.
Not only limiting the number of visitors but also moving the Mona Lisa to another site will restore the Louvre's contemplative atmosphere.

Nonbinary Work Clothes
To the Editor:
Re "New Dress Code: 100% Yourself and Loving It" (Thursday Styles, Jan. 12):
Thank you for highlighting the experiences of nonbinary professionals in the workplace. As an attorney with the A.C.L.U. Women's Rights Project, and as a nonbinary professional myself, I would like to respond to the assertion that "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has consistently been interpreted to permit different dress codes for men and women."
Gendered dress codes reflect and reinforce harmful and discriminatory gender stereotypes. They also frequently target workers from marginalized backgrounds with excessive policing of their appearance, including transgender and nonbinary people, women of color and women living in poverty.
Given these harms, gendered dress codes often run afoul of Title VII and other legal protections against discrimination in employment. Indeed, the A.C.L.U. is currently litigating a challenge on behalf of a nonbinary flight attendant against Alaska Airlines's gendered uniform policy that forces employees to conform to rigid and binary stereotypes about masculinity and femininity.
Gendered dress codes are harmful to all employees, and especially women and nonbinary people, and do not belong in the workplace.

Dress Codes for Missouri Politicians
To the Editor:
Re "Women in Missouri's Legislature Are Now Required to Wear a Blazer" (news article, Jan. 16):
The Missouri State House of Representatives now requires female legislators to wear a blazer or a cardigan when performing the state's legislative business. Male legislators are required to wear a jacket, shirt and tie. The reasons for these dress codes are that these outfits reflect a more serious, formal and professional mien and attitude.
Without thumbing through the pages of dress for success books, I can see why the clothing choices of those in the political arena may be perceived to be serious or not when it comes to their legislative duties. Legislators showing up in overalls, straw hats or psychedelic T-shirts probably don't instill confidence in their ability to do the people's work.
Although the correct style of dress required for the Missouri elected officials may give a presumption of serious intentions, it is no guarantee that they will be any smarter or more successful than if they wore straw hats and combat boots.
Missouri is often called the Show Me State, and I guess it is living up to that reputation.

It’s Dry January. Pour One Out for the Bar Owners.

NEW YORK — Yahaira Gil Maestro, a craft beer bar owner in New York City, supports the wellness goals of her customers.“We know people want to start healthier habits, and we respect that,” she said.
But as a business owner, she feels a bit more conflicted about Dry January, the voluntary month of sobriety that has become trendy in recent years.
Because so many of her customers stop drinking at the same time, the month is a collective financial drain for her. It also comes at a time when business is already slow because of cold weather and holiday fatigue.
“I’m willing to advocate for a dry June. Our business can better take the hit then,” she said, laughing. “Or maybe people can take turns stopping to drink?”
She is an owner of BierWax, a bar known for its vinyl collection that has locations in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, and Ridgewood, Queens, the latter of which opened less than a year ago. There, business has been so slow that Gil Maestro has had to let go of one bartender and reduce the hours of another, and to close on Mondays and Tuesdays this month.
Gil Maestro is also seeing less foot traffic at her Brooklyn location. Though it is still too early to know January sales numbers, she believes that they will be worse than last January, when revenue at her Brooklyn location plummeted 17%.
According to Morning Consult, a data research company, 15% of American adults planned to participate in Dry January this year. While those temporarily going sober have great intentions — they are often looking after their health, their finances or both — the economic ramifications can loom large for small businesses across the city.
“People just don’t think about what it can do to a business,” Gil Maestro said. “Even a few thousands of dollars can have a very large impact.” It can determine whether owners can make rent and pay their employees, she said.
While New York City bars have contended with Dry January for years, they are also continuing to navigate the fallout from the pandemic. Last year, omicron was raging in January. Bars closed because of outbreaks among workers, and so many people were sick — or scared of getting sick — that they stayed home, sober or not.
And this year, an ongoing “tripledemic” (flu; COVID-19; respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV), along with economic uncertainty for many, continues to pose challenges for New York’s usually robust nightlife scene. Morning Consult found that 73% of those embracing Dry January were forgoing alcohol to save money.
“There is always a slight seasonal downturn in January, but the situation has definitely been more fraught at this moment in time,” said Zack Kinney, a founder of Kings County Brewers Collective, a brewery in Bushwick, Brooklyn. “There is still COVID, inflation is higher, people are more sensitive about spending money, all those things are contributing to the tight squeeze on top of Dry January.”
Kinney estimated that beer sales were down 15% to 20% this month.
Instead of replacing two employees who left the brewery in recent weeks, he has asked other workers to fill in the gaps.“We are asking people to switch hats and do other roles including working on our delivery team or the packaging team,” he said. “It’s giving us a little bit of wiggle room.”
He is also finding other countries to export his beer, shipping it to China for the Chinese New Year and to Chile, where it is currently summer. “We are trying to find the opportunity somewhere in the globe where there isn’t a seasonal downshift right now,” he said.
At Interboro Spirits and Ales, a brewery and distillery in East Brooklyn, business has been slower “even than other Januaries,” said owner Laura Dierks.
Her business is taking a hit because her clients — other bars and restaurants across the city who buy her beer — are struggling. “If you don’t do well in the fall, and you haven’t been able to save enough money to pay your rent in January, then you’re in trouble,” Dierks said.
But Interboro is pivoting to reflect the demand. It is one of the city’s many businesses offering nonalcoholic beverages to appeal to a wider population, especially this month. “We did a test keg last month,” Dierks said. “People liked it, so we are going to do more.”
At the beginning of January, The Cobra Club, a karaoke bar in Bushwick, posted its nonalcoholic menu — the selection includes items such as Bud Zero and virgin frozen margaritas — on Instagram with the caption, “If you are participating in sober January but still want to have a social life, play pool, go to comedy shows and karaoke we got you covered!”
Liquor stores do not have this option, said Anetta Klencner, the owner of Roebling Liquors, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “Liquor stores in New York state cannot sell nonalcoholic beverages,” she said. “We are very limited by this strict law, and there is no way we can compete.”
She estimated that sales at her store were down 10% this month, a loss she has tried to make up for by selling wine to event planners who organize weddings and corporate events. “Individuals may be doing dry January, but the world moves on, and special events are not going dry,” she said.
Klencner said she did not care for the arbitrary rules of Dry January.
“There is always a moment in your life when you can have a cocktail or stop having a cocktail,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be dictated by certain months.”
But Gary Clegg, a restaurant owner in East Harlem, appreciates Dry January, and he is committed to it himself. His solution? To close his New American spot, Alison, for the first two weeks in January — a slow time anyway, he said.
“January is a good time to reset,” he said. “It’s good for us to have this break so we can also focus on our healthy habits.”
But for those people in the industry who remain frustrated with the month, Katie Kennedy, the head bartender at Contento, a Peruvian restaurant in Harlem, has some good news: Not everyone is staying 100% loyal to Dry January.
“There were two people at the bar the other day who sat next to each other and both said they were doing Dry January,” she said. “They ended up ordering wine.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Defense Minister in Germany, a Frequent Target of Criticism, Abruptly Resigns: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The minister was repeatedly attacked over public blunders and her handling of the war in Ukraine. She is the most senior member of Olaf Scholz's government to resign.
BERLIN -- Germany's defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, has resigned after enduring a year of heavy criticism over repeated public blunders, her response to the Ukraine war and her government's slow rollout of a military buildup.
Ms. Lambrecht is the highest-ranking member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government to resign, and her departure is likely to be seen as a blow to his reputation. The chancellor had repeatedly defended the record of Ms. Lambrecht, a former justice minister and a fellow member of his party, the Social Democrats.

"The monthslong media focus on me as a person hardly allows for objective reporting and discussion about the servicemen and women, the German armed forces and security policy decisions in the interest of the citizens of Germany," Ms. Lambrecht said in a statement released on Monday morning.
Since taking up the post when Mr. Scholz's government entered office last year, Ms. Lambrecht had been dogged by criticism. She had no previous experience of the military and opposition leaders accused her of lacking interest in heading the Defense Ministry. According to Germany's best-selling daily, Bild, Ms. Lambrecht had been unable to name the different ranks of the German military in an interview with the paper.
Ms. Lambrecht began facing public scorn at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As Germany debated sending weapons to Kyiv in the early days of the invasion, Ms. Lambrecht trumpeted a delivery of 5,000 helmets. She was the face of the government's repeated foot-dragging over sending weapons, though it is likely she was carrying out a policy largely driven by the chancellery.
Criticism ramped up last summer when it emerged that Ms. Lambrecht had used a government helicopter to take her son on a family vacation.
More recently, opposition parties in Germany have argued Ms. Lambrecht is responsible for the slow rollout of a 100 billion euro ( $ 108 billion) defense fund, part of a plan by the government to significantly bolster its military in response to the war in Ukraine. Germany's limited stores of basic ammunition mean it has stocks for only hours or days of combat.
The final straw appears to have been an awkward video released on New Year's Eve on Ms. Lambrecht's personal Instagram account. In it, Ms. Lambrecht discussed the war in Ukraine and offered seasonal greetings amid a raucous backdrop of fireworks in Berlin. Critics called it distasteful, and even her own ministry distanced itself from the video, saying it was a personal statement.
In her statement, Ms. Lambrecht said that she hoped her resignation would put the public focus back where it belonged. "The valuable work of the soldiers and the many motivated people in the area of operations must be in the foreground," she said.
A successor has not been announced. This article appeared in print on page A9.

For Star-Crossed Lovers, Wherefore the Intensity?: [Review]

Full text: Septime Webre's rendition of the tragic tale for Hong Kong Ballet this weekend at New York City Center had a striking look, but its dancing lacked vulnerability.
In Hong Kong Ballet's version of "Romeo and Juliet," a little time travel is necessary. Shakespeare's tale is set, not in Renaissance Italy, but in 1960s Hong Kong -- an era of economic development, of a rising younger generation and of cinema. Hong Kong's movie culture makes a cameo in this "Romeo," in which you see, milling around the marketplace, tourists, office workers and a film crew hard at work.
The vaudevillian scene performed as part of that shoot seems incongruous, but there you have it: In this ballet, it's the small, odd details that stand out. What is absent in the big picture, unfortunately, is vulnerability. Romeo and Juliet lock eyes. They embrace. But there's little actual feeling.
For the first half of the production, choreographed by the company's artistic director, Septime Webre (formerly of the Washington Ballet), and performed at New York City Center over the weekend, many members of the audience became amateur filmmakers themselves. It's true that the colorful show had obvious Instagram appeal, but when a woman held her smartphone high above her head to better shoot the ballroom scene, flash on, the experience started to veer into surreal.
As for the ballet itself? Despite its new setting, this "Romeo" was more ponderous and rushed -- yes, both! -- than groundbreaking or romantic. Several names of characters have been changed: Tybalt is Tai Po (Garry Corpuz), a triad boss who is Lord Capulet's associate and, no doubt about it, Lady Capulet's lover, while the lively Mercutio is Little Mak (Leung Chunlong). Silly and vivacious, he is always quick to bestow a kiss -- especially on Tai Po. The premise seems to be that Mak wants to embarrass Tai Po, slick and sinister in black leather, in public, but Mak seems to have a thing for Romeo, too. His last move, after he is stabbed by Tai Po, is to swoon slowly backward into Romeo's arms and kiss him with a dying man's gusto.
Even with shifts in characterization, the story remains pretty much the same. Romeo and Juliet come from rival families, they fall in love and they die. The main departure in Webre's "Romeo" has to do, not just with its sometimes swinging '60s look, but its fight scenes, which draw on Hong Kong-style kung fu. (The martial arts adviser is Hing Chao.) There are weapons -- sticks and butterfly knives -- along with physical combat: darting side kicks give way to anemic, theatrical punches.
The design is more absorbing. The set, by Ricky Chan, is alight with neon signs advertising teahouses and nightclubs, and the costumes, by Mandy Tam, are impeccably cut and a mix of sleek 1960s garb and traditional clothing. With patterns and color, slits and collars, Tam's costumes are the most vibrant and intricate part of the show and often do a better job of telling the story than the choreography does.
Romeo's world is joyful, ebullient, a land of happy purples and greens, while Juliet's is largely red and black -- harsh, oppressive, dangerous. When Romeo, Mak and Benny (Jonathan Spigner as Webre's Benvolio) burst into the scene of a gala dinner, the moment Romeo meets Juliet, it's as if three preppies got lost on their way to the country club and ended up in Dracula's castle.
On Friday, as Juliet, Ye Feifei was refined yet often too grown up, too distant; Alejandro Virelles, a principal guest artist as Romeo, seemed distracted by Romeo's choreographic palette, which featured a hectic array of lifts. By the time he made it to the crypt scene, his exhaustion, you sensed, was real.
But most jarring was the way their dancing was strung together with pauses -- tiny moments to acknowledge the audience, which continued with others as well. It broke the magic. "Romeo and Juliet" calls for an intimacy so intense that it's like we, in the crowd, are peeking through the smallest crack of a door. We know what's going to happen but we can't help ourselves: We can't look away.
In this production, occasions for intimacy were continually broken. Why would Romeo turn to pick up his coat before Juliet climbed the balcony stairs? Wouldn't he want to gaze at her as long as he could? The staircase, with steps on either side -- affixed in front with crisscrossing pieces of bamboo, like scaffolding -- seemed treacherous enough. During her ascent, a masked stagehand could be seen helping her up. The ballet was a tight fit, much too large for City Center's stage, and in certain instances, the action in the wings inevitably trickled onto the stage.
Crowded scenes turned into a melee, while the more intimate moments, like when the lovers were alone onstage, turned comical -- Romeo would look for Juliet, and Juliet would look for Romeo as they used make-believe blinders while racing across the stage to pause, staring dreamily into corners with imploring arms. It was hard to find flow in the dancing itself, which seemed to prize poses and, always, extension over continuous movement. Hong Kong Ballet had energy, but as for texture? That was left to the costumes.

Dnipro Mourns As Dozens Die In Russia Strike: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rescue workers were still digging through the ruins of a residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Sunday, a day after a Russian missile attack.
More than 24 hours after a heavy-duty missile built to sink ships exploded in a dense Ukrainian cityscape of homes and shops, the lights of emergency workers played across the rubble on Sunday, in search of life.
Death was easy to find.
As smoke and dust rose into the Dnipro sky, a light dusting of snow began to accumulate on five victims who had been pulled from the rubble and laid out in body bags in a small grassy area next to the destroyed building. They were five of 30 confirmed killed in a Russian strike on a civilian neighborhood -- 79 were injured -- and at least 30 people remained unaccounted for.
Even some of those pulled from the debris that was once their homes seemed to have only an uncertain grasp on life.
"I have no words, I have no emotions, I feel nothing except a great emptiness inside," one 23-year-old woman, Anastasiia Shvets, wrote on social media.
An image of Ms. Shvets from the scene of the attack struck a chord with Ukrainians across the country. It shows a young woman clutching a stuffed animal and a golden Christmas garland as she stands in the ruins and waits to be rescued.
Ms. Shvets somehow emerged with only a small head wound and bruises on her legs. But her parents, she wrote on a verified account on Instagram, were still missing. And her partner, who was serving in the Ukrainian military, was killed in action four months ago.
The strike on Saturday at an ordinary, nine-story residential building led to one of the largest losses of civilian lives far from the front line since the beginning of the war, and it prompted renewed calls for Moscow to be charged with war crimes. In an address to Ukrainians on Sunday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was also critical to punish "those who grease the Russian propaganda machine."
He offered a warning to Russian citizens in their own language: "Your cowardly silence, your attempt to 'wait out' what is happening will only end with those same terrorists coming after you one day."
It is considered a war crime to deliberately or recklessly attack civilian populations or places where civilians would be likely to congregate, but Moscow has paid little heed to the international rules of war.
The assault on Dnipro was hardly the first time a Ukrainian population center far from the front lines -- including the city itself -- had been targeted since Russia invaded in February. Russian strikes on train stations, theaters, shopping malls and residential neighborhoods have led to significant loss of civilian life, as has the shelling of cities and towns near the front line.
But images of the devastation in the central city of Dnipro provoked anger and despair among Ukrainians, and the attack appeared to be part of a return to old tactics.
In recent months, Moscow has turned the focus of its assault on infrastructure targets that provide power, heat and water, apparently hoping to demoralize the country. But for reasons that remain unclear, over the weekend, Russia launched dozens of missiles at cities across Ukraine in two waves of strikes that coincided with the Orthodox New Year and shattered the relative calm of recent days.
The missile that struck the building in Dnipro appeared to have been a Kh-22 cruise missile, also known as an X-22 missile, according to Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense. She said it was one of five of them fired at Ukrainian territory that day.
The Soviet-era missiles weigh about 2,000 pounds, can be fired from long distances and are intended for anti-ship operations. They are also capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said the Kh-22 missile that appears to have hit Dnipro could have been launched by only one Russian unit, the 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment.
"This type of missile leads to the greatest human casualties, because the missile is extremely inaccurate," the office said. "Therefore, the use of such weapons for targets in densely populated areas is clearly a war crime."
More than 210 missiles of that type have been used in attacks on Ukrainian territory since Russia invaded, including a strike on a shopping center in Kremenchuk in June that killed 18 people.
Immediately after the Dnipro attack, pro-Russian news outlets and influential military bloggers claimed that the apartment building was not the target, but had been struck by fragments of the missile after Ukrainian air defenses tried to intercept it. But Ukrainian forces were quick to deny that, and the evidence from the scene pointed to a direct strike on the building.
"The Armed Forces of Ukraine have no weapons capable of shooting down this type of missile," Ms. Maliar said.
In fact, she said, the attack showed the need for antiaircraft missile systems like the Patriot system that Ukraine has long been lobbying its allies for. The United States and Germany have agreed to supply Ukraine with the Patriot system, and Ukrainian forces are to begin training on it in Oklahoma in the coming week.
Dnipro, a city nestled against the river of the same name, had a population of just under one million before the war began. After Moscow invaded, it was targeted by Russian shelling but never occupied by its forces, and never the scene of frontline fighting. The city has been home to displaced people who have flocked to its relative safety.

Even so, Dnipro has been intermittently targeted by missile strikes, and since October, when the Russian assault on infrastructure stepped up, a number have struck the city.
On Sunday, neighbors gathered at the site of the latest attack, looking on in disbelief. Less than 24 hours earlier, the area had been untouched.
Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said 72 apartments had been destroyed. The explosion also shattered the windows of surrounding buildings, leaving many more people displaced. Plastic sheeting had been taped over some windows blown out by the explosion, and workers were measuring others so that glass could be reinstalled.
By late afternoon, as firefighters searched the rubble for survivors, the air was filled with the sounds of cranes and crunching glass. Dump trucks rolled in and out of the area, collecting debris and clearing the streets surrounding the partly collapsed building.
A humanitarian tent city had sprung up, with volunteers making sandwiches and distributing tea and coffee to the hundreds of rescuers and residents on the scene. One tent had mattresses, blankets and tarps. Some people huddled around open bonfires for warmth in the frozen air.
Some residents of damaged buildings were waiting to get the go-ahead so they could collect their belongings. Others were already picking through what was left and taking what they could. With no windows in the bitter cold, it was impossible to stay.
More than 550 people were involved in the rescue operation, according to local officials.
As the 24-hour mark approached, at least one person, a 27-year-old woman, was pulled alive from the debris. She was taken to a hospital and was being treated for severe hypothermia, local officials said.
Mr. Zelensky said reports had been coming in from Dnipro all day.
"We are fighting for every person," he said. "The rescue operation will last as long as there is even the slightest chance to save lives."

Full text: The singer, who is expecting her first child, spends hours strolling through Brooklyn and reading.
Rachael Price is the front woman of the rock band Lake Street Dive. She is also half of the duo Rachael & Vilray, a jazzier act with a 1930s and '40s sound. This weekend, Ms. Price, along with the singer and guitarist Vilray, is releasing the duo's second album, "I Love a Love Song!" They are scheduled to perform at Williamsburg Music Hall on Feb. 24.
A resident of Kensington, Brooklyn, Ms. Price, 37, lives with her husband, the singer and songwriter Taylor Ashton, 33, with whom she occasionally performs at live shows. The couple's first child is due in late March. For now, their baby is Stella, their geriatric cat.
RAVENOUS I'm a morning person who leads a late-night life. It's kind of hard. Between 8 and 9 a.m. is my normal waking time, because I like to have enough time left in the morning to relax. I make coffee and breakfast and eat immediately. I've always been a first-thing eater. Right now I'm seven months pregnant, so I've been ravenous. Lately, because it's winter, I have the same thing every day, oatmeal. I grate an apple and use raisins and flax seed and top it with some Greek yogurt.
LITTLE MOVEMENTS Pregnancy is great; it's superfun still. I'm somebody who's sort of obsessed with the way I feel physically. That comes from being a touring musician and a singer -- you have to have this dogged awareness of how things are going so you can stay healthy. I find the body changes with pregnancy to be fascinating. If my gums are bleeding, I'll look it up, or if I have a wrist itch, I'll look it up and see it's a normal aspect of pregnancy. I think it's so weird and cool, these really specific things that can happen. The baby has started to move a lot. I'm feeling a lot of little movements. At this point it's still joyful.
ENGROSSED I'm a slow morning person. My favorite thing to do is to sit for two hours and read. I just finished a set of fantasy novels, "The Kingkiller Chronicle." Sometimes I'll read The New Yorker. I don't think I've ever picked up a New Yorker and read the short story and not been engrossed by it.
PUSH PREP After I read, I do my exercises. Right now I'm doing specific exercises for the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. It's all kinds of very diverse exercises, but a lot of core work to get myself ready for pushing. If I don't exercise in the morning, it doesn't happen.
STROLLING By noon I'm on a long walk. Walking is sort of my form of meditation. I live equally distant from Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery, so I choose between those two places. If I'm listening to a podcast, it might be "Poog," which is hosted by two very funny comedians. It's about wellness, but it's extremely broad. I find them to be soothing. If I'm walking in Prospect Park I'll stop by Daytime, a cafe in Windsor Terrace. I like their breakfast sandwiches. I'm so into breakfast I'll try to do it twice. There's always a lot of cute dogs outside and a nice little bench where you can observe Windsor Terrace people coming and going. It's also next to a really nice plant shop. I love plants. We'd have more if I didn't tour, but I find they die more readily than I'm able to take care of them.
FANS I get recognized maybe once or twice a day on a walk. It definitely doesn't bother me. They're almost always brief and pleasant interactions. Someone will say, "'I love Lake Street Dive!' and keep walking.
SELF-STYLED There's always an email to answer or different work-related things throughout the day. I may have an interview, like the one we're doing now, or oftentimes I'll have a package of clothes I'm trying on, looking for things to wear for shows. I have two boxes of clothes in front of me right now that I've ordered. Picking my own stuff to wear is a fun challenge.
SIFTING FOR SONGS We're both musicians living in a one-bedroom apartment, and we have a similar approach to creating. It helps to feel like you're entirely alone with your thoughts. If I find myself alone in the apartment for a few hours, I might sit down and play a song I'm learning on the guitar or go through old journals to comb for ideas for song lyrics, lines that jump out at me.
PARTY CAT If my husband and I are both home, there are a few things we like to do for the evening. We have friends locally, and we love to have them over for a game night. We'll play cards or charades or Salad Bowl. We're both pretty loud, hammy people. Our neighbors downstairs will not reveal themselves to us face to face, but they use some sort of device, maybe a classic broom, to bang the ceiling if we're getting too rowdy. They'll also bang at our cat, who has arthritic hips and thumps around flat-footed. I kind of want to go down there and say, 'Hey, you're banging at a cat."'
LIGHT NIGHT Dinner could be heavy snacking, like cheese, crackers and olives. Taylor is really good at making popcorn. He gets into the toppings. It could be nutritional yeast or maple syrup or butter. Sometimes he squeezes a lemon on there. It's always a surprise. Before bed, we'll watch a sitcom, anything that's funny and lasts 25 minutes. Or we'll watch clips of Derren Brown. He's a British magician and mentalist. Once you start watching, you go straight down the rabbit hole.

Louis Vuitton Pins Its Faith on a Scrappy Maverick: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A surprise collaboration should energize the men's wear shows in Paris as Colm Dillane, a.k.a. KidSuper, is handed the creative reins at the label.
In the further adventures of KidSuper, Brooklyn's homegrown superhero, Louis Vuitton announced on Tuesday that its men's wear show next week will feature designs created in collaboration with the designer, who has been quietly embedded for months in the Paris studio.
Succession at Vuitton remains the biggest mystery, and best guarded secret, in fashion. (Among the talents mooted for the job have been Martine Rose, Samuel Ross of A-Cold-Wall and Grace Wales Bonner.) And, while hardly confirmation that the label has found in KidSuper, a.k.a. Colm Dillane, a designer to fill the commercial and conceptual void left by Virgil Abloh's death in 2021, the news comes close to being a mission statement by the house.
"It's about chemistry," Michael Burke, Vuitton's chairman and chief executive officer, told Women's Wear Daily, referring not merely to Mr. Dillane but to a group of talents assembled for a men's wear spectacle that will involve the filmmakers Olivier and Michel Gondry -- best known for their music videos for Daft Punk, the Foo Fighters and Björk -- the stylist Ibrahim Kamara and the scenographer Lina Kutsovskaya. An appearance at the show by "a world-famous music star" is also expected.
If chemistry is key, so, too, are Instagram, TikTok and the inescapable reality that, as an industry shifts its focus inexorably toward entertainment, designers need far more in their kit bags than needle and thread. Mr. Dillane, as he is the first to say, cannot sew.
It hardly matters. Particularly at the largest houses, where accessories drive profits and designers are challenged to generate the cross-channel content central to a brand's identity and desirability. This is especially true at what was once a fusty luggage maker and is now the cornerstone of the world's largest luxury goods house, where sales last year topped $ 22 billion, according to estimates by the HSBC banking giant.
While it is true that men's wear accounts for just a portion of profits at Vuitton, its halo effect on the brand's image, which began when Mr. Abloh was appointed in 2018, cannot be overstated. And there is every reason to believe that Mr. Burke's motivation in choosing Mr. Dillane as guest runway designer was to advance a brand narrative.
From the outset it was clear that as a designer, Mr. Dillane, 31, was a great storyteller. While still a math whiz-kid at Brooklyn Tech, he began making and selling T-shirts in his school cafeteria. He presented one of his earliest collections in 2020 as a stop-motion film featuring modified Barbie dolls wearing miniature versions of his streetwear designs. Financing his own brand with the profits from cartoony KidSuper hoodies and T-shirts, he went on to create other shoestring productions starring his parents, people from his friend cohort, strangers filmed on the streets and invited to share their dream ambitions, and, perhaps most notably, Claymation figures.
It was the latter that attracted the attention of the judges for the prestigious LVMH Prize, which celebrates designers under 40; in 2021 it awarded him the runner-up Karl Lagerfeld prize with two other designers. As Mr. Abloh did, Mr. Dillane flourishes on creative collaboration. (Among his improbably commercial partners have been Puma, Jagermeister, Modelo and SpaghettiOs.) Yet unlike the relentlessly referential Mr. Abloh, who fulfilled the curator and art critic Nicolas Bourriaud's long-ago prophecy that, in the future, the D.J. would become the dominant figure in our culture -- Mr. Dillane is less mixmaster than irrepressible generator of ideas.
Asked last year by Mr. Burke to present a few designs for Vuitton, he instead produced a 500-page mission statement. "It was 5 percent product and 95 percent ideas and concepts," Mr. Dillane said by phone. As a first-generation American, the child of a Spanish mother and Irish father, he said, "I always felt this pressure to hustle and make the most of every opportunity."
As to what the future holds beyond Jan. 19, when his men's wear show will be presented, he said, "I have no idea."
The show, one of the most highly anticipated of Paris Fashion Week, should be seen as an experiment and not an audition, Mr. Burke suggested. "I think it's a little early," to make personnel predictions, he told WWD. Still, there is something both inspired and inspiring in the notion that a scrappy iconoclastic street kid from Brooklyn, a fashion outsider, may be chosen to propel the next iteration of a mighty global brand.
"You never think a brand as big as Louis Vuitton would be willing to take such a risk," Mr. Dillane said. "I thought there would be so many rules about what I was or wasn't allowed to do, but I was given the candy shop. They let me have a hand in every aspect -- clothing, bags, shoes, accessories. It's wild.
"But then," he continued, "when you look at their history, Marc Jacobs was a crazy decision, Virgil was a crazy decision. Sure, I'm a crazy decision, but this giant corporation turns out to be exactly the opposite of what I stereotyped."

Losing at Love? Maybe You're Just a Lousy Texter.: [Society Desk]

Full text: Relationship coaches are now helping single people navigate texting.
Shortly after Abby Norton met someone she liked on Hinge last July, the 24-year-old editor went on a two-week trip abroad. Given the different time zones, she and her potential suitor struggled to establish a texting routine while she was away, although on average there were a few texts per day.
Once Ms. Norton returned to Minneapolis, where she lives, the two hung out in person, but the texting still felt unsatisfying, remaining at "a couple of times a day, despite being back in the same time zone."
This left Ms. Norton with a lot of anxiety. "It came to a boiling point one night when I found myself crying" after not hearing from him for "a day or two" -- mainly, she said, because "it occurred to me that I probably had internal issues to work through that had brought me to this point of insecurity and anxiety."
So she decided to enlist the help of a professional in the newly emerging field of text-specific dating courses. She took a class called Texting Communication Cure Crash Course offered by licensed therapist and dating coach Kelsey Wonderlin, who is based in Nashville.
Ms. Wonderlin, who had been offering dating courses since fall 2021 but began catering specifically to texting issues starting in September, is one of the multiple dating coaches attempting to provide clients with the written communication skills necessary to take matches offline and into the real world -- and then keep them going. Among the questions they attempt to help their clients answer: What's a great first message to send on a dating app? How do you flirt in a way that's not too creepy? What if they simply don't respond?
With almost 180,000 Instagram followers, Blaine Anderson, a dating coach in Austin, Texas, has always found that her videos about texting have been a hit with her mostly male audience. This, in addition to her personal experiences receiving weird or too many messages on dating apps, inspired her to launch a course called Texting Operating System in August, "to eliminate guys' stress and anxiety from communicating with women via messages or text," Ms. Anderson, 33, said.
According to Damona Hoffman, a dating coach based in Los Angeles and New York and a host of the Dates & Mates Podcast, many people get stuck in what she calls "textationships." Texting has become its own phase of dating, she said, and her program, "The Dating Accelerator," which costs $ 1,297 and combines live coaching sessions and video lessons, teaches people how to avoid it.
Despite the widespread use of dating apps, experts like Ms. Hoffman, Ms. Wonderlin, and Ms. Anderson believe that our society as a whole still significantly lacks digital communication skills. The reason, according to Ms. Wonderlin, is that there isn't one place where people can go to learn how to start and maintain a healthy relationship. Instead, many are forced to figure things out on their own.
After all, texting is still a relatively new communication medium. "Our brains aren't wired to think in" 100-plus character messages, Ms. Anderson said. While texting is convenient, it lacks the texture and depth of in-person conversations. "Distilling our complex and nuanced feelings into crisp S.M.S. messages is hard, which makes it easy to inadvertently say the wrong thing."
Ms. Hoffman said it's not surprising people are struggling. While many people love texting for speed and efficiency, there's a lot of room for misinterpretation. And asking friends for advice can also open up a can of worms. Though one friend might tell you to delay a response so you don't seem too eager, another may encourage you to double text someone to show you're interested. Confusion ensues.
"Healthy communication education has always been missing," Ms. Wonderlin said, "but because most people meet online these days and begin messaging and texting back and forth immediately, texting has become the medium for how people form their communication patterns in a new relationship." And because so many people prefer to communicate over text rather than talking by phone before they meet, "it's important to set the tone early for reciprocal, healthy communication."
Ms. Anderson's two-hour video course costs $ 149 and is divided into seven modules that cover common dating scenarios, from taking a conversation offline to landing a second date. The course mainly focuses on the psychology behind different messages and provides texting templates.
Ms. Wonderlin's video course, which costs $ 333, takes students through five modules. It starts by addressing the importance of creating healthy communication early on in a relationship then covers different types of texters -- The Dry Texter, The Animated Texter, The Compulsive Texter, The Absent-Minded Texter -- and helps students understand what's a red flag and what is someone's particular texting style.
The course then teaches participants how to prevent a spiral when someone sends a one-word response or doesn't respond right away.
Dan Leader, a 36-year-old engineering manager in Detroit, signed up for Ms. Anderson's class in December "because I wasn't turning many matches into dates and when I was getting dates, they weren't leading to second dates," he said.
Since taking the course, "I text now with purpose and intention," he said. "I ask questions to get to know the person and so they can get to know me. Then I make a clear plan to set a date at an appropriate time. I no longer feel the need to keep the conversation going with small talk."
Though single people are generally taught that to be desirable you should be coy, disinterested or play hard to get, courses like Ms. Wonderlin's have given participants like Ms. Norton and Laura Matson, a physical therapist in Seattle, the confidence to admit when they need more communication from someone they are dating.
"Instead of overthinking and becoming anxious," Ms. Matson, 36, said she was coached to put the phone down and do calming activities before returning to the situation.
Additionally, clients are advised to resist overanalyzing and accept that there's really no way to know why they aren't responding. "Instead, challenge any assumptions and consider talking to them about it," Ms. Wonderlin said. "Or walking if this is a pattern and isn't working for you."

Concern Grows as Navalny's Wife Pleads for Him to Be Given Medicine: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Yulia Navalny said that her ailing husband, Aleksei Navalny, was being held in a small cell with a sicker person to infect him, and was not allowed to lie down throughout the day despite having a fever.
Questions swirled on Wednesday about the health of Russia's most famous political prisoner, Aleksei A. Navalny, after his wife publicly urged prison officials to provide her ailing husband with medicine.
Taking to Instagram, Yulia Navalnaya, said her husband's condition was worsening in the punishment cell into which he was once again placed as 2022 was drawing to an end.
"Imagine that you are shut in a cage measuring 2 by 3 meters," Ms. Navalnaya wrote. "That they place a person with you who is already sick, so that your cold grows stronger, and so that the flu is added on top of your cold. That they get you up at 6 a.m. and they keep you from lying down all day, even though you have a high temperature."
Her plea came a day after more than 200 Russian doctors, in a rare public display of dissent, sent a petition to President Vladimir V. Putin imploring him to "stop abusing" Mr. Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition politician.
In the past, Mr. Navalny's unrelenting criticism of Mr. Putin inspired large crowds of Russian protesters to take to the streets, and millions of people have viewed investigative reports about Russian corruption that his group has posted on YouTube, embarrassing the president and his allies. He has been repeatedly jailed, which analysts interpreted as the Kremlin's way of keeping Mr. Navalny out of national elections.
In August 2020, Mr. Navalny was the target of an assassination attempt that Western officials attributed to Russia, and he was taken to Germany for treatment. On his return to Russia in early 2021, Mr. Navalny was arrested and accused of violating the terms of an earlier parole. He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Mr. Navalny has continued to speak out even from prison, and in March, as a wartime Kremlin imposed strict limits on public expression, he was returned to court and resentenced to nine years in a high-security prison.
Mr. Navalny's health has deteriorated in the harsh conditions of imprisonment. In late December, posting on Twitter, Mr. Navalny said he believed that Russian officials were intentionally endangering his health to bend to their will. He said they had refused to provide him with his medical records.
Not long later, he had more news for his followers, delivered with his customary irony.
"I did manage to earn my tenth term in the punishment cell in the last year after all," he wrote. "My prison goons actually bothered enough to convene their commission on the weekend of December 31 especially for me."
HIs infraction, he said: Washing his face one morning 36 minutes earlier than he was authorized to do.
"Thus my plans for a fancy New Year were ruined," Mr. Navalny wrote. "I had saved a packet of potato chips and a can of saury" -- a type of fish -- "for it."
Ms. Navalnaya said Wednesday that she expected that her husband would recover from his latest illness. But she took aim at any skeptics tempted to minimize his condition.
"Aleksei caught a cold," she said. "You'll say: What nonsense, everyone catches a cold, and I agree with you. There is only one small difference.
"You are lying at home with a temperature, your relatives bring you medicine, hot tea, they worry over you. Even if you're at home with a temperature alone, you can lay in bed all day, and order yourself medicine from the internet. In a week you'll feel fit as a fiddle."

Full text: Supervising the search for the dream coat.
People get so dreary with their wool coats, like they're just workhorses. Wearing the same boring coat over and over for months -- months!!!!! -- just for warmth is an expression of defeat. After all, it's pretty much all anyone will see of you on the street for a while. Don't let the cold weather or seasonal affective disorder win.
What if your winter coat wasn't a workhorse but a show pony? What if the warmth it gave you was via super-luxurious fabric that swaddled you? What if it was a color other than black, navy or camel so the guy you see when you walk your dog refers to you as "that woman in the yellow coat"? What if a winter coat was about potential?
Vintage is a great move. Search Etsy or the RealReal (or the Gem app, which searches those places, along with sites like eBay, Grailed, Poshmark, Vestiaire Collective, even LiveAuctioneers), for one of the Phoebe Philo-era Céline llama wool coats (think 2015 to 2018 or so), buy it and worry about the price later. While you're looking for llama, try other fabrics like cashmere or, even better, vicuña.
It's probably a good idea to order coats that are returnable. Fit is certainly a consideration, but so is smell. Coats absorb odor, and even though dryer sheets and a fan can do a lot, it can't do much for the most perfect cashmere Bonwit Teller coat that has been in the home of a chain smoker since the 1970s.
I talked a friend out of an overpriced but low-quality coat from a mid-tier French brand and told her to search for vintage MaxMara or Jil Sander or the Row coats and to text me the results because I love supervising a shopping quest and I love being bossy. It worked. She's now the proud owner of an espresso brown cashmere coat that was about a quarter of what she was going to pay.
Here is what my dream coat wardrobe would be, each one a lesson in a winter well lived.
MaxMara
Can you even talk about fancy winter coats without talking about MaxMara? The brand has a few styles it does every year. The 101801 is the double-breasted coat, the Manuela is a wrap coat, but the one I have my eye on is the Ludmilla, which is the wrap coat with an A-line silhouette. The fullness at the bottom is reminiscent of the 1950s and feels a little optimistic. It comes in black and, even better, tobacco brown. But what if you got it in the bright cornflower blue cashmere? It would look good with pretty much anything (black, navy, brown, green, pink, yellow), I promise. ( $ 6,590)
Hermès
On Christmas Eve I ended up at the Hermès boutique in the meatpacking district, dropping off a repair. But while I was in store, I drank the free water I was given and went upstairs, where I zeroed in on this wrap coat in double-sided baby cashmere that's a shade somewhere between oatmeal and ivory. I spent a solid five minutes petting and photographing it. There's a small ring on one of the front pockets that you could attach your keys to. Would that be weird? I guess if you're walking around town in an Hermès coat, get as weird as you want. ( $ 8,050)
Alaïa
I have two different friends on the hunt for oversize, super-luxe peacoats. This Alaïa one has shape. In the front, it's business: just below the knees, big collar, vinyl-covered buttons. But it's a party in back with a low martingale (a sort of strap) that gives it a gathered look. It also comes in a two-button version that hits at the hips for a more classic peacoat shape. Why decide? I'll take both. ( $ 5,050)
Loro Piana
I will not entertain queries about the practicality of white coats. If you live in a world where you buy five-figure coats, practicality should not be your concern, either. I think there's a certain point in one's fashion journey where you get really into legacy Italian brands. MaxMara may be the gateway drug, but the end point is a label like Brunello Cucinelli or Loro Piana. This coat is a silk and cashmere blend that looks almost like a tweed. If you put it on, you'll look like a Hitchcock heroine, even if you're wearing sweatpants underneath. ( $ 10,125)
Kallmeyer
The scarf coat is a whole thing this year. I don't mean that disparagingly, just that there are a lot of potentially good ones to sort through. Toteme has a version, Tove has a version, but my favorite is from the New York label Kallmeyer. It's made in a cashmere-wool blend and -- this is crucial -- the attached scarf is detachable, giving you a lot of options. I would wear the scarf as a giant head wrap with a down jacket and leather pants in 18-degree weather, or wear the coats sans scarf and open with the vintage black Levi's 501s I just got on Etsy and my black Lucchese cowboy boots in 50-degree weather. ( $ 1,575)
Massimo Alba
Once, because of a canceled connecting flight, I had an unexpected afternoon in Rome. I decided I wanted to go to the Massimo Alba store. I went on foot, got totally lost, ate a mortadella sandwich and came upon the boutique only to find it closed. I think the lesson was something about the journey being the destination.
Tailored, men's-wear-inspired coats are everywhere right now, but I like Massimo Alba's Praga coat in navy the best. It has dropped shoulders that soften the look a bit. And while I'm talking about softness, coats are not costumes. I see women all over my Instagram feed wearing their tailored coats with trousers and silk tops as if they're playacting at being career women from a 1990s movie. Don't do that. Wear it with whatever you normally wear. Wear it over Julia Heuer pants! ( $ 2,635, on sale for $ 1,581)

Another Week, Another Meltdown, but This Time Stranded Fliers Can't Blame the Airlines: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fliers stranded by an F.A.A. system failure on Wednesday commended pilots and staff even as passenger advocates called the shutdown "shocking" and potentially avoidable.
Frequent fliers know that feeling well, particularly as air travel has roared back from pandemic lows: Their flight has been delayed, and then they receive little information about when -- or if -- it will take off, stoking feelings of anger and hopelessness.
But the Federal Aviation Administration system failure that caused more than 9,000 delays on Wednesday led to a slightly different dynamic for the frustrated passengers: This time, they didn't have the airline to blame.
"Because it was a systemwide, nationwide thing, there was nowhere to direct your outrage, so everybody was being really helpful," said Jess McIntosh, a political consultant whose American Airlines flight was delayed in Albany, N.Y. "And nobody was yelling at the T.S.A. agents."
The outage that halted takeoffs for about 90 minutes on Wednesday morning was caused by the failure of a system that the F.A.A. uses to send timely safety alerts to pilots. Flights began to resume at around 9 a.m., the F.A.A. said, but the effects continued to snarl air traffic throughout the day.
Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, which represents airline consumers, called the shutdown "shocking" and potentially avoidable.
"The fact that this could happen at all shows the real vulnerabilities to the computer system that the F.A.A. operates," he said. The F.A.A. said it was still investigating the cause of the disruption to the NOTAM -- short for Notice to Air Mission -- alert system. There was no evidence of a cyberattack, said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary.
Mr. Hudson said that while the cause of the disruption is still unknown, it is clear that the F.A.A. needs to update its computer system and conduct more "stress tests," such as drills conducted at airports and by airlines to prepare for emergencies.
In terminals across the country, just weeks after mass cancellations by Southwest Airlines left thousands of travelers stranded, many passengers were sanguine about yet another chaotic day for air travel.
Bettina Inclán, who was traveling to Houston from Washington, said her United pilot kept everyone on her delayed flight informed and calm.
"The entire United team did really well in setting expectations, being honest on what they knew and didn't know, and what it all meant," she said.
As Sara Hole, of Stamford, Conn., and her fiancé, Drew Tomlinson, waited by their gate at Newark Liberty International Airport on Wednesday morning, they got the impression that the American Airlines staff members were just as confused as the passengers.
Over the intercom, an airline representative told them there was an F.A.A. "system outage," but there were few other details.
"They have emphasized that they have all of the same information that we do," Ms. Hole said.
Some of the passengers may have been accommodating, but their plans were no less ruined. Ms. McIntosh, who left for the airport at 4:30 a.m. to catch a flight to Raleigh, N.C., for a business meeting, eventually went back home when she realized she was going to miss most of it. Ms. Inclán had to rearrange several meetings, and Ms. Hole said she and her fiancé would probably miss their connecting flight in Phoenix, disrupting their planned hiking trip in Utah for Mr. Tomlinson's birthday.
Several major airlines, including Delta, American and United, announced that they would waive any fees typically associated with changing flights because of Wednesday's delays and cancellations.
The fact that the disruption came from the F.A.A. and not an airline dealing with overbooked flights may explain why many passengers were not as outraged as they might have been, said Mike Arnot, an industry analyst.
"Safety first, and that's the right call," he said. "By and large, this will be hopefully forgotten by most of the traveling public soon."
Not everyone was so understanding.
Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and the ranking member in the Senate aviation committee, called for accountability from the F.A.A. on what went wrong.
"The flying public deserves safety in the sky," he said in a statement. "The F.A.A.'s inability to keep an important safety system up and running is completely unacceptable."
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 workers, said the disruption was a "frustrating" reminder of the need to update the computer systems that airline crews rely on to operate.
"We'll find out more about the root cause of the issue in the coming days," Ms. Nelson said, "but what's clear is the need for robust and stable funding this year to bring our aviation system into the 21st century."
Paola Canales, who was flying Spirit Airlines to Honduras with a layover in Florida, said the malfunction made her worry about the integrity of the system.
"Think about it," she said. "Hacks happen all the time now."
Sayron Stokes, a passenger headed from La Guardia to Oakland, Calif., on Southwest, said she was "very mad" about the meltdown as she looked for a quiet corner of the airport for a nap on Wednesday. "We need to do something better," she said.
At Newark Liberty International Airport, Jaime Vallejo, 52, who owns a cleaning company, was worried about catching his connecting flight from Miami to Ecuador. He was traveling with his wife and three children and had just learned that his 12 p.m. flight had been delayed by two hours.
Mr. Vallejo said he was also frustrated that the F.A.A. did not send him any direct notification, which would have saved him the stress of rushing to the airport.
"I didn't receive so much as an email," he said.
Unlike Southwest's holiday season meltdown, when passengers aimed their anger squarely at the airline and some of its workers, the disappointment on Wednesday couldn't be pinned on a specific company or even severe weather. No matter the airline or the region of the country, everyone was in the dark.
It led to confusing scenes in the early morning as the picture came into focus. Venus Marcil said she and her uncle were on their plane at Orlando International Airport, seatbelts fastened and their plane cleared for takeoff for their 7:25 a.m. Delta flight to New York, when the pilot said they would not be departing.
The passengers deplaned, and she was told she would receive an update in about two hours.
But that wasn't Delta's fault, she said.
"I think they've been transparent and timely with the communication," Ms. Marcil said of the airline.

How Finland Teaches Even Youngest Pupils To Spot Misinformation: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A typical lesson that Saara Martikka, a teacher in Hameenlinna, Finland, gives her students goes like this: She presents her eighth graders with news articles. Together, they discuss: What's the purpose of the article? How and when was it written? What are the author's central claims?
"Just because it's a good thing or it's a nice thing doesn't mean it's true or it's valid," she said. In a class last month, she showed students three TikTok videos, and they discussed the creators' motivations and the effect that the videos had on them.
Her goal, like that of teachers around Finland, is to help students learn to identify false information.
Finland ranked No. 1 of 41 European countries on resilience against misinformation for the fifth time in a row in a survey published in October by the Open Society Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria. Officials say Finland's success is not just the result of its strong education system, which is one of the best in the world, but also because of a concerted effort to teach students about fake news. Media literacy is part of the national core curriculum starting in preschool.
"No matter what the teacher is teaching, whether it's physical education or mathematics or language, you have to think, 'OK, how do I include these elements in my work with children and young people?"' said Leo Pekkala, the director of Finland's National Audiovisual Institute, which oversees media education.
After Finland, the European countries that ranked highest for resilience to misinformation in the Open Society Institute survey were Norway, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland and Sweden. The countries that were the most vulnerable to misinformation were Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. The survey results were calculated based on scores for press freedom, the level of trust in society and scores in reading, science and math.
The United States was not included in the survey, but other polls show that misinformation and disinformation have become more prevalent since 2016 and that Americans' trust in the news media is near a record low. A survey by Gallup, published in October, found that just 34 percent of Americans trusted the mass media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly, slightly higher than the lowest number that the organization recorded, in 2016. In Finland, 76 percent of Finns consider print and digital newspapers to be reliable, according to an August survey commissioned by a trade group representing Finnish newspapers that was conducted by IRO Research, a market research company.
Finland has advantages in countering misinformation. Its public school system is among the best in the world. College is free. There is high trust in the government, and Finland was one of the European countries least affected by the pandemic. Teachers are highly respected.
On top of that, Finland's language is spoken by about 5.4 million people. Articles containing falsehoods that are written by nonnative speakers can sometimes be easily identified because of grammatical or syntax errors, Mr. Pekkala said.
While teachers in Finland are required to teach media literacy, they have significant discretion over how to carry out lessons. Mrs. Martikka, the middle school teacher, said she tasked students with editing their own videos and photos to see how easy it was to manipulate information. A teacher in Helsinki, Anna Airas, said she and her students searched words like "vaccination" and discussed how search algorithms worked and why the first results might not always be the most reliable. Other teachers also said that in recent months, during the war in Ukraine, they had used Russian news sites and memes as the basis for a discussion about the effects of state-sponsored propaganda.
Finland, which shares an 833-mile border with Russia, developed its national goals for media education in 2013 and accelerated its campaign to teach students to spot misinformation in the following years. Paivi Leppanen, a project coordinator at the Finnish National Agency for Education, a government agency, said the threat of Russian misinformation on topics such as Finland's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "hasn't changed the basics of what we do, but it has shown us that this is the time for what we have been preparing."
Even though today's teenagers have grown up with social media, that does not mean that they know how to identify and guard against manipulated videos of politicians or news articles on TikTok. In fact, a study published last year in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology found that adolescence could be a peak time for conspiracy theorizing. A contributing factor could be social media, with its influence over young people's beliefs about the world, the study's authors wrote.
Still, the Finnish government says students are among the easiest group to reach. Now that programs are in place for young people, the government is using libraries as centers for teaching older people to identify online information that is intended to mislead, Mr. Pekkala said.
For teachers of any age group, coming up with effective lessons can be challenging. "It's so much easier to talk about literature, which we have been studying for hundreds of years," said Mari Uusitalo, a middle and high school teacher in Helsinki.
She starts with the basics -- by teaching students about the difference between what they see on Instagram and TikTok versus what they read in Finnish newspapers. "They really can't understand fake news or misinformation or anything if they don't understand the relationship between social media and journalism," she said.
During Ms. Uusitalo's 16 years as a teacher, she has noticed a clear decline in reading comprehension skills, a trend she attributes to students' spending less time with books and more time with games and watching videos. With poorer reading skills and shorter attention spans, students are more vulnerable to believing fake news or not having enough knowledge about topics to identify misleading or wrong information, she said.
When her students were talking this summer about leaked videos that showed Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, dancing and singing at a party, Ms. Uusitalo moderated a discussion about how news stories can originate from videos circulating on social media. Some of her students had believed Ms. Marin was using drugs at the party after watching videos on TikTok and Twitter that suggested that. Ms. Marin denied having taken drugs, and a test later came back negative.
Ms. Uusitalo said her goal was to teach students methods they could use to distinguish between truth and fiction. "I can't make them think just like me," she said. "I just have to give them the tools to make up their own opinions."

Uusitalo said her goal was to teach students methods they could use to distinguish between truth and fiction. “I can’t make them think just like me,” she said. “I just have to give them the tools to make up their own opinions.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Royal Tell-All Is Everywhere. Has the Public Heard Enough?: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Even in the United States, which has a high tolerance for redemptive stories about overcoming trauma and family dysfunction, the tide seems to be turning.
In their prolonged campaign to tell their story -- and to present themselves as victims of the British royal family, the tabloid press and critics and haters everywhere -- Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, have in the last two years revealed their secrets to Oprah Winfrey, revealed them again to various sympathetic television interviewers, produced and starred in a six-part Netflix series and, in the case of Harry, appeared on the actor Dax Shepard's podcast, "Armchair Expert."
Now comes the prince's multimillion-dollar ghostwritten memoir, "Spare." Set for release Tuesday, it has been leaking out over the last few days, one eye-popping detail after the next. (The book mistakenly appeared in stores early in Spain, and was snapped up and translated by alert members of the British news media, injecting an element of chaos into the publisher's rollout.)
Harry and Meghan still have many sympathizers, particularly those who see the couple's grievances through the lens of the racism Meghan encountered in Britain and who say that she -- and Harry, once he married her -- never stood a chance in such a stultified, reactionary institution as the monarchy.
But something has changed, judging from the response so far. Even in the United States, which has a soft spot for royals in exile and a generally higher tolerance than Britain does for redemptive stories about overcoming trauma and family dysfunction, there is a sense that there are only so many revelations the public can stomach.
"Look, everyone has a family," the television host Don Lemon declared on "CNN This Morning" last week. "I have arguments in my family. Am I going to put that out there for the whole world to see? I don't understand why on earth he would want to put that out there. I know he's selling a book, but to me it's just ..." ("Gauche," he added later.)
Was it gauche, for instance, for Harry to accuse Prince William of pushing him to the floor while the two argued about Meghan, ripping Harry's necklace and shattering a dog's bowl whose shards then gouged his back? Or to describe how the brothers squabbled in front of their father after Prince Philip's funeral? ("Please, boys, don't make my final years a misery," Charles is quoted as saying.) How about Harry's account of how, high on mushrooms, he believed a garbage can was talking to him, or the passage about how Meghan offended Kate, the Princess of Wales, by boldly asking if she could borrow her lip gloss?
It's one thing to be criticized; it's another to be openly ridiculed.
It can't be a great sign, for instance, that the Jimmy Kimmel show last week staged a re-enactment of the supposed argument in the kitchen that it called "Two Princes." Set to a voice-over of an actor reading the passage in a plummy English accent, the skit featured two actors who were, bizarrely, each dressed as the musician Prince.
On the other side of the Atlantic, four media personalities on the couch of the British show "This Morning" could barely keep it together last week as they discussed another revelation in the book, Harry's account of the first time he had sex.
"An older woman took his virginity and then, when the act of darkness had been completed, he lay on his front and she smacked his bottom," said one, the writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth, to peals of laughter.
Preorders have already catapulted the book to the top of best-seller lists, and the ubiquitous coverage is unlikely to damage sales, at least in the short term.
"I'm sure they don't mind all the publicity," said Jeffrey W. Schneider, a co-founder of the public relations firm The Lead PR, speaking of the book's publisher, Penguin Random House. "It is also true that what is good for a publisher is not necessarily the same as what is good for the person who has published the book."
Indeed, more worrying for Harry and Meghan is whether the continued public re-litigation of their troubles has grown so repetitive or even tiresome that it has eroded their personal brand and damaged their potential future earnings. Once they have exhausted the topic of themselves, what is left for them to talk about?
"It's overload," Schneider said. "There's been a lot about them, and now there's a lot more. While people's fascination has always been pretty high, maybe there is a natural limit to that."
If he had been advising Harry and Meghan, said Howard Bragman, the chairman of the crisis-management firm La Brea Media, he would have impressed on them that there is only so much mileage you can get out of a finite amount of material.
"You have to realize that you can really only tell your story once," Bragman said.
There is also the question of timing. Harry's book is being published shortly after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. Whatever you think of the monarchy, Elizabeth's funeral gave the royal family the chance to showcase qualities like discretion, fortitude, an adherence to duty and tradition, and an aptitude for remaining publicly stoic in the face of private grief.
But Harry embodies the opposite of all that. With his revelations about private family conversations, his accounts of his anguish and unhappiness at the behavior of his father, stepmother and brother, especially in the wake of his mother's death, and his eagerness to divulge un-regal details about topics like Meghan and Kate's high-drama altercation over the bridesmaids' dresses at his and Meghan's wedding, he presents a stark contrast to William and, especially, to Kate, who in public have said exactly nothing about any of this.
"It feels a little reality-television-y to me," Bragman said of the Harry-and-Meghan media offensive. The couple, he added, "feel a little Trumpian, in that they seem like they can't let a grudge go."
Alas, even one of the queens of reality television, the former "Real Housewives of New York City" star Bethenny Frankel, believes that Harry and Meghan have finally said too much.
"Is it too late to change the name of Harry's book to 'Dirty Harry Laundry?"' Frankel said in a video on Instagram, filming herself as she lay in bed. She decried the level of detail in the book. "How much more? Are we going with Meghan to get a Pap smear? I mean, what's next?" ("Okay, but how is this any different than the reality shows that you did?" a commenter named wendyjo79 responded, which seemed like a fair point.)
Many people have defended Meghan and Harry on social media and elsewhere in the last few days. But for every person who sticks up for the couple, there is someone else who says that enough is enough.
"We've all just fallen down some wormhole where we will never be free of hearing every single detail of Prince Harry's life and why he believes no one has ever had a worse life than his," the former "View" co-host Meghan McCain said on Twitter. "This is never going to end. He's never going to let us live!"

King Phojanakong, 54, Who Enticed New Yorkers to Crave Filipino Cuisine: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His first restaurant, Kuma Inn, became destination dining despite its location on what was then a quiet stretch of the Lower East Side.
King Phojanakong, who in the 2000s led the charge in bringing Filipino cuisine to the American culinary mainstream with his first restaurant, Kuma Inn -- an impossibly tiny spot on the Lower East Side that quickly developed a passionate following -- died on Jan. 2 in Manhattan. He was 54.
His wife, Annabel Nau-Phojanakong, said the cause of his death, in a hospital, was complications of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, a rare disease that attacks the spinal cord and brain.
The son of a Filipino mother and a Thai father, Mr. Phojanakong was both classically trained and steeped in the home-cooking traditions of his parents' native countries. His mother taught him to prepare Filipino comfort food like pancit canton, made with richly spiced noodles, and adobo chicken, the vinegary unofficial national dish of the Philippines. He made them his own by spiking them with some of the sweet notes found in Thai cuisine.
After studying at the Culinary Institute of America and working at top Manhattan restaurants like Daniel, Jean-Georges and Danube, Mr. Phojanakong opened Kuma Inn on Ludlow Street in 2003. (The name is a play on the Tagalog word "kumain," which means "eat.") It was only the second sit-down Filipino restaurant in Manhattan, after Cendrillon in SoHo, which opened in 1995.
The restaurant was difficult to find and, at the time, considered far off the city's beaten gastronomic path. Tucked between two nondescript shops, a simple red door opened onto a vertiginous staircase that led up to the studio-size dining room.
"It felt like someone's apartment; the room was dark and cramped," the chef Neil Syham, a former owner of Lumpia Shack Snackbar in Greenwich Village, said in a phone interview. "But what I remember most is the smells that came out of his restaurant: the smells of fish sauce, Chinese sauces, soy sauce -- those just smacked you in your face, and it just brought me back to Southeast Asia."
Mr. Phojanakong's menu, built around small plates, was stocked with Filipino favorites like seared sausages and lumpia (which is similar to a spring roll). His cooking was detailed but unfussy. He used traditional Filipino ingredients like calamansi, a type of citrus, and coconut vinegar -- though he was no purist, and he occasionally substituted Western ingredients like apple cider vinegar if he felt it would help the dish.
Occasionally he would push further, cooking foods that even many Filipinos find challenging, like dinuguan, or pork-blood stew, and balut, a partly fertilized duck egg.
"He had a really great palate and a really great sense of flavor," Anne McBride, the vice president for programs at the James Beard Foundation and a longtime admirer of Mr. Phojanakong, said by phone. "He brought a subtle and balanced approach to flavor that created very people-pleasing food that you wanted to eat over and over again."
Mr. Phojanakong was not just a pioneer in bringing Filipino food to the city. He was also one of the first chefs to trade the safety of a haute-cuisine career for the chance to explore their passion without a net.
Kuma Inn was a shoestring operation. Mr. Phojanakong and a friend did the décor. The music came from a CD player loaded with his own playlists. When the heat from the kitchen made the dining room a bit too toasty, Mr. Phojanakong cracked the fire-escape window.
It was, Dana Bowen wrote in The New York Times in 2004, "an auteur restaurant if there ever was one, sprung entirely from Mr. Phojanakong's imagination."
The early 2000s were a time before social media, before Instagram influencers, before the rush of food-centered public relations firms, before buzz was something you could buy, back when word of mouth was literally just that.
Yet somehow word did spread about this garrulous, talented chef dishing the fiery, florid flavors of his mother's homeland somewhere on the Lower East Side -- though no one could ever quite explain where; you just had to look for it.
"To me that choice speaks volumes about King," Nicole Ponseca, the former owner of the Filipino restaurant Jeepney and a co-author of the cookbook "I Am a Filipino" (2019), said in a phone interview. "It says, 'My food is good. I think you'll enjoy it. And I'm going to pick this obscure location on top of another obscure location knowing that you'll find it."'
Celebrities became regulars. So did many of the city's young Filipinos. And aspiring chefs came to see Mr. Phojanakong do what had once been considered impossible: make the once-derided, even feared, cuisine of the Philippines friendly, approachable and hip.
"What was good about it was, he wasn't pretentious about it," said Amy Besa, who co-founded Cendrillon and is now an owner of the Brooklyn restaurant Purple Yam. "It was just good home cooking."
King Phojanakong, a lifelong resident of Manhattan, was born there on Aug. 18, 1968, and grew up in Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling East Side residential development. His father, also named King, owned a series of small retail businesses, and his mother, Zosima (Arceo) Phojanakong, known as Emma, was a nurse.
Along with his wife, he is survived by his parents; his children, Phebe and Eduard; and his brother, Paul.
After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science in 1986, he studied at the State University of New York at Purchase and the City College of New York, but he did not graduate from either. He received an associate degree in culinary arts from the Culinary Institute of America in 1998.
In 2009, six years after opening Kuma Inn, Mr. Phojanakong opened Umi Nom, on the border of Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. Like Kuma Inn, it was intentionally nondescript, located in a former laundromat whose awning still hung over the door. This time he focused on skewers, egg noodles and other Filipino drinking food -- "uminom" means "drink" in Tagalog.
Mr. Phojanakong closed Umi Nom in 2015, and the pandemic forced him to close Kuma Inn in 2021. He pursued other projects: a pop-up menu in the basement of Jimmy's No. 43, in the East Village, and more recently Cook Like King, through which he offered custom-designed cooking classes.
He was especially proud of Bronx Hot Sauce, a venture that bought serrano peppers from community gardens around the Bronx to make into a garlicky, fiery condiment.
"He wanted to invite people into the food," Ms. Ponseca said. "He was using his skills, his memory, to invite them into whatever kitchen he was cooking."

A Showdown Is Set Up, Pending Legal Obstacles: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Davis stopped Héctor Luis García in a bout that showed his power and precision. He wants to fight Ryan Garcia next, but he also has court cases from a crash and an altercation with a woman.
After Round 8 of his bout against Gervonta Davis at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night, Héctor Luis García trudged back to his corner, sat on his stool and informed his trainer that he could not see.
The temporary blindness did not result from an accident, like an inadvertent thumb in the eye. It came from Davis's power. A volley of punches late in the eighth had culminated with a left hand to García's right cheek that whiplashed his head, buckled his knees and impaired his vision.
When García refused to answer the bell for Round 9, Davis, who was born and raised in Baltimore, was declared the winner by technical knockout. He climbed to the top rope in a corner of the ring and backflipped to the canvas.
Davis, 28, emerged from bout -- and his celebration -- injury free. He is now pointed toward a high-profile showdown in April against Ryan Garcia, an undefeated lightweight with social media cachet and mainstream fame. Few active boxers are familiar enough to casual sports fans to appear in Gatorade commercials; Ryan Garcia, who is not related to Héctor García, co-stars in one with the N.B.A. star Damian Lillard.
Davis and Ryan Garcia have spoken openly about fighting this spring, but just because fans, promoters and the fighters want the bout does not mean it will happen. The long-delayed welterweight title match between Errol Spence Jr. and Terence Crawford is a case in point. Spence is now scheduled to face Keith Thurman, and the International Boxing Federation has indicated that the winner of that bout should not meet Crawford but instead face Jaron Ennis, who beat Karen Chukhadzhian in a unanimous decision on Saturday night.
An hour after Davis dispatched Héctor García, a reporter at the postfight news conference asked the boxer whom he planned to fight next, just in case plans had changed.
They had not.
"If it's up to me, Ryan's definitely next," said Davis, who is 28-0 with 26 knockouts.
From a boxing standpoint, Davis has plenty of control over his short-term future. He completed the final bout of his contract with Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s promotional company last May, and has acted as his own promoter since then. Davis, the World Boxing Association's lightweight champion, works closely with Al Haymon, the boxing power broker and head of the Premier Boxing Champions managerial outfit. But Davis has final approval over his opponents.
With the Ryan Garcia bout all but locked in, Davis agreed to a bout with Héctor García, a 31-year-old southpaw from the Dominican Republic who trains in Las Vegas. Last February, Héctor García upset a highly rated prospect named Chris Colbert to earn a shot at the World Boxing Association title in the 130-pound super featherweight division. He won that belt via unanimous decision over Roger Gutiérrez last August, then landed the bout with Davis.
Though García moved up a weight class, he entered Saturday's bout with height and reach advantages. Davis had trained for García less as a tuneup opponent than an interim challenge, and the ideal opponent to showcase Davis's tools.
"That's the type of wins I like," said Calvin Ford, Davis's trainer. "When he's putting it together, and showing his real talents."
But Davis's future also hinges on the outcome of a criminal trial, set to begin in February, on hit-and-run charges. Prosecutors in Baltimore allege that on Nov. 5, 2020, Davis ran a red light in his Lamborghini and crashed into another vehicle, injuring its four occupants. A judge in that case previously rejected a plea proposal that would have allowed Davis to avoid jail time.
Eleven days before Saturday's bout, Davis was arrested in Parkland, Fla., and charged with battery, accused of striking a woman on the side of the head. Later, his girlfriend posted on Instagram that she and Davis had an intense argument but that nobody was hurt.
"While the emotions were running high, I made an unnecessary call to law enforcement," her post read.
Davis pleaded not guilty last week.
The cases prompted Showtime's Jim Gray, the in-ring interviewer on Saturday's broadcast, to ask Davis how he could prevent derailing his own career.
"You said this week that the only one who can beat me is me. How do you avoid that happening?" Gray said.
Davis pledged to stay focused, and rely more heavily on people he trusts, like Haymon.
Inside the ring, Davis remains a reliable, efficient problem solver. After tensely contested early rounds, Davis widened his advantage with his signature style: low output, high precision, high power. García threw 345 punches, landing 55. Davis threw 239, but landed 99, including the overhand lefts late in Round 8 that compelled García to quit the fight.
"My head still hurts," García told Gray a few minutes later, during an in-ring interview. "My vision is back."
Because the current cohort of world class lightweights are fluent in social media, the buildup to and after Davis's win were riddled with online bickering.
Before the bout, Devin Haney, who holds belts from all of the major sanctioning bodies, retweeted a video of himself sparring with García, implying he had already beaten up Davis's opponent.
Just after the bout, a contender named Frank Martin tweeted the word "food" with a pair of emojis, hinting at his belief that he could feast on either Davis or García.
Ryan Garcia spent the week sniping with Davis and other fighters over Twitter, then declared he was taking future conflicts offline.
"No more talking let's get it on," he tweeted. "APRIL 15."
That would be pending Garcia's final sign-off and any developments in Davis's legal cases.

Help! An Airline's Mistake Made Me Miss a $17,000 Cruise.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An American Airlines error kept a traveler from getting to her cruise's departure, but the carrier wouldn't take financial responsibility and her trip insurance refused to pay. Then our columnist stepped in.
Dear Tripped Up,
I was set to take what for me was the "trip of a lifetime," a $ 17,000 Antarctic cruise with Australia-based Aurora Expeditions. But when I tried to check in for my flight from Nashville to Santiago, Chile (via Miami), the check-in agent insisted that entering Chile required two forms I had never heard of, even though I had researched the requirements carefully. I missed my flight, and the cruise. When I complained, American Airlines quickly refunded the (nonrefundable) flight, but Aurora would not give me credit for a future cruise and my travel insurer, Trip Mate, denied my claim. I'd like American to acknowledge in writing that they made a mistake and use that to ask Aurora to reconsider and to file an appeal to Trip Mate. Can you help? Deborah, Franklin, Tenn.
Dear Deborah,
I have good news for you: American will reimburse you for the total cost of your cruise.
I have bad news for everyone else: Getting you reimbursed for the airline's obvious incompetence was such a maddening process, even for me, that I have very little hope for average consumers who suffer equally absurd wrongs in the future.
For starters, Trip Mate and Aurora could have been more understanding or even -- though this is a stretch -- humane. In an ideal world, American would have immediately recognized its error in writing, Trip Mate would have approved your claim for at least a portion of the cruise's cost, and Aurora would have made up for another chunk with a sharp discount on a future cruise.
This is especially true given how responsible and persistent you were before, during and after your debacle.
You researched requirements for entering Chile on Sherpa, a free website that helps with travel documentation, determining correctly that a valid passport and a proof of Covid-19 vaccination were enough. When you were told differently at the airport, you pleaded your case, asked for (and were denied) an explanation in writing, returned to the airport later to seek such explanation, and wrote what you described to me as more than 25 emails to American, asking for a written statement to support your insurance claim and your request to Aurora for credit.
How could the original error have happened? My best guess is that the American agent confused the requirements to enter Chile as a whole to the much stricter documentation needed to visit the country's isolated Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island). And then he stuck to his guns. So did American customer service: The responses they sent were unfailingly polite and entirely unhelpful. In one nonsensical email you forwarded, an American representative appeared to be plugging in random boilerplate language. "While I am glad that we were still able to accommodate you," he wrote, "I realize that it was not the flight of your choice."
Even so, you correctly filed a claim with Trip Mate. "The reason provided for your claim is not covered under the trip cancellation provisions," they told you in a denial email. You also asked Aurora for credit, but they said you needed to cancel 90 days in advance, not one.
I would be remiss not to point out your one mistake: You booked a multi-leg, international flight that was to arrive less than 24 hours before your very expensive trip was to begin, a risky plan. But just because someone walks perilously close to the edge of a cliff does not absolve the person (or airline) that pushes them over.
American began by refusing my request to interview someone on the record, or even to answer my list of questions in writing. After an extensive back and forth, I finally received a brief statement from the airline's director of corporate communications, Jermaine Spight, saying it was "unfortunate" that you were unable to complete your journey and the company had already refunded the cost of the flight. "We are reviewing additional documents recently submitted," he continued, "and hope to reach an amicable resolution soon."
You then forwarded me communications with an American representative who pledged to be back in touch in 18 to 21 days. It sounded to me like American would offer you something that was neither an admission of guilt nor the full value of the cruise.
Then, to see how you might fare if you declined their offer and sued them instead, I dove into the sprawl of legal documents on American's site.
I knew from previous mind-numbing reading of airlines' conditions of carriage that they go to great lengths to limit their liability to the value of the airfare, regardless of subsequent consequences. But, at least in American's case, not great enough lengths.
Rule 25 of their 299-page General Rules of the International Tariff limits American's liability when it refuses to board passengers for everything from traveling barefoot to having a diagnosed illness that may cause them to "become obnoxious aloft" and, of relevance to your case, when "travel documents are not in order." But nowhere does it mention limited liability when they mistakenly refuse you boarding.
I pointed this out to American and drafted a column urging you to take American to small claims court in Tennessee (and offering to be your witness). But before we published, Mr. Spight wrote again with the good news.
Great. But this should not have been your (or my) battle to fight. This sort of situation is precisely why we have travel insurance.
I asked Trip Mate to explain why your claim had been denied. A spokesman, Patrick Jordan, said to me via email that your plan only covers specific events, called "hazards."
"While we empathize and understand that the insured's travel was negatively impacted," he wrote, "the plan does not cover errors made in determining travel documentation."
I begged to differ, noting that your policy covers trip delays caused by common carriers "including, but not limited to, scheduled departure and return times and actual departure and return times." That "not limited to" implies to me that events like being involuntarily bumped from a flight or, say, being told mistakenly by a rookie agent in Nashville that you can't board a flight to Chile, also qualify as potential "hazards."
I told this to Trip Mate, and they seemed to blink, if just slightly. "With any claim that is submitted," Mr. Jordan wrote back, "we look at the situation holistically to see where we can apply benefits within the limits of the specific policy." The policy does limit reimbursement for "trip delays" to $ 3,000, though.
What about Aurora? They were "deeply sorry to hear" you were unable to make it, said Cameron Ward, an Aurora spokesman. "Unfortunately, a multitude of travel incidents happen all the time. It's for this reason we require all of our guests purchase travel insurance that provides complete coverage for any number of issues that may arise."
Fair enough, but I think Aurora was in a good position to be generous (and score some good P.R. points). Finding a way to get you on a future cruise with a nice discount -- perhaps under the condition you take one that was not expected to fill up -- would cost them a lot less than $ 17,000. When I offered such a suggestion, they declined to comment.
Which brings me to how I'm feeling about customer service in the travel industry as we enter 2023. After careful review of this newspaper's policy on the use of curse words, I, too, decline to comment.

King Phojanakong, who in the 2000s led the charge in bringing Filipino cuisine to the American culinary mainstream with his first restaurant, Kuma Inn — an impossibly tiny spot on New York City’s Lower East Side that quickly developed a passionate following — died Jan. 2 in Manhattan. He was 54.
His wife, Annabel Nau-Phojanakong, said the cause of his death, in a hospital, was complications of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, a rare disease that attacks the spinal cord and brain.
The son of a Filipino mother and a Thai father, Phojanakong was both classically trained and steeped in the home-cooking traditions of his parents’ native countries. His mother taught him to prepare Filipino comfort food such as pancit canton, made with richly spiced noodles, and adobo chicken, the vinegary unofficial national dish of the Philippines. He made them his own by spiking them with some of the sweet notes found in Thai cuisine.
After studying at the Culinary Institute of America and working at top Manhattan restaurants such as Daniel, Jean-Georges and Danube, Phojanakong opened Kuma Inn, on Ludlow Street, in 2003. (The name is a play on the Tagalog word “kumain,” which means “eat.”) It was only the second sit-down Filipino restaurant in Manhattan, after Cendrillon, in SoHo, which opened in 1995.
The restaurant was difficult to find and, at the time, considered far off the city’s beaten gastronomic path. Tucked between two nondescript shops, a simple red door opened onto a vertiginous staircase that led up to the studio-size dining room.
“It felt like someone’s apartment; the room was dark and cramped,” chef Neil Syham, a former owner of Lumpia Shack Snackbar in Greenwich Village, said in a phone interview. “But what I remember most is the smells that came out of his restaurant: the smells of fish sauce, Chinese sauces, soy sauce — those just smacked you in your face, and it just brought me back to Southeast Asia.”
Phojanakong’s menu, built around small plates, was stocked with Filipino favorites such as seared sausages and lumpia (which is similar to a spring roll). His cooking was detailed but unfussy. He used traditional Filipino ingredients such as calamansi (a type of citrus) and coconut vinegar — although he was no purist, and he occasionally substituted Western ingredients such as apple cider vinegar if he felt it would help the dish.
Occasionally, he would push further, cooking foods that even many Filipinos find challenging, such as dinuguan, or pork-blood stew, and balut, a partly fertilized duck egg.
“He had a really great palate and a really great sense of flavor,” Anne McBride, vice president for programs at the James Beard Foundation and a longtime admirer of Phojanakong’s, said by phone. “He brought a subtle and balanced approach to flavor that created very people-pleasing food that you wanted to eat over and over again.”
Phojanakong was not just a pioneer in bringing Filipino food to the city. He was also one of the first chefs to trade the safety of a haute-cuisine career for the chance to explore their passion without a net.
Kuma Inn was a shoestring operation. Phojanakong and a friend did the decor. The music came from a CD player loaded with his own playlists. When the heat from the kitchen made the dining room a bit too toasty, Phojanakong cracked the fire-escape window.
It was, Dana Bowen wrote in The New York Times in 2004, “an auteur restaurant if there ever was one, sprung entirely from Mr. Phojanakong’s imagination.”
The early 2000s were a time before social media, before Instagram influencers, before the rush of food-centered public relations firms, before buzz was something you could buy, back when word-of-mouth was literally just that.
Yet, somehow word did spread about this garrulous, talented chef dishing the fiery, florid flavors of his mother’s homeland somewhere on the Lower East Side — although no one could ever quite explain where; you just had to look for it.
“To me that choice speaks volumes about King,” Nicole Ponseca, former owner of the Filipino restaurant Jeepney and co-author of the cookbook “I Am a Filipino” (2019), said in a phone interview. “It says, ‘My food is good. I think you’ll enjoy it. And I’m going to pick this obscure location on top of another obscure location knowing that you’ll find it.’”
Celebrities became regulars, as did many of the city’s young Filipinos. And aspiring chefs came to see Phojanakong do what had once been considered impossible: make the once-derided, even feared, cuisine of the Philippines friendly, approachable and hip.
“What was good about it was, he wasn’t pretentious about it,” said Amy Besa, who co-founded Cendrillon and is now an owner of the Brooklyn restaurant Purple Yam. “It was just good home cooking.”
King Phojanakong, a lifelong resident of Manhattan, was born there Aug. 18, 1968, and grew up in Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling East Side residential development. His father, also named King, owned a series of small retail businesses, and his mother, Zosima (Arceo) Phojanakong, known as Emma, was a nurse.
Along with his wife, he is survived by his parents; his children, Phebe and Eduard; and his brother, Paul.
After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science in 1986, he studied at the State University of New York at Purchase and the City College of New York, but he did not graduate from either. He received an associate degree in culinary arts from the Culinary Institute of America in 1998.
In 2009, six years after opening Kuma Inn, Phojanakong opened Umi Nom, on the border of Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant, in Brooklyn. Like Kuma Inn, it was intentionally nondescript, located in a former laundromat whose awning still hung over the door. This time, he focused on skewers, egg noodles and other Filipino drinking food — “uminom” is Tagalog for “drink.”
Phojanakong closed Umi Nom in 2015, and the pandemic forced him to close Kuma Inn in 2021. He pursued other projects: a pop-up menu in the basement of Jimmy’s No. 43, in East Village, and, more recently, Cook Like King, through which he offered custom-designed cooking classes.
He was especially proud of Bronx Hot Sauce, a venture that bought serrano peppers from community gardens around the Bronx to make into a garlicky, fiery condiment.
“He wanted to invite people into the food,” Ponseca said. “He was using his skills, his memory, to invite them into whatever kitchen he was cooking.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Must We Gentrify the Rest Stop?: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: McDonald's is gone, and the Manhattanization of the New York State Thruway has begun. Prepare to Instagram your pit stop.
Five years ago, the New York State Thruway Authority conducted a survey of more than 2,600 drivers to take measure of the customer experience at the service areas lining the 570 miles of road that make up one of the largest toll highways in the country, stretching from the edge of the Bronx up past Buffalo. Whether participants were traveling for work or for pleasure, they had needs that apparently were going unfulfilled.
Among those who identified as occasional users of the Thruway, more than half said they would like food halls with "local artisan" offerings. Some commuters wanted Blue Apron meal kits. The resulting report listed as chief takeaways that leisure travelers complained about unappealing interiors and the lack of "Instagrammable moments."
In a society so casually stratified that major airlines now offer five classes of service and airport security lines can be bypassed for an annual fee, rest stops remain one of the few spaces in modern life that can be generally counted on to level us. Whether you've arrived in an eighteen-wheeler or a Porsche S.U.V. or a 16-year-old Toyota beater, whether you are a devoted consumer of high fats or an otherwise restricted eater of lean proteins and whole grains, you will park, pass through a comfortingly dull stretch of hardscape and order the McDonald's fries either by way of habit or self-gifted nutritional loophole.
That particular indulgence, though, is no longer available on the New York State Thruway. As of New Year's Day, all outposts of McDonald's were closed, the company's contracts having expired on Dec. 31, 2022. The disappearance of the chain is part of a grand plan of "modernization," in the words of a spokeswoman for the state authority, which began more or less with cashless tolling and is currently taking hold in the reimagining of the Thruway's 27 service areas in line with the desires of a blonde-wood-admiring and flaxseed-positive traveling public.
Two years ago, following a bidding process, the job of operating the service areas went to an Irish company called Applegreen, a conglomerate of gas stations and convenience stores backed by the investment giant Blackstone. Applegreen and its partners will pick up the entire cost of the redevelopment ( $ 450 million), leaving public money untouched and delivering what renderings suggest will be the rest stop conceived as a WeWork conceived as a modern weekend place in the farmhouse style. Some spots might have business areas, and the selfie magic might begin in front of floor-to-ceiling windows under an inscription that reads: "Eat Local. Drink Local."
The Thruway's service areas were originally built in the mid-1950s and brought the equalizing experience of cafeteria food to a world that was much more egalitarian. Howard Johnson's arrived in the 1980s. McDonald's entered the frame a decade later, the last time the stops were remodeled. The current reinvention will bring local farm stands, food trucks and, among some other fast food selections, the polarizing choices of Chick-fil-A, run by a red-state billionaire contributor to anti-LGBTQ causes, and Shake Shack, founded by a liberal billionaire restaurateur who came to prominence serving expensive food around Union Square.
Certainly, there are many reasons to consider it great progress never again to be led into temptation by the golden arches on this stretch of roadway, reminded of the scourge of low-wage work, environmental damage and the aggressive undermining of public health. But on the countervailing side, where we might find some modicum of social good, McDonald's provides a business model that does not market identity. You don't get to pretend that you are chic, or rich, urbane or pious when you order a Double Quarter Pounder With Cheese. You are not buying into a philosophy or a lifestyle; you are buying 740 calories of distraction from life.
For many of its democratizing influences, social media has demanded the imposition of bourgeois aesthetic values all across retail culture, no matter how alienating they might be to those who don't live in a world of plant-based foods and felt-upholstered furniture and who have neither the time nor inclination to record their consumer transactions on camera. The newly transformed La Guardia Airport plays to the iPhone and the compulsion for rarefied space, with an almost perversely cosmopolitan restaurant scene.
On internet chat boards, however, drivers are already registering their frustration with the Thruway changes. Given the deep and longstanding tensions between central New Yorkers and those living downstate, it is not obvious that the people of Utica, for example, would be delighted by the Manhattanization of the highway, over merely maintaining functional generic space that allows them to refuel, grab a sandwich and move along, a dozen potential Instagrammable moments be damned.

Shuffling the Deck, and Tending to Shrines: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Jeanna Kadlec cherishes rituals like Tarot card readings, book store outings, buying offerings for her altars and lighting candles.
Jeanna Kadlec is a believer. She believes in the supernatural and in paying attention when an idea hits you, which is what happened when she came up with the title of her memoir, "Heretic," about leaving the evangelical church. "It was a lightning bolt out of the sky," she said.
Growing up in small-town Iowa, Ms. Kadlec was raised at the crossroads of strict evangelicalism and conservatism. Her memoir tells the story of her devout childhood and adolescence, and of how she married a pastor's son, but then realized that she was queer. Although she left the marriage and the church, she said, she is not an atheist. "I wasn't like God doesn't exist, there is nothing."
Instead, Ms. Kadlec began reading tarot. Tarot and astrology introduced her to the idea that she had authority over her own life, something that felt foreign in the church, she said, adding that some elements of her upbringing remain important to her. "I have still chosen to prioritize community and a spiritual life," she said.
Ms. Kadlec, 35, the creator and author of the newsletter Astrology for Writers, lives in central Brooklyn with her partner, Meg Jones Wall, 37, a tarot reader.
KIBBLE I'm very cuddly, so Meg and I are probably cuddling in bed, but eventually we wake up and I start my day immediately with coffee and breakfast. I have chronic migraines, so eating right away is a must for me in order to help delay or manage them. I have to load myself with protein first thing, so I've been eating a certain kind of Kashi cereal. I call it my breakfast kibble. Then I'll usually have eggs or some other protein-based item an hour or so later. That sets me up pretty well for a decent migraine day.
CARDS Once coffee and breakfast are all set, Meg and I will read each other's tarot. One of us picks the deck, which usually these days is the Modern Witch Tarot deck. We both read cards very differently. Meg has a beautiful way of shuffling and she blesses the cards before she actually pulls them, whereas I, in spite of my love of routine, chaotically only read the cards that jump out when shuffling. She actually has a wonderful book on tarot coming out in March called Finding the Fool. Sometimes it turns into an hourlong dissection of something that is happening and we get to have this deep dive right at the beginning of the day. Extremely gay.
OUTSIDE I go on an anxiety walk. Leaving the house helps keep me sane. I live in a very friendly neighborhood. Just this last week I ran into one of my Twitter mutuals when we were both out on our daily sanity walks and it was like, "Oh, I'm out for my walk. 'I'm out for my walk, too."' Stop, hug, squeal, keep going.
EDIBLE OFFERINGS So then I'm going to tend to the shrines in our house. This includes the one that I have for my ancestors. I'll swing by Brooklyn Kolache. My family is Czech and my grandfather used to make kolaches -- they are open-faced pastries with fillings -- that I had all the time when I was growing up. On Sundays, I try to make a point to pick up a sweet cheese or a poppy seed kolache so I can put it on my ancestor altar and have it live there for a day or so as one of my offerings. Just to check in and say hello, love you, thinking of you. When I'm picking them up for my ancestors, I'm picking up the traditional flavors, but Meg likes their bacon, egg and cheese kolache.
BROWSING I might walk over to one of our local bookstores like Greenlight, Cafe con Libros or The Word is Change and see what's new. We're really loving The Word is Change lately because it's also a used bookstore and I love a store that has a lot of clutch, used, vintage-y titles. One of the last times I was there, I picked up a queer theory book from the 1990s called "Barbie's Queer Accessories," by Erica Rand. It's so up my alley. I'm a very lipstick lesbian type who is obsessed with Barbie and also with queering Barbie.
DINNER PARTY If I'm meeting up with a friend, we might do these things together or we might go to the Brooklyn Museum to see one of the new exhibits, like they have this Thierry Mugler exhibit now. Meg and I really love taking friends who are visiting to the Brooklyn Museum. A lot of my friends who visit don't realize that The Dinner Party is at the Brooklyn Museum. To walk The Dinner Party with someone for the first time feels very spiritual. I see new names every time I go.
DISH DUTY After that, I'm done with walking for the day and I'm heading home. Meg usually cooks dinner. I'm very lucky I have a partner who loves to cook and she spoils me that way. I think it's a very easy trade-off to do the dishes. Meg makes a killer lasagna. That's a people-are-coming-for-dinner meal. She also totally reclaimed mussels for me. I used to hate them but the way that she cooks them, she has shown me the light. We love to drink really funky orange wines or whatever our local wine shop recommends to us.
SANCTUARY We adjourn to our living room. We're really into a lot of unscripted Dungeons & Dragons shows like Critical Role and Dimension 20 and we watch them on our television. We have a very moody atmosphere for the evening. We light a million candles. It's a very methodical process. Ritual can be a big word but I learned very early that it can be very simple. It can just be lighting a candle. Also I can't handle really harsh lighting with my migraines. We have tall, black pillar candles and fresh flowers everywhere. It just feels very feminine and very romantic. It's like our sanctuary in a way.
PART OF THE PROBLEM My body tells me it's time for bed at 10 p.m. I am a nana. Like, lesbian bars are dying and I'm a part of the problem. So I go and do the skin-care routine and am probably going to read some fan fiction. I read very widely across of a lot of fandoms. We blow out the candles and once we're doing that I'm so tired. Lighting them and witnessing them is so beautiful and then when we're blowing them out, we're so tired.

Falling in and Out of Love With 'Red Scare': [Correction]

Author: Rabkin, Eugene

Abstract: None available.

Full text: How I kicked the "Red Scare" habit.
In the middle of the pandemic my wife and I moved to Manhattan from Brooklyn. There would be less space for Gerda, our husky, but no more 45-minute car commutes and no more road rage. I would walk everywhere. And I would take Gerda with me.
Those first morning walks were exciting for both of us. As we rounded the island's southern tip, I admired the view of the Brooklyn Bridge as Gerda lunged at scraps of food. But soon the charms of the garbage-strewn plaza in front of the Staten Island Ferry started to wear off, and the 1980s architecture of Battery Park City seemed to take on a generic look. With so much to sniff, Gerda was content, but I felt the need to fill the hours with something that would drown out the city noise and occupy my brain.
A friend recommended "Red Scare," a cultural commentary podcast, pointing out that it was hosted by two self-described "bohemian layabouts" from the former Soviet Union, Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. Since I'm from Belarus, my friend thought the show would speak to me.
When I was 15, my family left the Soviet Union as political refugees fleeing anti-Semitism. I made it through the local public high schools and a mediocre business college that left me with more student debt than knowledge, before I finally learned something while getting a master's degree at a liberal university. Each of my 30 years in America had gradually chipped away at my once-rosy view of my adopted home as I battled my way out of poverty, material and spiritual.
Politically, I was on the left, the Marxist teachings of my Soviet youth only strengthened by the injustices I saw during my formative years in the United States. But in the past several years I've come to feel lonely on the political spectrum, finding moments of sanity in conversations with friends, rather than in publications that seem to favor opinion-driven pandering. Still, I looked to the news media for a reality check, hoping that someone out there must have a clue. But where do you find sanity in an insane world?
When I started listening to "Red Scare" on my walks with Gerda, I felt like I had found a refreshing critique of the increasingly polarized political landscape. While situating themselves on the left, Ms. Khachiyan and Ms. Nekrasova didn't shy away from calling out the excesses of so-called progressivism. They waded into the culture wars, highlighting the absurdity and cynicism of corporate media while emphasizing that the poor always seemed to get fleeced in the end.
The hosts went after the political naïveté of some leftists and criticized slogans like "Defund the Police," noting that the police were more often than not from lower-middle-class and minority backgrounds. Ms. Khachiyan spoke highly of "The Culture of Narcissism" by Christopher Lasch, one of my favorite books.
On my rounds with Gerda, I came to think that the hosts shared a mature, European sensibility to go with a certain wisdom common to immigrants who have grown up without privilege and are able to see America with some clarity.
I wasn't the only one enthralled with "Red Scare." Patreon reports that it has roughly 12,000 supporters who collectively donate nearly $ 53,000 a month. Part of the show's appeal has nothing to do with politics. Mixed into their dissections of current events, the hosts frequently discuss shopping, beauty regimens and bits of celebrity gossip. The show's popularity is probably helped by the celebrity of Ms. Nekrasova, an actress who has appeared on "Succession."
More often than not, I nodded along as I listened to back episodes. Gerda and I started spending more time on our walks, much to her delight, and my headphones discouraged strangers from trying to engage me in mind-numbing doggy chitchat. To celebrate her new outdoorsy lifestyle, Gerda took NASCAR-style laps around the dog run, chasing off the males who tried to hump her.
But somewhere along the way, the podcast began to grate on me. Maybe it was when Ms. Khachiyan offered a defense of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who fatally shot two men and wounded another during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Wisconsin. (Mr. Rittenhouse was acquitted of criminal charges in 2021.) And it didn't sit well with me when Ms. Khachiyan questioned the efficacy of vaccines in the efforts to curb Covid-19, describing herself as becoming "an even more conservative Covid truther."
While "Red Scare" had played host to favorites of the so-called dirtbag left -- Slavoj Zizek, Adam Curtis and John Waters -- a guest in November 2021 was Alex Jones, the founder of the misinformation website Infowars and a prominent conspiracy theorist who described the killings of 27 people, including 20 children, at the Sandy Hook Elementary School as a hoax.
The hosts were apparently trying to rehabilitate his reputation, asking him softball questions like, "Do you feel like a caricature that the liberal media made you out to be?" A photo posted on Ms. Nekrasova's Instagram account at the time of the interview shows the two hosts on either side of a smiling Mr. Jones, with Ms. Nekrasova's arm around him. (Late last year Mr. Jones was ordered by a court to pay the victims' families nearly $ 1.5 billion in damages.)
Ms. Khachiyan declined to comment about the apparent shift when I contacted her via email for this essay. Ms. Nekrasova did not reply to requests for comment. In a 2019 interview with The Face, the hosts complained about critics who have likened them to "crypto-fascists." "The idea that we're somehow dangerous or influencing discourse in a toxic way is unfair and misguided," Ms. Nekrasova said. Her co-host added, "We are two chicks with an entertainment radio show that you can voluntarily opt in or out of. We're not policymakers or political figures."
Increasingly, I was dismayed by what I was hearing. Did they truly believe what they were saying? Was it a function of being children of Russian-speaking immigrants, whose conservatism, often tinged with racism and anti-socialist sentiment, is commonplace and one of the reasons I couldn't wait to get out of my old Brooklyn neighborhood?
On it went, along with their talk about their shopping trips and spa routines. Worst of all was the careless spouting of increasingly provocative and unsubstantiated views. I found myself stopping 20 minutes into each episode, wondering why I was wasting my time. As I fumbled with my phone, Gerda looked at me judgmentally for interrupting our walks.
One day a "Red Scare" episode notification popped up on my phone. I hit the little x. Then I deleted the podcast.
Since then I've been mostly listening to music, which allows me to spend time with my thoughts as we navigate the narrow downtown streets. Gerda doesn't seem to mind, as long as she has something to sniff.

Full text: Meg He felt an immediate connection with Margot Ciccarelli during a private jiu-jitsu lesson more than three years ago.
Before it was ever put into words, the connection, between Meg He and Margot Ciccarelli was apparent from their movements.
Ms. He and Ms. Ciccarelli both practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In 2019, when Ms. He first took up the martial art, she searched the internet for accomplished women whose techniques she could emulate. Her search turned up Ms. Ciccarelli, a professional jiu-jitsu athlete and teacher. Ms. He sent her an Instagram message, complimenting Ms. Ciccarelli's dancing, her style -- and her hair.
"I wanted to be really clear that I didn't admire her for what she had won before or her titles," said Ms. He, 35. "It was that her style was really unique and interesting."
A friendship took root. The women shared similar backgrounds. Each was British Chinese and an only child. Ms. Ciccarelli, who never stayed in one place very long, offered to take Ms. He on as a student and give her a private jiu-jitsu lesson if their paths ever crossed. In June 2019, they did. The women met in London, when Ms. He made a trip to visit her parents. The lesson was supposed to last an hour. It lasted three.
Ms. Ciccarelli was impressed by how much Ms. He, a novice, was able to understand about jiu-jitsu's nuances. Ms. He said she felt self-conscious and out of her depth. She said when she and Ms. Ciccarelli touched, her body responded in unexpected ways. "I was unable to control myself around her," Ms. He said.
Ms. Ciccarelli explained that the complexity inherent in jiu-jitsu can make it a very meaningful and deep exchange between opponents.
"It's a partner-based sport, said Ms. Ciccarelli, 29. "We're always creating something new."
A couple of weeks after that sparring session, Ms. Ciccarelli traveled to New York City for a competition and stayed with Ms. He. They saw little of each other because of Ms. Ciccarelli's demanding schedule. But Ms. Ciccarelli left behind her "lucky gi," a garment she had worn in competitions, with a note, suggesting Ms. He could return it when they next met. Ms. He knew that something more than friendship was brewing between them.
Both Ms. He and Ms. Ciccarelli identify as pansexual. But Ms. He, a founder and co-chief executive of Aday, a sustainable clothing brand, was not out publicly, or to her parents. She also had never dated a woman before. Although she was willing to take that step, Ms. He worried that Ms. Ciccarelli's nomadic nature would make a relationship untenable.
Ms. He was determined, however, to tell Ms. Ciccarelli how she felt.
In September, they met in San Diego, where Ms. Ciccarelli was participating in another jiu-jitsu competition. The two stayed at an Airbnb that Ms. He had rented. One evening they walked to a lighthouse along the Point Loma coast to watch the sunset. While sitting on a bench, Ms. He told Ms. Ciccarelli that she had feelings for her. Ms. Ciccarelli responded: "I know."
Ms. He said her shock caused her to fall backward off the bench. Ms. Ciccarelli fell, too, in solidarity.
Soon after, Ms. Ciccarelli, who was competing overseas, made frequent visits to New York. Their relationship was challenged by bouts of long-distance separation, as well as the pandemic, which forced Ms. Ciccarelli into a prolonged depression, not being able to compete.
"Every relationship has its ups and downs and you've got to choose who you want to do that with," Ms. Ciccarelli said. "I don't want to be annoyed by anyone else."

The tumult of the last couple of years also ushered growth, both personally and athletically. In May 2021, Ms. Ciccarelli became a black belt. And in November 2021, Ms. Ciccarelli proposed in Abu Dhabi, where they were participating in the World Professional Jiu-Jitsu Championship. "I wanted to show that I was committed to not being nomadic, that I was committed to her and committed to our ongoing journey," Ms. Ciccarelli said.
In October, the couple moved to Costa Mesa, Calif., to allow Ms. Ciccarelli the opportunity to train with a black belt master.
The couple had an intimate ceremony on Dec. 26 at a private residence in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Los Angeles. Nina Faulhaber, who is Ms. He's business partner, officiated, having been ordained for the occasion by the Universal Life Church.
Dozens of guests joined via Zoom, a fitting format for a couple with so many loved ones scattered across the world, they said. They plan to visit many of them in person over the next year, and embark on many more "crazy journeys" together, Ms. Ciccarelli said.
"At every single point, I knew that Margot was the most interesting person I'd ever met," Ms. He said. "I don't want to spend my life with anyone less interesting."

For Some, the Mask Maintains Its Hold: [Style Desk]

Full text: In early December, at least one party at Art Basel in Miami featured a sight not seen in some time: bowls of nuts on a bar, intended for communal consumption. "Is this a test?" one well-heeled attendee asked her friend.
Probably not, but it was a sign that many people were willing to return to prepandemic practices, and all the germ spreading that came with it.
There have been other signs too: Fishbowl cocktails with multiple straws are back on bar menus. Buffets have made a comeback at conferences, casinos‌‌ and galas. In November, Brianna Lapaglia, a 23-year-old in Manhattan who has her own podcast, "PlanBri Uncut," on Barstool Sports, said: "I feel like we are doing all the things we did before the pandemic, but ‌10 times harder." To wit, she was going to dive bars, house parties and clubs where she and her friends would pass a bottle and drink straight from it.
Some surveys supported this semi-sigh of relief. YouGov, a market research company, found that 49 percent of American adults didn't wear a mask at the beginning of December, compared with 16 percent almost a year ago in early January. Morning Consult has been asking consumers on a weekly basis about their comfort returning to prepandemic habits and activities. In the middle of December it found that 78 percent of Americans were comfortable going out to eat (compared with 66 percent in mid-December 2021) and 65 percent were comfortable going to a party (compared with 46 percent).
But now, Covid-19, the flu and R.S.V. are raging, creating a tripledemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended a return to masking (as did Mayor Eric Adams of New York, while wearing one). Some people are starting to pivot. And some are resolutely not. Which is creating certain tensions and aggravations.
Sound familiar?
'Who Wants to Get Sick?'
The first time Hayley Cranberry Small, 31, a ceramist in Brooklyn, took off her mask back in September, she ended up with Covid. "I went to a fashion week and an art gallery opening in TriBeCa," she said. "I wanted to look cute, so I took my mask off."
When she tested positive for Covid, "it was this feeling of, 'Wow, classic, of course I go out without a mask on one time, and I get Covid,"' she said.
But time passed and she did it again, this time in early December for her birthday. She and a friend went to Twins Lounge, a two-floor bar in Greenpoint that packs in over a hundred people at a time on weekends.
"I didn't want to wear a mask at the bar," she said. "It isn't cute."
This time she woke up with strep throat, another illness making its rounds through New York City. She has vowed not to go anywhere crowded or take her mask off again. "A lot of my friends are going out, and a lot of people expect you to be comfortable at this point," she said. "But I don't care anymore. Who wants to get sick?"
Keep Calm and Party On
As a Transportation Security Administration officer in San Juan, Angela Ochoa, 53, knows the risk. But in the middle of October, she went on a four-day cruise from Los Angeles to Ensenada, Mexico, where she spent her nights dancing to cover bands in the theater. During the day, she exercised in the gym and shopped in crowded ports.
She recently caught Covid but doesn't regret any decisions. "I knew I would get Covid sooner or later because everybody gets it," she said. "Now that I got it I am like, OK, I don't have extreme symptoms because I am vaccinated. I feel better about doing all these things, including going on a cruise again."
Patrick Pho, 39, who works in marketing and lives in Arlington, Va., understands he may get sick this holiday season. "December always feels like the perfect storm," he said. "Besides the expected holiday parties thrown by friends, my birthday falls around a week before Christmas."
He attended three holiday parties and threw himself a birthday party, a happy hour at a bar in Washington, D.C. "I am aware of the higher chances of getting sick at this time of year," he said. And he feels protected: "I got the latest bivalent Covid vaccine," he said, adding that he also got a flu shot.
An All-Too-Familiar Stress for Parents
Jessy Roos, 36, is a mother of four, ages 8 to 18 months, who owns a therapy practice in Calgary, Alberta. She has been shocked by how many children have gotten sick this season.
"I have two friends with small children hospitalized right now with pneumonia," she said. For the past two weeks, her children have been passing a flulike virus from one sibling to the others.
"I finally pulled them out of school last week even though their last day of school isn't until this week," she said. "There has been no break. We're cycling from one illness to another." She is especially concerned about her children catching something else since their local hospital is already overwhelmed with patients and there is a global shortage of antibiotics. She said it's all she and other parents can talk about.
On Dec. 9, she tweeted about how her child cried after not being able to go to a new friend's birthday party at an indoor play place. "There's simply no way to make that a safe activity," she wrote. "I hate this." She was shocked by the vitriol aimed back at her from strangers. "On Twitter, on Facebook, on Instagram, I was inundated with aggressive, awful DMs," she said. "I got one-star business reviews, and people emailed me." She changed all her settings to private.
Julia Dahl, 45, a novelist and professor of journalism at N.Y.U. who lives in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., decided to skip all holiday gatherings this year. "We are not doing anything social outside of my family," she said.
"I've probably skipped two holiday parties and then multiple things like, 'Somebody has a gig at a local bar or coffee shop,"' she said.
"It's a risk-reward thing," added Ms. Dahl, who has a 7-year-old son. "The risk of spending three hours in somebody else's home with a whole bunch of people, the reward is so great because it's camaraderie and fun, but it's not worth the risk of bringing any number of illnesses right now into my family."
She said her friends, the people hosting the parties or inviting her for nights out, have been understanding. "The people I really care about seem very cool with it," she said. "They are like, 'I get it, it's probably dumb to have a party anyway, and let's go for a walk or have a cup of coffee outside next week."'
The person she is battling with, however, is herself. "I hate that I am like this," she said. "I am a total extrovert, and I love parties."
She tells herself it won't last. "I feel like this is not forever, and I am willing to do another holiday season where I don't do a lot," she said. "I hope next year will be better, but right now my priorities are my family and keeping us healthy and happy. It's a price to pay, but it doesn't feel like a huge price to pay."

In a Pinch, the Engineers Have Become Bloggers: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In a perpetually tricky market for tech talent, large companies are turning to an in-house resource to get the word out.
In 2021, Cristian Velazquez helped Uber fix an important software issue. First, he and his teammates diagnosed a data processing flaw that could've stopped the app from working correctly. Then they developed a way to clear memory more efficiently, saving the company time and money.
That's the simple version, at least.
The public can read a more detailed account of the project from Mr. Velazquez on Uber's engineering blog, in a post titled "How We Saved 70K Cores Across 30 Mission-Critical Services (Large-Scale, Semi-Automated Go GC Tuning @Uber)." Be warned, though, it helps to understand technical jargon such as Go, CPUs and garbage collection.
As a staff site reliability engineer, Mr. Velazquez fully grasped those terms. At the time, though, he didn't know much about blogging. In fact, despite working as an engineer at Uber for close to three years, he didn't know the company had an engineering blog until he was asked to write for it.
"This is the first job where I started doing more external work," he said. His first blog post took a few months to finish. "I learned a lot from that one," he said. "It was a lot easier to do the next one."
That's fitting because many people learned about Uber's engineering blog from Mr. Velazquez. His post generated over 84,000 page views since it was published in December 2021, according to the company's internal data, making it one of the site's most popular pages.
Uber is one of several large companies hoping to reach engineers this way. Organizations like Google, Apple and Meta that aspire to build the future of technology are also in the blogging game -- a relic from the early days of the internet.
These sites combine glimpses into what life is like at a company with case studies about complex programming tasks. The posts tend to have the titles of grad school papers and the editorial flair of instruction manuals. They're often created to increase transparency, provide resources to the engineering community -- and entice people to go work at these companies.
"It fills that gap between your company careers page and the job description," said Jennifer Hindle, director of product marketing at Stack Overflow, an online platform where tech workers can ask and answer questions.
Stack Overflow found that 48 percent of developers use these types of blogs and other company-owned media when researching possible employers.
"It's sort of like the way Instagram is to people's real lives, where it's these highlights of a cool thing," said Devin Riley, an engineer who has worked at tech firms such as GitHub, an open software platform, and Braintree, a payments processing company. "There's a lot of drudgery and day-to-day plumbing work that has to happen for these tech companies that isn't particularly exciting and they're never going to put on their blog."
Mr. Riley recently left his position at GitHub after more than three years. He said he became tired of fully remote work and a new manager who failed to outline career growth opportunities. In his new job search, he ranked compensation, company mission and quality of the product as his top criteria. An engineering blog won't influence his decision to work somewhere more than a great salary, but it still has sway. He consults them for clues about what a company values.
"Engineering blogs give you a couple signals," he explained. "They consider engineering a core part of their business, and they're willing to invest in writing about what they do."
Some companies seem to invest more fully than others. Brands like Uber go into detail about important projects, but engineering blogs, at their worst, can read like glorified news releases and turn off potential job applicants.
"If I read a blog post and can tell it's been written by a salesperson, I roll my eyes and quit two sentences in," said David Walsh, a senior full stack engineer at the cryptocurrency company MetaMask, who also runs a personal tech blog. "If I can tell that it was written by an engineer on the team, that's someone who's been in the foxhole and had to accomplish something important. That's someone who, as an engineer, I have admiration for, I can empathize with."
Publishing these in-house engineering blogs, and encouraging people to write for them, is not a risk-free proposition. For posts to be effective, they require honesty. Yet tech companies are usually secretive about their products, not wanting leaks to give competitors any potential edge.
Now, these same companies are voluntarily disclosing their challenges and bringing in more transparency.
The blogs don't cost much to operate, companies say, since engineers aren't typically compensated extra for their writing. But running this type of publication comes with a price: time. Engineers typically earn some of the highest salaries in tech. Contributing to a blog pulls them away from their primary work of building and maintaining a company's products. As a result, it can take months to complete a single story.
"Whether our editors are taking the lead writing the story, or our engineers or data scientists are, we need an investment of time from our subject matter experts -- time they don't always have," said Anita Clarke, Shopify's senior managing editor.
Companies have to navigate these trade-offs during an especially chaotic period in tech. The industry continues to add tens of thousands of new jobs every month, but at the same time, more than 153,000 workers were laid off in 2022, per layoffs.fyi, a site that logs job cuts.
Even for companies juggling the possibility of layoffs, hiring skilled engineers is vital. Surveys have shown that tech founders and executives believe that product and engineering roles were the hardest to fill.
"That's a challenge for employers," Ms. Hindle of Stack Overflow said. "Technology is not slowing down. They're still struggling with how to fill that gap, with that need for tech talent."
Before joining the e-commerce platform Shopify as a developer in 2020, Josh Larson reviewed the company's tech blog, which is designed for engineers and data scientists. "It gives you a glimpse into the tooling that's being used," he said. "Are they using modern stuff? Do they have an up-to-date blog, or was it last updated three years ago?" His future employer passed the test.
Two years later, he was one of the authors behind those blog posts. (Mr. Larson has an unfair advantage: He studied journalism in college.) In June, he published "How We Built Hydrogen: A React Framework for Building Custom Storefronts," a behind-the-scenes look at how Shopify built a new set of tools for developers. Even at 2,500 words, it has become one of the year's most popular blog posts on the site, delving into how Shopify used customer feedback to improve its product.
It's a good example of why Shopify's tech blog has become an industry success story. Annual traffic topped one million views in 2022 -- up 56 percent since 2021, according to the company -- suggesting that, when done well, there's a significant audience interested in this kind of information.
"The thing you hear time and time again about writing, on the internet especially, is, 'It's already been written about' or 'I don't know what I'm talking about,"' Mr. Larson said, expressing doubts that many bloggers have certainly had before him. He encourages his fellow engineers not to get disheartened. "Your perspective will be helpful to other people, he said, adding, "Just don't be afraid to share what you learned."

NEW YORK — In the middle of the pandemic, my wife and I moved to Manhattan from Brooklyn. There would be less space for Gerda, our husky, but no more 45-minute car commutes and no more road rage. I would walk everywhere. And I would take Gerda with me.
Those first morning walks were exciting for both of us. As we rounded the island’s southern tip, I admired the view of the Brooklyn Bridge as Gerda lunged at scraps of food. But soon, the charms of the garbage-strewn plaza in front of the Staten Island Ferry started to wear off, and the 1980s architecture of Battery Park City seemed to take on a generic look. With so much to sniff, Gerda was content, but I felt the need to fill the hours with something that would drown out the city noise and occupy my brain.
A friend recommended “Red Scare,” a cultural commentary podcast, pointing out that it was hosted by two self-described “bohemian layabouts” from the former Soviet Union, Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. Since I’m from Belarus, my friend thought the show would speak to me.
When I was 15, my family left the Soviet Union as political refugees fleeing antisemitism. I made it through the local public high schools and a mediocre business college that left me with more student debt than knowledge, before I finally learned something while getting a master’s degree at a liberal university. Each of my 30 years in America had gradually chipped away at my once-rosy view of my adopted home as I battled my way out of poverty, material and spiritual.
Politically, I was on the left, the Marxist teachings of my Soviet youth only strengthened by the injustices I saw during my formative years in the United States. But in the past several years, I’ve come to feel lonely on the political spectrum, finding moments of sanity in conversations with friends, rather than in publications that seem to favor opinion-driven pandering. Still, I looked to the news media for a reality check, hoping that someone out there must have a clue. But where do you find sanity in an insane world?
When I started listening to “Red Scare” on my walks with Gerda, I felt like I had found a refreshing critique of the increasingly polarized political landscape. While situating themselves on the left, Khachiyan and Nekrasova didn’t shy away from calling out the excesses of so-called progressivism. They waded into the culture wars, highlighting the absurdity and cynicism of corporate media while emphasizing that the poor always seemed to get fleeced in the end.
The hosts went after the political naivete of some leftists and criticized slogans such as “Defund the Police,” noting that the police were more often than not from lower-middle-class and minority backgrounds. Khachiyan spoke highly of “The Culture of Narcissism” by Christopher Lasch, one of my favorite books.
On my rounds with Gerda, I came to think that the hosts shared a mature, European sensibility to go with a certain wisdom common to immigrants who have grown up without privilege and are able to see America with some clarity.
I wasn’t the only one enthralled with “Red Scare.” Patreon reports that it has roughly 12,000 supporters who collectively donate nearly $53,000 a month. Part of the show’s appeal has nothing to do with politics. Mixed into their dissections of current events, the hosts frequently discuss shopping, beauty regimens and bits of celebrity gossip. The show’s popularity is probably helped by the celebrity of Nekrasova, an actress who has appeared on “Succession.”
More often than not, I nodded along as I listened to back episodes. Gerda and I started spending more time on our walks, much to her delight, and my headphones discouraged strangers from trying to engage me in mind-numbing doggy chitchat. To celebrate her new outdoorsy lifestyle, Gerda took NASCAR-style laps around the dog run, chasing off the males who tried to hump her.
But somewhere along the way, the podcast began to grate on me. Maybe it was when Khachiyan offered a defense of Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager who fatally shot two men and wounded another during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Wisconsin. (Rittenhouse was acquitted of criminal charges in 2021.) And it didn’t sit well with me when Khachiyan questioned the efficacy of vaccines in the efforts to curb COVID-19, describing herself as becoming “an even more conservative COVID truther.”
Although “Red Scare” had played host to favorites of the so-called dirtbag left — Slavoj Zizek, Adam Curtis and John Waters — a guest in November 2021 was Alex Jones, founder of the misinformation website Infowars and a prominent conspiracy theorist who described the killings of 27 people, including 20 children, at the Sandy Hook Elementary School as a hoax.
The hosts were apparently trying to rehabilitate his reputation, asking him softball questions such as “Do you feel like a caricature that the liberal media made you out to be?” A photo posted on Nekrasova’s Instagram account at the time of the interview shows the two hosts on either side of a smiling Jones, with Nekrasova’s arm around him. (Late last year, Jones was ordered by a court to pay the victims’ families nearly $1.5 billion in damages.)
Khachiyan declined to comment about the apparent shift when I contacted her via email for this essay. Nekrasova did not reply to requests for comment. In a 2019 interview with The Face, the hosts complained about critics who have likened them to “crypto-fascists.” “The idea that we’re somehow dangerous or influencing discourse in a toxic way is unfair and misguided,” Nekrasova said. Her co-host added, “We are two chicks with an entertainment radio show that you can voluntarily opt in or out of. We’re not policymakers or political figures.”
Increasingly, I was dismayed by what I was hearing. Did they truly believe what they were saying? Was it a function of being children of Russian-speaking immigrants, whose conservatism, often tinged with racism and anti-socialist sentiment, is commonplace and one of the reasons I couldn’t wait to get out of my old Brooklyn neighborhood?
On it went, along with their talk about their shopping trips and spa routines. Worst of all was the careless spouting of increasingly provocative and unsubstantiated views. I found myself stopping 20 minutes into each episode, wondering why I was wasting my time. As I fumbled with my phone, Gerda looked at me judgmentally for interrupting our walks.
One day, a “Red Scare” episode notification popped up on my phone. I hit the little x . Then I deleted the podcast.
Since then I’ve been mostly listening to music, which allows me to spend time with my thoughts as we navigate the narrow downtown streets. Gerda doesn’t seem to mind, as long as she has something to sniff. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Just What Do McCarthy’s Antagonists Want, and Why Won’t They Budge?

As the Republicans’ drama over Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s bid to become House speaker persists for round after round of negotiations and roll-call votes, one puzzling question is just what, exactly, the rebels want.
To the endless frustration of McCarthy and his allies, the insurgents’ demands have been heavy on two factors: internal procedural rules meant to expand the power of the far right within the House, and the insurgents’ desire to present themselves as uncompromising foes of Democrats’ agenda. But more than anything else, McCarthy’s most die-hard opponents just seem intent on taking him down.
“It’s not about policies, it’s about the fight,” said Doug Heye, a former aide to Rep. Eric Cantor, the onetime majority leader who lost his seat in a stunning 2014 upset by a far-right challenger, David Brat. “The more you hear the word ‘fight’ or ‘fighter,’ the less you hear about a strategy for winning that fight.”
The longer the speaker battle has dragged on, the more McCarthy’s supporters have expressed exasperation at this state of affairs. Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas accused the holdouts of mouthing “stupid platitudes that some consultant told you to say on the campaign trail.” Rep. Don Bacon, who holds a swing seat in Nebraska, has taken to calling them “the chaos caucus” and the “Taliban 20.”
Such strident language isn’t new: Rep. John Boehner, who was hounded out of the speakership in 2015 by the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, later lashed out at one of its co-founders, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, as a “political terrorist” and a “jerk.” (Jordan is now backing McCarthy, and is set to run the powerful Judiciary Committee if and when the speaker fight is resolved.)
Fueled by the Grassroots Right
One of the peculiarities of this speaker vote has been watching McCarthy’s team try to marshal the conservative-industrial media complex, which helped power the rise of political outsiders like Donald Trump and has steadily weakened the ability of party leaders to keep backbenchers in line.
“We’ll see what happens when Tucker and Sean Hannity and Ben Shapiro start beating up on those guys,” Rep. Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania wistfully told reporters at the Capitol this week. “Maybe that’ll move it.”
But Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, did not beat up on those guys, instead celebrating the speakership debate as “pretty refreshing.” Nor is it clear that Fox News can command the exclusive loyalties of the right. Witness how, during the Republican primary for Senate last year in Pennsylvania, a network of conservative blogs and podcasts fueled the sudden rise of Kathy Barnette, a little-known conservative media personality who was able to throw a last-minute fright into Trump and Hannity’s preferred candidate, Dr. Mehmet Oz.
“Is this a game show?” a frustrated Hannity pressed one of the House holdouts, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, on his Fox News show on Wednesday night. She didn’t back down.
Chris Stirewalt, a former editor at Fox News, said that “what happens online, on talk radio and on Fox prime time has been and will continue to be the harbinger of what House Republicans will do.” He added that the representatives and congressional aides he was speaking with were “all talking about how their positions were playing with the different hosts and sites.”
So far, the major Fox hosts have stuck with McCarthy. But “there could be a land rush,” Stirewalt said, if “certain hosts or outlets are seen to be benefiting by being more extreme.”
Those kinds of incentives have helped to atrophy Republican leaders’ usual tools of maintaining discipline. Most committee assignments promise a congressional life of thankless drudgery, especially when your political ideology is oriented around stopping government action.
Some of the loudest conservative lawmakers now find it more appealing to become instant celebrities, and can afford to spurn McCarthy’s offers of congressional perks and the K Street-connected money spigot and tap into the fury of grassroots Republican donors instead.
Remember Madison Cawthorn? Before his fall from grace, the North Carolina representative rocketed onto the national political scene by tossing out red meat and racking up hits on Trump-friendly news outlets. Time magazine reported in 2021 that Cawthorn had informed colleagues, “I have built my staff around comms rather than legislation.”
Boehner once described the cycle as “getting elected, make a lot of noise, draw a lot of attention to yourself, raise a lot of money, which means you’re going to go make more noise, raise more money.”
This week, a nonaggression pact was struck between the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC close to McCarthy that spent more than $200 million to elect Republicans to House seats this year, and the Club for Growth, a conservative outside group that specializes in trying to unseat incumbents who are deemed too squishy.
That agreement served as an equally emphatic statement of where the real power lies in the Republican Party: outside its formal structures.
‘I Didn’t Know What Conservative Was’
A New York Times review of the 20 lawmakers who have consistently voted against McCarthy found that 12 of them had denied the results of the 2020 election, 19 were linked to the Freedom Caucus and 17 were endorsed by Trump in last year’s midterms.
Most of the rebels hail from deep-red districts. But not all of them.
Rep.-elect Josh Brecheen, who was elected last year in Oklahoma, won his race by 49 percentage points. Three others won by at least 40, four of them won by 30 or more, and three carried their districts by margins in the 20s. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona ran unopposed.
But that doesn’t explain the actions of someone like Boebert, who survived a surprisingly vigorous challenge by about 500 votes. Three others — Eli Crane, Anna Paulina Luna and Scott Perry — won their races by just 8 points.
More than any other trait, what defines the rebels is personality-driven politics. For these bomb-throwers, winning plaudits in the alternative conservative news ecosystem is the point.
“A lot of these people get into Congress and they get drunk on the red light of the camera,” said Alice Stewart, a Republican communications consultant.
“Conservative media stars need to recognize our opposition is Biden and the Democrats, not our fellow Republicans,” she added.
Paulina Luna, a newly elected Air Force veteran and Instagram influencer with nearly 500,000 followers, once confessed on her podcast, “I know this sounds weird, but I didn’t know what conservative was.”
Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman who has practically turned his opposition to McCarthy into a reality show, has clearly relished the attention. The introductory montage to his podcast, “Firebrand,” includes clips of Carlson praising him as “one of the very few members in Congress who bothered to stand up against permanent Washington” and of Trump saying: “Ever watch this guy on television? He’s like a machine.”
On Wednesday, as McCarthy scrambled to cut new deals that might win over his antagonists, Gaetz sent out a fundraising appeal. The text message said he was “leading the fight to elect a true conservative” as speaker.
“I’m fighting for you,” it continued, “and I need you to have my back like never before.”
Then, on Thursday, not long after Steve Bannon proposed Trump as a consensus candidate on his podcast, Gaetz proudly announced his pick for speaker on the House floor: Donald John Trump. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Data Breach Has Lessons for Us All: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The hacking of the password manager should make us reassess whether to trust companies to store our sensitive data in the cloud.
While many of us were unplugging from the internet to spend time with loved ones over the holidays, LastPass, the maker of a popular security program for managing digital passwords, delivered the most unwanted gift. It published details about a recent security breach in which cybercriminals had obtained copies of customers' password vaults, potentially exposing millions of people's online information.
From a hacker's perspective, this is the equivalent of hitting the jackpot.
When you use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password, it stores a list containing all of the user names and passwords for the sites and apps you use, including banking, health care, email and social networking accounts. It keeps track of that list, called the vault, in its online cloud so you have easy access to your passwords from any device. LastPass said hackers had stolen copies of the list of user names and passwords of every customer from the company's servers.
This breach was one of the worst things that could happen to a security product designed to take care of your passwords. But other than the obvious next step -- to change all of your passwords if you used LastPass -- there are important lessons that we can learn from this debacle, including that security products are not foolproof, especially when they store our sensitive data in the cloud.
First, it's important to understand what happened: The company said intruders had gained access to its cloud database and obtained a copy of the data vaults of tens of millions of customers by using credentials and keys stolen from a LastPass employee.
LastPass, which published details about the breach in a blog post on Dec. 22, tried to reassure its users that their information was probably safe. It said that some parts of people's vaults -- like the website addresses for the sites they logged in to -- were unencrypted, but that sensitive data, including user names and passwords, were encrypted. This would suggest that hackers could know the banking website someone used but not have the user name and password required to log into that person's account.
Most important, the master passwords that users set up for unlocking their LastPass vaults were also encrypted. That means hackers would then have to crack the encrypted master passwords to get the rest of the passwords in each vault, which would be difficult to do so long as people used a unique, complex master password.
Karim Toubba, the chief executive of LastPass, declined to be interviewed but wrote in an emailed statement that the incident demonstrated the strength of the company's system architecture, which he said kept sensitive vault data encrypted and secured. He also said it was users' responsibility to "practice good password hygiene."
Many security experts disagreed with Mr. Toubba's optimistic spin and said every LastPass user should change all of his or her passwords.
"It is very serious," said Sinan Eren, an executive at Barracuda, a security firm. "I would consider all those managed passwords compromised."
Casey Ellis, the chief technology officer of the security firm Bugcrowd, said it was significant that intruders had access to the lists of website addresses that people used.
"Let's say I'm coming after you," Mr. Ellis said. "I can look at all the websites you have saved information for and use that to plan an attack. Every LastPass user has that data now in the hands of an adversary."
Here are the lessons we can all learn from this breach to stay safer online.
Prevention is better than treatment.
The LastPass breach is a reminder that it is easier to set up safeguards for our most sensitive accounts before a breach occurs than to try to protect ourselves afterward. Here are some best practices we should all follow for our passwords; any LastPass user who had taken these steps ahead of time would have been relatively safe during this recent breach.
Create a complex, unique password for every account. A strong password should be long and difficult for someone to guess. For example, take these sentences: "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." And convert them into this, using initials for each word and an exclamation point for the I's: "Mn!!m.Ykmf.Ptd."
For those using a password manager, this rule of thumb is of paramount importance for the master password to unlock your vault. Never reuse this password for any other app or site.
For your most sensitive accounts, add an extra layer of security with two-factor authentication. This setting involves generating a temporary code that must be entered in addition to your user name and password before you can log into your accounts.
Most banking sites let you set up your cellphone number or email address to receive a message containing a temporary code to log in. Some apps, like Twitter and Instagram, let you use so-called authenticator apps like Google Authenticator and Authy to generate temporary codes.
But remember, it's not your fault.
Let's clarify one big thing: Whenever any company's servers are breached and customer data is stolen, it's the company's fault for failing to protect you.
LastPass's public response to the incident thrusts responsibility on the user, but we don't have to accept that. Although it's true that practicing "good password hygiene" would have helped to keep an account more secure in a breach, that doesn't absolve the company of responsibility.
There are risks to the cloud.
Though the breach of LastPass may feel damning, password managers in general are a useful tool because they make it more convenient to generate and store complex and unique passwords for our many internet accounts.
Internet security often involves weighing convenience versus risk. Mr. Ellis of Bugcrowd said the challenge with password security was that whenever the best practices were too complicated, people would default to whatever was easier -- for example, using easily guessable passwords and repeating them across sites.
So don't write off password managers. But remember that the LastPass breach demonstrates that you are always taking a risk when entrusting a company with storing your sensitive data in its cloud, as convenient as it is to have your password vault accessible on any of your devices.
Mr. Eren of Barracuda recommends not using password managers that store the database on their cloud and instead choosing one that stores your password vault on your own devices, like KeePass.
Have an exit strategy.
That brings us to my final piece of advice, which can be applied to any online service: Always have a plan for pulling out your data -- in this case, your password vault -- in the event that something happens that makes you want to leave.
For LastPass, the company lists steps on its website to export a copy of your vault into a spreadsheet. Then you can import that list of passwords into a different password manager. Or you can keep the spreadsheet file for yourself, stored somewhere safe and convenient for you to use.
I take a hybrid approach. I use a password manager that does not store my data in its cloud. Instead, I keep my own copy of my vault on my computer and in a cloud drive that I control myself. You could do this by using a cloud service such as iCloud or Dropbox. Those methods aren't foolproof, either, but they are less likely than a company's database to be targeted by hackers.

Seeking Stability, Red Sox Decide Devers Is a Keeper: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "We want to build around him," Chaim Bloom, Boston's chief baseball officer, said of Rafael Devers, the star third baseman who is working to finalize a $ 331 million deal.
A team of athletes marched into Fenway Park wearing Boston Red Sox uniforms on Monday morning. They played a game and won, beating a team owned by John Henry, who also owns the Red Sox.
Confused? It was just another day in the bewildering off-season of Major League Baseball's most puzzling franchise, which swerved again this week from frustration to elation.
The game on Monday was the N.H.L.'s Winter Classic, and the Boston Bruins defeated the Henry-owned Pittsburgh Penguins, 2-1. Both teams wore baseball uniforms to the ballpark, and when Henry arrived, a fan on Van Ness Street, along the stadium's first base line, spotted him in the parking lot and cried, "Pay Raffy!" Henry -- whose ever-expanding sports portfolio had seemed to dampen his enthusiasm for spending on the Red Sox -- may have listened.
Rafael Devers, Boston's star third baseman, was said to be in the process of finalizing an 11-year, $ 331 million contract extension with the Red Sox on Wednesday. The agreement was first reported by the former major leaguer Carlos Baerga on Instagram. The deal would provide a jolt of optimism amid a dreary winter for a team coming off a dizzying decade: five playoff appearances, five seasons finishing at least 15 games out of first place in the American League East.
Devers, 26, is the last remaining position player from Boston's 2018 championship roster. Shortstop Xander Bogaerts left for the San Diego Padres in free agency last month, and other homegrown starters, like Mookie Betts, the 2018 A.L. most valuable player, Andrew Benintendi, and Christian Vázquez, were shipped off in trades.
In a phone interview on Wednesday morning, Chaim Bloom, the team's chief baseball officer, explained why the time was right to make a long-term commitment to Devers -- and why it wasn't quite right to do so with the others.
"We absolutely want to keep him here and we want to build around him, and I know we've had players in recent history that we've felt that way about and it didn't work out," Bloom said.
"The difference now is when you're making those bets, it's not just about the talent of the player, it's also about the positioning of the organization and are you well positioned to back up the bet? Are you well positioned to have the foundation around that core piece that will allow you to maximize the prime years of the player? And simply put, I just think we're much better set up for that right now than we were a few years ago."
It is impossible to know precisely how long-term deals with Betts and Bogaerts -- or other free agents the Red Sox did not explore -- could have altered the team's long-term outlook. But Betts and Bogaerts are four years older than Devers, and Bloom believes the timeline matches up better with Devers, whose prime may coincide longer with Boston's next glory era.
Then again, predicting the Red Sox' fortunes has been vexing for years. After a last-place finish in 2012, they signed some midlevel free agents and won the 2013 World Series. After two more last-place seasons, they won three division titles in a row, culminating in the 2018 World Series title.
A mediocre follow-up season led Henry to fire Dave Dombrowski, a probable Hall of Fame executive who specializes in building through acquiring superstars. The hiring of Bloom, who had been a top official with the thrifty and successful Tampa Bay Rays, a division rival, seemed to signal a shift in philosophy.
Bloom insisted that isn't quite right. He believed the Red Sox needed to make hard decisions without tearing down completely -- that is, try to contend without being reckless and weakening the future. His three seasons have reflected the range of outcomes for that kind of strategy: last place in 2020, a surprise visit to the American League Championship Series in 2021, and last place again in 2022.
"Rewind the clock three years, to when I got here," Bloom said. "You had a club that obviously was coming off a lot of recent success, but clearly was not in a position where it was at or anywhere near the top of the division anymore. The talent wasn't close in the farm system to replenish that roster, and there were quite a few commitments on the books. That's not a great position to be in.
"And, really, the strategy all along has been to reset the table for a run of extended success, but to try to do it in a way where we were winning while we were doing it. There's no question it's a heavier lift to try to serve both masters. We were able to do it in 2021. Obviously in '22, for a number of reasons, it didn't work. But the way you do that is by maintaining elements of that core while replenishing the organization as much as you can with young talent. We have some of those young guys who are coming -- some of them are going to play really prominent roles in '23 -- and there's more coming behind that.
"If you continue taking on massive commitment after massive commitment, you never really get out of treading water around those."
The Red Sox have largely avoided such deals lately. Officially, they have only three players signed beyond 2024: pitcher Garrett Whitlock, infielder Trevor Story and outfielder Masataka Yoshida, who signed last month for five years and $ 90 million after a decorated career in Japan.
Their other deals this winter have been risk-averse: two years each for infielder Justin Turner and the right-handed relievers Kenley Jansen and Chris Martin, and one year for the right-handed starter Corey Kluber and the lefty reliever Joely Rodríguez. The team hopes that three young pitchers -- Whitlock, Tanner Houck and Brayan Bello -- can establish themselves in the rotation, but the veteran starters -- Kluber, Chris Sale, James Paxton, Nick Pivetta -- offer little certainty.
The 2023 outlook would be different had the Red Sox made a stronger offer to Bogaerts before free agency or matched the Padres' winning bid (11 years, $ 280 million). They could have moved aggressively on another choice from a deep class of free agents. Their passivity made you wonder if Henry simply didn't want to pay the going rate for superstars anymore.
Would the Red Sox make those kinds of investments again? Bloom emphasized on Wednesday morning that they would.
"Absolutely -- when it aligns with winning," he said. "The end point is winning. It's not commitments for their own sake. It's commitments that you can win with. As we see, you win with these when they're part of a complete team and complete organization. With every move, whether it's a waiver claim or a large, multiyear contract, the endpoint is always: is this going to help us deliver to our fans what we're here to deliver, which is winning baseball on an annual basis? And if the answer is yes, it's something we should pursue."
The Red Sox have passed on a lot of those options. They won't be anyone's favorite in the A.L. East. But a deal for Devers is a strong sign that a stubbornly pragmatic front office believes in its long-term direction.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
While many of us were unplugging from the internet to spend time with loved ones over the holidays, LastPass, the maker of a popular security program for managing digital passwords, delivered the most unwanted gift. It published details about a recent security breach in which cybercriminals had obtained copies of customers’ password vaults, potentially exposing millions of people’s online information.
From a hacker’s perspective, this is the equivalent of hitting the jackpot.
When you use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password, it stores a list containing all of the user names and passwords for the sites and apps you use, including banking, health care, email and social networking accounts. It keeps track of that list, called the vault, in its online cloud so you have easy access to your passwords from any device. LastPass said hackers had stolen copies of the list of user names and passwords of every customer from the company’s servers.
This breach was one of the worst things that could happen to a security product designed to take care of your passwords. But other than the obvious next step — to change all of your passwords if you used LastPass — there are important lessons that we can learn from this debacle, including that security products are not foolproof, especially when they store our sensitive data in the cloud.
First, it’s important to understand what happened: The company said intruders had gained access to its cloud database and obtained a copy of the data vaults of tens of millions of customers by using credentials and keys stolen from a LastPass employee.
LastPass, which published details about the breach in a blog post Dec. 22, tried to reassure its users that their information was probably safe. It said that some parts of people’s vaults — like the website addresses for the sites they logged in to — were unencrypted but that sensitive data, including user names and passwords, were encrypted. This would suggest that hackers could know the banking website someone used but not have the user name and password required to log in to that person’s account.
Most importantly, the master passwords that users set up for unlocking their LastPass vaults were also encrypted. That means hackers would then have to crack the encrypted master passwords to get the rest of the passwords in each vault, which would be difficult to do, so long as people used a unique, complex master password.
Karim Toubba, CEO of LastPass, declined to be interviewed but wrote in an emailed statement that the incident demonstrated the strength of the company’s system architecture, which he said kept sensitive vault data encrypted and secured. He also said it was users’ responsibility to “practice good password hygiene.”
Many security experts disagreed with Toubba’s optimistic spin and said every LastPass user should change all of his or her passwords.
“It is very serious,” said Sinan Eren, an executive at Barracuda, a security firm. “I would consider all those managed passwords compromised.”
Casey Ellis, the chief technology officer of the security firm Bugcrowd, said it was significant that intruders had access to the lists of website addresses that people used.
“Let’s say I’m coming after you,” Ellis said. “I can look at all the websites you have saved information for and use that to plan an attack. Every LastPass user has that data now in the hands of an adversary.”
Here are the lessons we can all learn from this breach to stay safer online.
Prevention is better than treatment.
The LastPass breach is a reminder that it is easier to set up safeguards for our most sensitive accounts before a breach occurs than to try to protect ourselves afterward. Here are some best practices we should all follow for our passwords; any LastPass user who had taken these steps ahead of time would have been relatively safe during this recent breach.
— Create a complex, unique password for every account. A strong password should be long and difficult for someone to guess. For example, take these sentences: “My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.” And convert them into this, using initials for each word and an exclamation point for the I’s: “Mn!!m.Ykmf.Ptd.”
For those using a password manager, this rule of thumb is of paramount importance for the master password to unlock your vault. Never reuse this password for any other app or site.
— For your most sensitive accounts, add an extra layer of security with two-factor authentication. This setting involves generating a temporary code that must be entered in addition to your user name and password before you can log into your accounts.
Most banking sites let you set up your cellphone number or email address to receive a message containing a temporary code to log in. Some apps, like Twitter and Instagram, let you use so-called authenticator apps like Google Authenticator and Authy to generate temporary codes.
But remember, it’s not your fault.
Let’s clarify one big thing: Whenever any company’s servers are breached and customer data is stolen, it’s the company’s fault for failing to protect you.
LastPass’s public response to the incident thrusts responsibility on the user, but we don’t have to accept that. Although it’s true that practicing “good password hygiene” would have helped to keep an account more secure in a breach, that doesn’t absolve the company of responsibility.
There are risks to the cloud.
Although the breach of LastPass may feel damning, password managers in general are a useful tool because they make it more convenient to generate and store complex and unique passwords for our many internet accounts.
Internet security often involves weighing convenience versus risk. Ellis of Bugcrowd said the challenge with password security was that whenever the best practices were too complicated, people would default to whatever was easier — for example, using easily guessable passwords and repeating them across sites.
So don’t write off password managers. But remember that the LastPass breach demonstrates that you are always taking a risk when entrusting a company with storing your sensitive data in its cloud, as convenient as it is to have your password vault accessible on any of your devices.
Eren of Barracuda recommends not using password managers that store the database on their cloud and instead choosing one that stores your password vault on your own devices, like KeePass.
Have an exit strategy.
That brings us to my final piece of advice, which can be applied to any online service: Always have a plan for pulling out your data — in this case, your password vault — in the event that something happens that makes you want to leave.
For LastPass, the company lists steps on its website to export a copy of your vault into a spreadsheet. Then you can import that list of passwords into a different password manager. Or you can keep the spreadsheet file for yourself, stored somewhere safe and convenient for you to use.
I take a hybrid approach. I use a password manager that does not store my data in its cloud. Instead, I keep my own copy of my vault on my computer and in a cloud drive that I control myself. You could do this by using a cloud service such as iCloud or Dropbox. Those methods aren’t foolproof, either, but they are less likely than a company’s database to be targeted by hackers.

Salesforce to Lay Off 10% of Staff and Cut Office Space: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The software company plans to cut around 8,000 jobs as business slows for tech companies. "We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn," Salesforce's chief executive said.
Salesforce, the business software giant, said on Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 8,000 employees, and scale back office space because of concerns about the economy.
"The environment remains challenging, and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions," Marc Benioff, the company's co-chief executive, said in a note to employees announcing the cuts.
Salesforce's revenue, like that of many other technology companies, boomed during the pandemic when more people around the world worked from home and relied more heavily on technology to collaborate with colleagues remotely. In his letter, Mr. Benioff suggested that the company had hired too aggressively during that period.
Salesforce employed just under 80,000 people at the end of October, up from about 48,000 three years earlier.
"We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that," Mr. Benioff said.
A Salesforce spokeswoman said the company had no further comment on the cuts.
The layoffs cast the tech industry's slowdown into even sharper relief. In recent months, tech giants like Amazon have slowed down hiring and cut jobs, while smaller companies like Lyft and Stripe have also announced layoffs. Many of the industry's largest firms have reported financial results suggesting they were feeling the effects of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies have struggled with a pullback in digital advertising in particular. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, cut 13 percent of its employees in November and said its head count would remain "roughly flat" through the end of this year. Snap, Snapchat's parent company, laid off 20 percent of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions. Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $ 44 billion in October, has slashed the company's work force by more than half.
Salesforce's sales grew 14 percent in its latest quarter, the slowest pace in years; it projected even slower growth in its current quarter. Other tech chiefs, like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, have recently admitted to hiring too many people as they rushed to make cuts. More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts.
In November, Bret Taylor, Salesforce's co-chief executive, announced that he would resign from his post and leave at the end of this month. In December, Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, also said he would leave his position by the end of this month. Salesforce bought Slack for $ 27.7 billion in 2020.
Salesforce is the largest private employer in San Francisco, and its flagship office building is the city's tallest.
The company estimated that the changes would cost up to $ 2.1 billion. Salesforce is offering U.S. employees a minimum of five months of pay, as well as health insurance and career resources, Mr. Benioff said. Most of the cuts will be made "over the coming weeks," he wrote.
Salesforce's shares rose more than 3 percent in trading on Wednesday. The company's stock price fell nearly 50 percent last year.

Iran Releases Prominent Actress Who Supported Protests: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Taraneh Alidoosti, one of the most high-profile targets in Iran's campaign against celebrities who have expressed solidarity with the demonstrators, was arrested on Dec. 18.
Iran released a well-known actress on Wednesday, state media reported, after she spent two and a half weeks in detention for condemning the government's harsh response to the mass protests that have upended the country since September.
The actress, Taraneh Alidoosti, 38, was arrested on Dec. 18 after urging Iranians to support the anti-government protests, becoming one of the most high-profile targets in Iran's campaign against sports stars, rappers, filmmakers, actors and other celebrities who have expressed solidarity with the demonstrators.
On Wednesday, Iran's semiofficial ISNA news agency said Ms. Alidoosti, the star of the Academy Award-winning 2016 film "The Salesman," directed by Asghar Farhadi, was released on bail, citing her lawyer, Zahra Minouie.
Photos later circulated on social media that appeared to show Ms. Alidoosti standing outside Evin Prison, the infamous facility in Tehran where Iran routinely locks up political opponents, academics, writers and other prominent dissidents. Her hair was loosely covered with a scarf and she held a bunch of flowers.
The protests first swept across Iran in mid-September after the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by Iran's morality police, accused of violating the law mandating head scarves and modest dress for women. Though the protests at first focused on dismantling the hijab law, they quickly broadened to demand an end to Iran's entire ruling establishment.
As the authorities cracked down with bullets and beatings, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of arrests, Ms. Alidoosti became one of the most famous voices cheering on the protests and denouncing the brutal response.
"Your silence means supporting oppression and oppressors," Ms. Alidoosti wrote on her social media accounts in December, after the authorities announced the execution by hanging of Mohsen Shekari, 23, one of two protesters Iran has executed so far.
In reporting her arrest, state news agencies described her posts as "unsubstantiated comments about recent events" and "the publication of provocative material." The judiciary said in a statement that it had summoned several celebrities, including Ms. Alidoosti, for posting claims it said were unproven about what the government calls the "riots," but that because she had not offered any evidence, she was arrested.
Ms. Alidoosti, who was also prosecuted in June 2020 for Twitter posts criticizing the police for assaulting an Iranian woman who had taken off her head scarf, had previously posted a photo of herself with her hair uncovered, holding a sign signaling her support for the protesters.
When she was arrested, however, her Twitter and Instagram accounts were taken down. Those accounts remained unavailable on Wednesday evening.
Iran's government blames the protests on a conspiracy by foreign countries, and it has remained defiant in the face of international condemnation. The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a meeting with hundreds of Iranian women on Wednesday that Westerners were "hypocritical" for criticizing the place of women in Islam while oppressing women in their own countries.
"The modernized West and its decadent culture are really guilty in this regard and have committed a crime against women's honor and dignity," he said, according to ISNA, while defending Islam's "advanced" and "just" view on women.

Unexpected Joy In Canned Beans: [Letter]

Full text: Consider composting and using up all those leftovers in the refrigerator.
On New Year's Day I finally tidied up under the kitchen sink to prepare for the overdue repatriation of my compost bucket. Before the pandemic, my family composted regularly. Each week, we'd draw straws to see who had to lug the leaky biodegradable bags to a drop-off site several blocks away. Then the pandemic lockdown closed the site, and we exiled the bucket to the basement. A break from drippy bags! I planned to bring up the bucket as soon as composting resumed. But when it did, you know, someone had a cold; the furnace conked out; I had a work deadline. The months ticked by.
But Susan Shain's recent article for The Times has jolted me back into my composting groove. She wrote about how an Ohio community substantially reduced its food waste, which is a huge contributor to greenhouse gases and responsible for twice as many emissions as commercial aviation in the United States. That's a lot of emissions.
Households, she writes, "account for 39 percent of food waste in the United States, more than restaurants, grocery stores or farms. Change, then, means tackling the hard-wired habits of hundreds of millions of individuals, community by community, home by home."
The statistics left me nowhere to hide. What we do in the kitchen can make a difference: creating meal plans, shopping with a list, composting and using up the leftovers.
This last one is my happy place. I turn it into a game, saving bits of this and that in little containers, then puzzling out how to use them to seed future meals.
That handful of sautéed kale, those roasted vegetables, a tranche of salmon fillet? Chop it all up and fold it into a creamy risotto for color and flavor, or make a base for a loaded frittata (above).
Half-wilted bunches of cilantro or parsley and bags of baby arugula or spinach can find homes in all kinds of soups, like a lemony turkey and white bean soup, or pasta dishes like a pantry-friendly midnight pasta. Sturdy salads -- cucumber or, say, yesterday's takeout green papaya -- will work as a topping for any rice bowl, including sesame salmon and katsudon (pork cutlet bowls, so beloved in the anime series, "Yuri!!! On Ice").
If you have a motley band of root vegetables softening in your produce drawer, perhaps from an overenthusiastic spree at the farmers' market or a surprise bonanza from your CSA box, you can upcycle them into a warming, adaptable vegetable soup. Enlist your wilted or leftover greens; rutabagas, turnips and kohlrabi, come on in!
As for leftover dessert, a batch of brookies or bread pudding (made from stale bread). Let's just say this is never an issue in my sweet-toothed family. We gleefully finish every crumb.

Now, one of the great re-users of the last century was the artist Joseph Cornell. He would raid thrift shops and used bookstores for items that he felt had a special magic -- often toys or images of children of the past -- and then alchemize them into assemblages, like his art series "Medici Slot Machine." They are far greater than the sum of their parts, and every time I see a Cornell box, I feel that upcycling can overcome the work of time, for a while.
Sam's back on Friday, and I'll see you here on Monday.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New options in the quiet Brooklyn neighborhood are worth checking out.
A few months back I ran into a former co-worker and his partner, and I asked him that age-old question: "What neighborhood do you live in again?" His response: "Well, we're a long-term couple in our mid-30s, so Park Slope."
Park Slope's reputation as one of Brooklyn's premier social retirement communities persists for a reason: It's tree-lined, rich in strollers and almost suburban, and though the neighborhood has long been home to some fantastic restaurants -- Al di la Trattoria, Haenyeo, Miriam, Fonda -- new dining options don't tend to open there as frequently as they do in, say, the East Village or Crown Heights. But little by little, that is changing.
Four Courses for a Bargain
I'd say a transformation began with the cafe and bakery Winner, which opened in March 2020 and quickly became what Pete Wells called his "ideal pandemic restaurant" for serving an ideal pandemic meal: the rotisserie chicken "brushed with smoked honey and rounded out with a pound or so of roasted potatoes, some braised kale and a noticeably fresh sourdough baguette."
Much has been said about that rotisserie chicken, but not so much about Winner's sister restaurant Runner Up, where the menu, which takes some inspiration from fine dining, changes week to week. That means crudos, potato croquettes with trout roe and a strong wine list, but nothing too fancy. A recent change: Through March, the 12-seat restaurant is serving a $ 60, four-course prix-fixe dinner at the bar, which is pretty affordable as far as prix-fixe meals in this city go. That's perfect for a night when you've got a sitter -- or just want a really nice meal.
An Important Restaurant Group Arrives
Another sure sign that your neighborhood's dining reputation might be changing: a major restaurant group setting up shop. Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya's Unapologetic Foods is best known for its popular restaurants in Manhattan, including Semma and Dhamaka. Park Slope has the distinction of being the first Brooklyn neighborhood with a restaurant from the group. The focus at Masalawala & Sons is East Indian home cooking, specifically that of the seaside city Kolkata. (Mr. Mazumdar's father, Satyen, who grew up there, is the restaurant's manager and the older gentleman shown on its menu.)
Like its predecessors, Masalawala & Sons is nearly impossible to get into (though the patio is reserved for walk-ins) but if you manage to snag a table inside, expect seafood like tiger prawns served in a coconut, and biyebarir, fish fried in a rich, buttery batter and smothered in cilantro and chile. (You'll find lamb, chicken and some vegan and vegetarian options as well.) There's also a small Indian grocery in the restaurant if you're looking to do some shopping.
When You Can't Get Into the Hot New Spot
There are other newcomers of note if you can't get into Masalawala & Sons. Alma Negra, on Fourth Avenue, is serving Mexican food in a style not unlike that at nearby Claro. Lore, a fusion-leaning restaurant on Seventh Avenue with dishes like lamb meatballs with aji amarillo and sea bream ssam, also looks promising.
And then there's Bangkok Degree, a spinoff of the beloved Thai restaurant Dek Sen in Elmhurst, Queens (unfortunately now closed). Located down the street from the Park Slope Food Coop, Bangkok Degree has favorites like massaman curry (one version includes some very nontraditional prime rib), pad Thai and drunken noodles available for lunch and dinner. But it's the "traditional grandma dishes" section of the menu that shines. What do Thai grandmothers enjoy? Pork belly with ginger and peanuts, egg noodles in curry chicken broth and a classic tom yum soup, of course. Not such a bad way to spend one's social retirement, right?
In Other News ...
Ignacio Mattos's newest restaurant, Corner Bar, isn't particularly original, writes Pete Wells. But the classics at the chef and restaurateur's bistro inside the boutique hotel Nine Orchard are "virtually flawless."
Openings: Two Staten Island brothers bring Mediterranean flavors to Midtown Manhattan with White Olive; gluten-free and vegan barbecue comes to the Barclays Center by way of Pure Grit BBQ; and another dining option, Essex Pearl, is available to Midnight Theater patrons in the Manhattan West complex.
The Mexican restaurant El Cholo, a Los Angeles mainstay for celebrities and students, turns 100 this year. Its longevity is a testament to the loyal staff and the family behind the its traditions and flavors, writes Kevin McKenna.

New Study Links Use of Social Media To Changes in the Brains of Teenagers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Teens who frequently checked social media showed an increasing sensitivity to peer feedback, although the cause of the changes was not clear.
The effect of social media use on children is a fraught area of research, as parents and policymakers try to ascertain the results of a vast experiment already in full swing. Successive studies have added pieces to the puzzle, fleshing out the implications of a nearly constant stream of virtual interactions beginning in childhood.
A new study by neuroscientists at the University of North Carolina tries something new, conducting successive brain scans of middle schoolers between the ages of 12 and 15, a period of especially rapid brain development.
The researchers found that children who habitually checked their social media feeds at around age 12 showed a distinct trajectory, with their sensitivity to social rewards from peers heightening over time. Teenagers with less engagement in social media followed the opposite path, with a declining interest in social rewards.
The study, published on Tuesday in JAMA Pediatrics, is among the first attempts to capture changes to brain function correlated with social media use over a period of years.
The study has important limitations, the authors acknowledge. Because adolescence is a period of expanding social relationships, the brain differences could reflect a natural pivot toward peers, which could be driving more frequent social media use.
"We can't make causal claims that social media is changing the brain," said Eva H. Telzer, an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and one of the authors of the study.
But, she added, "teens who are habitually checking their social media are showing these pretty dramatic changes in the way their brains are responding, which could potentially have long-term consequences well into adulthood, sort of setting the stage for brain development over time."
A team of researchers studied an ethnically diverse group of 169 students in the sixth and seventh grades from a middle school in rural North Carolina, splitting them into groups according to how often they reported checking Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat feeds.
At around age 12, the students already showed distinct patterns of behavior. Habitual users reported checking their feeds 15 or more times a day; moderate users checked between one and 14 times; nonhabitual users checked less than once a day.
The subjects received full brain scans three times, at approximately one-year intervals, as they played a computerized game that delivered rewards and punishment in the form of smiling or scowling peers.
While carrying out the task, the frequent checkers showed increasing activation of three brain areas: reward-processing circuits, which also respond to experiences like winning money or risk-taking behavior; brain regions that determine salience, picking out what stands out in the environment; and the prefrontal cortex, which helps with regulation and control.
The results showed that "teens who grow up checking social media more often are becoming hypersensitive to feedback from their peers," Dr. Telzer said.
The findings do not capture the magnitude of the brain changes, only their trajectory. And it is unclear, authors said, whether the changes are beneficial or harmful. Social sensitivity could be adaptive, showing that the teenagers are learning to connect with others; or it could lead to social anxiety and depression if social needs are not met.
Researchers in the field of social media warned against drawing sweeping conclusions based on the findings.
"They are showing that the way you use it at one point in your life does influence the way your brain develops, but we don't know by how much, or whether it's good or bad," said Jeff Hancock, the founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab, who was not involved in the study. He said that many other variables could have contributed to these changes.
"What if these people joined a new team -- a hockey team or a volleyball team -- so started getting a lot more social interaction?" he said. It could be, he added, that the researchers are "picking up on the development of extroversion, and extroverts are more likely to check their social media."
He described the paper as "a very sophisticated piece of work," contributing to research that has emerged recently showing that sensitivity to social media varies from person to person.
"There are people who have a neurological state that means they are more likely to be attracted to checking frequently," he said. "We're not all the same, and we should stop thinking that social media is the same for everyone."
Over the last decade, social media has remapped the central experiences of adolescence, a period of rapid brain development.
Nearly all American teenagers engage through social media, with 97 percent going online every day and 46 percent reporting that they are online "almost constantly," according to the Pew Research Center. Black and Latino adolescents spend more hours on social media than their white counterparts, research has shown.
Researchers have documented a range of effects on children's mental health. Some studies have linked use of social media with depression and anxiety, while others found little connection. A 2018 study of lesbian, gay and bisexual teenagers found that social media provided them validation and support, but also exposed them to hate speech.
Experts who reviewed the study said that because the researchers measured students' social media use only once, around age 12, it was impossible to know how it changed over time, or to rule out other factors that might also affect brain development.
Without more information about other aspects of the students' lives, "it is challenging to discern how specific differences in brain development are to social media checking," said Adriana Galvan, a specialist in adolescent brain development at the University of California Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study.
Jennifer Pfeifer, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and co-director of the National Scientific Council on Adolescence, said, "All experience accumulates and is reflected in the brain."
"I think you want to put it into this context," she said. "So many other experiences that adolescents have will also be changing the brain. So we don't want to get into some kind of moral panic about the idea that social media is use is changing adolescents' brains."
Dr. Telzer, one of the study's authors, described the rising sensitivity to social feedback as "neither good nor bad."
"It's helping them connect to others and obtain rewards from the things that are common in their social world, which is engaging in social interactions online," she said.
"This is the new norm," she added. "Understanding how this new digital world is influencing teens is important. It may be associated with changes in the brain, but that may be for good or for bad. We don't necessarily know the long-term implications yet."

Fred White, 67, the Heart Of the Funk-Filled Beat In Earth, Wind & Fire: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He provided the beat on unforgettable hits like "September," "Let's Groove," "Shining Star" and "Boogie Wonderland."
Fred White, who as a drummer with Earth, Wind & Fire propelled some of the funkiest songs in pop history, helping to provide a soundtrack to the nation's weddings, bar mitzvahs, high school reunions and any other function at which people of all ages dance, died on Sunday. He was 67.
His death was announced on Instagram by his brother Verdine White, the band's bassist. The announcement did not say where he died or give the cause.
Fred White was a member of Earth, Wind & Fire during a pivotal period, from the mid-1970s to the early '80s, when the group made much of its most beloved music. He played on "Let's Groove," "Boogie Wonderland" and "Shining Star" and, most notably, on "September," which Spotify lists as having been played on its platform 1.18 billion times. The songs' first few bars alone have long been known to move people to the dance floor.
Earth, Wind & Fire was founded and led by Fred and Verdine's half brother, Maurice White. Though the band's music was recognizable for its joyous horn section and smooth vocals, Maurice, in his 2016 memoir, "My Life with Earth, Wind & Fire," described the group as "a band of drummers."
Maurice was himself an accomplished drummer (he was for a few years a member of the Ramsey Lewis Trio), and it was not out of character for four percussionists to play all at once during an Earth, Wind & Fire concert. For two years, Fred White and Ralph Johnson both performed onstage with full drum kits.
"Fred was the brick wall," Maurice White wrote in his memoir. "He provided a rock-solid tempo and a rock-solid feel, priceless qualities in a drummer. He was one of the best things going for us."
Frederick Eugene Adams was born on Jan. 13, 1955, in Chicago. He shared a mother with Maurice, Edna (Parker) White, a homemaker. His father, Verdine Sr., was a podiatrist.
Fred began playing the drums at 9. (Maurice called him a "child prodigy.") Fred, like Verdine Jr., changed his surname to White so that it would be clearer that he was related to Maurice.
Fred grew up "in the ghetto in Chicago," he told Modern Drummer magazine in 1982, and gained a sense of purpose from the drums. He began playing gigs when he was about 13. By 14, he was in a band that appeared in nightclubs. At 15, he was playing with the soul singer Donny Hathaway and making up excuses when he could not attend a session because of school.
After Fred toured with the rock band Little Feat, Maurice and Verdine decided that he had the chops to play with Earth, Wind & Fire. Fred was still a teenager.
In addition to Verdine, Mr. White's survivors include a sister, Geri. Maurice White died in 2016 at 74. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.
In his memoir, Maurice described Fred during his years with the band as a "daredevil spirit" who was "cocky, young and a bit arrogant" and created problems with his bandmates, stemming in particular from the unusual situation of having two drummers performing onstage at the same time.
Speaking to Modern Drummer, Fred White acknowledged that his early years sharing drumming duties with Mr. Johnson were a "battle," since he was "used to being the only drummer and used to carrying the band."
The group eventually dropped the dual drummer setup and shifted Mr. Johnson's responsibilities to vocals and other percussion instruments, including the congas.
"After we stopped doing it," Fred White told Modern Drummer, "I missed it."

Full text: The actor, known for his role as Hawkeye in Marvel's Avengers movies, had surgery, his representative said.
The actor Jeremy Renner was in critical but stable condition after being hospitalized with serious injuries from an accident while plowing snow in Nevada, his representative said in a statement.
Mr. Renner had surgery on Monday and had "suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries" from the accident, the representative, Samantha Mast, said in a statement, adding that Mr. Renner remained in the intensive care unit.
The sheriff's office in Washoe County, Nev., said Mr. Renner had suffered a "traumatic injury" in Reno on Sunday morning. He was the only person involved in the accident and was flown to a nearby hospital, the sheriff's office said. Mr. Renner has a house in the Mount Rose-Ski Tahoe area, according to The Reno-Gazette Journal.
Mr. Renner, 51, has played Hawkeye, a member of Marvel's Avengers superheroes team, in several movies and a television series. He has also twice been nominated for an Oscar, for his roles in "The Hurt Locker" (2008) and "The Town" (2010).
Ms. Mast said Mr. Renner and his family were "tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans."
Mr. Renner has shared several updates on social media this winter as the Reno area received large amounts of snow.
"Nearly done With sledding hill For the kids," said a caption on an Instagram video clip showing a snow plow last week.
"Lake Tahoe snowfall is no joke," he said last month in a tweet that showed a vehicle covered in snow.
Mr. Renner stars in "Mayor of Kingstown," a thriller whose second season is set to be released on the Paramount+ streaming service on Jan. 15. Another show, "Rennervations," which follows Mr. Renner as he helps communities to reimagine purpose-built vehicles, is scheduled to air on Disney+ early this year.
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning over the weekend for the areas around Reno, in addition to a warning that was in place for the Lake Tahoe Basin. On Saturday and Sunday, the Tahoe Basin at lake level received between 20 and 24 inches of snow, the Weather Service in Reno said.
The Weather Service on Sunday advised those with travel plans through the Sierra Nevada to prepare for winter weather driving conditions and warned of icy roads as additional storms arrive. About 22,000 customers in Nevada were without power early Monday after the storm, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.

Dubai Suspends Its Tax on Alcohol in a Bid to Fend Off Its Regional Tourism Rivals: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lower-cost liquor could help the emirate keep its edge over neighbors like Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the Middle East's hub for leisure and business.
Dubai started the new year by suspending its 30 percent tax on alcohol, a move that could help the Gulf emirate attract more tourists and businesses amid growing regional competition.
Dubai removed the tax on Sunday, along with the fee for a license that individuals need to buy alcohol, local beverage distributors said.
The emirate's government did not immediately confirm the policy changes, and the Dubai Media Office did not respond to a request for comment.
Offering significantly cheaper liquor is likely to bolster Dubai's position as the Middle East's center for tourism and business at a time when economists are warning of a global economic slowdown that could dent spending on travel and leisure.
More than 90 percent of Dubai's population are foreign residents, and alcohol has been widely available in the emirate for years, unlike nearby Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- where it remains banned -- and Qatar, where its purchase is more restricted. But the hefty municipality tax drove up alcohol prices in the city-state, where residents complain about the rising cost of living and tourism is often oriented toward luxury.
The changes are likely to give a boost to the local hospitality industry, Maritime and Mercantile International, one of the country's main distributors, said on LinkedIn on Monday.
"The prices are here to stay and are on a long-term trial," another liquor distributor, African + Eastern, said in a statement. The Financial Times reported that the tax suspension would last for a test period of one year, citing industry executives.
"Huge credit to Dubai Government for taking such a bold decision," Jason Dixon, chief executive of African + Eastern, said on Monday, adding that the company would pass on the full savings to consumers. "This announcement will be especially transformative for tourists and residents."
The decision was the latest in a series of measures that appear to be designed to cement Dubai's position as the dominant hub for tourism and investment in the Middle East.
While it is still the most popular regional destination for tourists and foreign workers, Dubai is facing increasing competition from Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been overhauling the kingdom's oil-dependent economy and rapidly loosening social restrictions in an effort to make Riyadh, the capital, a global destination.
The Saudi government has reined in the religious police, eased a conservative dress code, sponsored concerts and raves, and offered its first tourist visas in 2019. Officials have also been deploying a mixture of incentives and ultimatums to persuade multinational companies to locate their regional headquarters in Riyadh instead of Dubai.
Last year, Prince Mohammed said he wanted to eventually increase the proportion of foreign residents to 70 percent of the kingdom's population, from around one third now. That would require making Saudi Arabia a more appealing place for foreigners to live. While alcohol is still illegal, rumors have been spreading for years that the policy could change, perhaps in restricted zones or hotels -- as it once was in Dubai.
A semi-independent city-state in the Muslim-majority United Arab Emirates, Dubai has been loosening its alcohol regulations for years. Nominally, the government requires individuals who want to buy alcohol to obtain a license, which are only available for non-Muslims over the age of 21. But in practice, bars, clubs and restaurants almost never ask to see a permit.
Over the past few years, the United Arab Emirates has also eased immigration rules, decriminalized cohabitation for unmarried couples, and changed to a global business-oriented working week of Monday through Friday, diverging from its neighbors, which maintain a weekend of Friday and Saturday to accommodate Islam's communal Friday prayers.
Those policy changes were intended to make the country a more attractive place for foreigners to work and live. As in neighboring Qatar, the entire economy hinges on foreigners, from the low-wage workers who build skyscrapers and pump gasoline to highly-paid executives and Instagram influencers.
While some Emiratis are uncomfortable with the pace and direction of their country's transformation, vocal dissent has been largely repressed.
The availability of alcohol became a flash point in Qatar last year as the country hosted the men's soccer World Cup, reversing direction at the last minute to ban beer sales at the stadiums. Liquor is available in hotels and many restaurants in Qatar, but far less so than in Dubai.
It was not immediately clear how Dubai's removal of the alcohol tax would affect the government's finances. The emirate does not collect personal income tax, but unlike neighboring Abu Dhabi, has no significant oil resources, and relies on revenue from other taxes and fees, including the levy on alcohol. The United Arab Emirates plans to introduce a 9 percent corporate income tax later this year.

Five International Movies That Deliver a Jolt: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: From comedic secret agents to melodramatic comic book heroes, this month's action picks bend the genre.
'Hard Hit'
Stream it on Prime Video.
A remake of the Spanish director Dani de la Torre's "Retribution," the Korean director Kim Chang-ju's "Hard Hit" is a furious combination of "Speed" and "Phone Booth" that manages to swerve in unexpected ways. In it, Lee Sung-gyu (Jo Woo-jin), a successful bank manager and father, receives a mysterious phone call while driving his children to school. The voice on the line tells Lee that a bomb underneath his seat will explode if anyone leaves his car. The only way Lee or his children will live, the caller says, is if Lee deposits more than $ 4 million into the extortionist's account.
The tight streets of Busan serve as the claustrophobic canvas for big explosions and vast car chases as Lee speeds across the city to procure the ransom and avoid the cops who believe he is behind the resulting destruction. The fear on Jo's face grips you in the raucous set pieces. And a late appointment with a ghost from the past makes the chases worth every second.
'Head Rush'
Rent or buy on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Following a diagnosis of lung cancer, a young Vietnamese comic book artist named Tam (Curong Seven) is given two months to live. Rather than accepting a fate that will leave his wife widowed and his son fatherless, he turns to his Uncle Ma (Hoang Son), an experimental surgeon, to transplant his head onto the body of a dead gangster. The surgery magically imbues Tam with superhero strength like the characters in his graphic novels. His flights of courage such as saving a child from a burning building, however, soon bring attention from the gang who murdered the previous owner of his body.
"Head Rush," from the Vietnamese American director Victor Vu, is a melodramatic adrenaline hit that combines soap opera family dynamics -- as Tam's fame grows, his personal life crumbles -- with gravity-defying chase sequences atop roofs that lead to balletic fight scenes. Vu's awareness of how bodies can dynamically move within space is a key asset in this action-packed subversion of the superhero subgenre, giving "Head Rush" the kind of pulpy, B-movie fun missing from today's cinematic landscape.
'Hell Dogs'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Adapted from the manga of the same name by Fukamachi Akio, "Hell Dogs" combines neo-noir sensibilities with spaghetti western tropes for a suspenseful crime thriller filled with double-crosses and more undercover agents than you can count.
At the outset of the Japanese director Masato Harada's film, we see two gunmen infiltrate a supermarket, murdering three female workers in a black-and-white flashback. One of these employees is the crush of a local cop named Goro Idezutsi (Jun'ichi Okada). The death of his sweetheart sends Goro on a yearslong revenge binge that ultimately forces him to change his name to Kanetaka to infiltrate a Yakuza mob.
As is inevitable in a gangland drama, Goro soon loses his identity as he slides further toward the dark side of the law, becoming the trusted bodyguard of the Yakuza don Toake (Miyavi). With his unhinged partner, Murooka (Kentaro Sakaguchi), Goro carries out bloody hits and reprisals with the workmanlike precision of a man on a mission. Alliances are tested and revealed in a "Today I settled all family business" sequence filled with crazed shootouts and distressing assassinations of supposed friends.
'My Name Is Vendetta'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
While the Italian director Cosimo Gomez's "My Name Is Vendetta" follows in the footsteps of other "messed with the wrong man's family" films like "Commando" and "Taken," it discovers new terrain by focusing on not only Santo (Alessandro Gassmann), but also his daughter Sofia (Ginevra Francesconi).
Santo and Sofia are flung from their idyllic existence when she posts a picture of her father to Instagram. Facial recognition software locates Santo, causing a pair of murderous goons to kill Sofia's mother. Now Sofia and Santo venture toward Milan in search of the mafia boss (Remo Girone) who upended their lives.
Gomez puts action fans squarely in the carnage: There are close-ups of arms breaking, knives plunging into stomachs and blood dripping from victims' mouths. Between a tautly edited nighttime showdown in a rail yard and a cathartic final confrontation between Santo and the mafia boss, there's no shortage of high-octane brutality. And yet what makes "My Name Is Vendetta" indelible is the close family relationship that gives the bloody proceedings a tangible element of tenderness.
'Mission: Possible'
Stream it on Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A comedic spoof of the espionage subgenre akin to "Get Smart," "Mission: Possible," by the Korean writer and director Kim Hyeong-joo, entertains a hilarious premise: Yoo Da-hee (Lee Sun-bin), a secret agent on her first mission, teams with Woo Su-han (Kim Young-kwang), a man she thinks is a trained expert in subterfuge, to recover a shipment of stolen guns. There are two problems. Yoo doesn't know it, but her bosses consider her task a suicide mission. And Woo appears to be a bumbling idiot hoping to grift some cash.
In their investigation, the two meet a band of oddball characters, such as a flamboyant gay psychic and an older woman looking for her lost dog. Throughout, Kim masterfully breaks the farcical mood with lean gunplay captured by the cinematographer Nam Hyun-woo's kinetic use of shaky cam. The editor Heo Sun-mi further switches moods by either speeding up or reverting to slow motion. Magically, a satisfying twist turns the climax of "Mission: Possible" into an unforgettable, high-stakes game where love and war hang in the balance.
Photograph Above right, Kim Chang-ju's "Hard Hit" is a furious combination of "Speed" and "Phone Booth." Right, in "My Name Is Vendetta," Ginevra Francesconi plays a woman who goes on a mission with her father to find the Mafia boss who upended their lives.

For Starters, In Contention At Grammys: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The debut album of the New York Youth Symphony, featuring some players who were in middle school, is up against recordings by some of the world's top orchestras.
When the Grammy nominations for best orchestral performance were announced last month, several of the usual suspects made the cut. There was the august Berlin Philharmonic, for an album conducted by the composer John Williams, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the baton of its maestro, Gustavo Dudamel.
But a newcomer also got a nod: the debut album of the New York Youth Symphony, a prestigious musical program for musicians between the ages of 12 and 22.
The news that the ensemble's album had earned a Grammy nomination astonished some of its young players.
"I jumped in the air and I screamed, like I have never screamed before," said Isabella Marquez, 18, who played violin on the album and watched a livestream of the Grammy nominations announcement in the kitchen of her Manhattan apartment with her mother and grandmother.
"I never thought that I would be on an album, much less a Grammy-nominated album," said Marquez.
The recording might never have happened had it not been for the pandemic. When live performance was halted in 2020, and a Carnegie Hall concert was canceled, the ensemble decided to try to make an album instead.
After the police murder of George Floyd and the social justice protests that spread throughout the nation that summer, the orchestra decided to rehearse and record works by Black composers, and selected pieces by Florence Price, Jessie Montgomery and Valerie Coleman. "We need to promote music that deals with these issues," the orchestra's music director, Michael Repper, said in an interview.
The album, which is untitled, came together after six weeks of remote instruction followed by in person socially distant rehearsals and four days of recording sessions in which the musicians recorded the sections of the orchestra separately -- all without a single Covid-19 infection, Repper noted. It was produced by Judith Sherman, a 13-time Grammy winner, who is nominated as classical producer of the year.
Many of the young players were proud to have simply recorded an album during the pandemic. They were stunned when it was recognized by the Grammys, amid such illustrious competition -- orchestras many of them have long revered.
Joshua Choi, an 18-year-old principal clarinetist in the youth program, said he listened to the Berlin Philharmonic's principal clarinetist, Andreas Ottensamer, whenever he needed motivation.
After learning of the Grammy nomination, he couldn't find the words to tell his parents, and stared in shock at his roommate, who plays oboe in the youth symphony, Choi said.
"That's pretty mind blowing," Choi said. "I still can't process that."
Iris Sung, the orchestra's 17-year-old concertmaster, said she was in class at Tenafly High School in New Jersey when the nomination was announced. After her mother broke the news on her way home from school, she shared the nomination on Instagram, and as her phone flooded with congratulatory messages she thought back to recording it "in such a strange time."
"Just knowing that all that had paid off, I think was just something so special to me," Sung said.
The album features music by Price, including "Ethiopia's Shadow in America" and her Piano Concerto in One Movement, featuring the pianist Michelle Cann; "Umoja: Anthem of Unity" by Coleman; and "Soul Force," by Montgomery.
Montgomery, 40, a composer whose works have been performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and the Minnesota Orchestra, and who is now the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's composer in residence, played violin with the New York Youth Symphony as a teenager.
"It was the first time I had ever played youth symphonies, really, and it was a really important moment in my education," Montgomery said. "That was my gateway into orchestral music."
For this recording, she held a video call with the young players, where she answered their questions on articulation and dynamics.
When she was young, Montgomery said, orchestras rarely played music by Black composers. She said it was comforting to see that change.
"Young people in the world right now are coming up in music at a time where Black art is centralized, and I think that is a very positive thing from the perspective of a young person," Montgomery said.
Kennedy Plains, a 22-year-old bassoonist and former member of the Youth Symphony, said that she was glad that ensembles were playing music by a more diverse roster of composers, and that she had appreciated the chance to work with Montgomery on a video call.
"I hadn't really got to play works by a lot of composers of color before," Plains said, who learned to play the bassoon in middle school.
Jessica Jeon, 14, a violinist, said that after learning of Price through the youth program, she gave a presentation about her to her seventh grade civil and human rights class.
Price, who became the first Black woman to have her music played by a major American orchestra in 1933 when the Chicago Symphony performed her Symphony in E Minor, has been enjoying a renaissance in recent years, along with other composers of color.
"They didn't have the chance to become super well known such as Mozart or Beethoven because of their race or their gender or their sexuality," said Jeon, who was 12 when the album was recorded. "Because of that, I felt inspired to try to introduce more people to them."
When the youth symphony returned to Carnegie Hall last month, it played with Dmytro Tishyn, a 16-year-old bassoonist from Ukraine who had fled after the Russian invasion.
Repper, who will pass his music director role to Andrew Jinhong Kim in the 2023-2024 season, said that he hopes the album inspires more orchestras to play and record music by Black composers.
"Orchestras don't deserve any extra credit at this point for performing works by Black composers," he said. "They don't deserve any extra credit for performing works by women. It's something that should have been done for decades."
The Grammy Awards will be presented on Feb. 5 in Los Angeles.

Jailed Putin Critics Offer New Year Messages: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Seasonal greetings from imprisoned opponents offered counterprogramming of a sort to the traditional end-of-year speech from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
There are now so many jailed opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin and his full-scale invasion of Ukraine that a new tradition has emerged in Russia: New Year's greetings from political prisoners.
Aleksei A. Navalny, the prominent opposition leader who has been behind bars since early 2021, said that he had received so many seasonal decorations in letters from supporters that he hung them up in his cell at his prison outside Moscow. An hour later, the warden took them down, "but the feeling remained," he said.
Mr. Navalny's treatment in prison has worsened, including repeated stints in solitary confinement, but he still receives visits from lawyers and is able to get messages out to his supporters.
"The calamity that has befallen our country has brought all normal, honest people closer together, and it's not surprising that a connection appears between them," Mr. Navalny wrote in a post on Instagram on Saturday, thanking his supporters. "I can feel it."
The Putin critics' New Year's messages are a counterprogramming of sorts to the traditional year-end speech from the president, who delivered his address on New Year's Eve surrounded by men and women in uniform. Mr. Putin vowed to continue his onslaught against Ukraine, asserting that "moral and historical righteousness is on our side."
Ilya Yashin, an anti-Kremlin activist and politician who was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in December for "spreading false information" about atrocities committed in the Ukrainian city of Bucha by Russian troops, wrote on Friday that he had been transferred to a jail in Izhevsk, a city 600 miles east of Moscow.
"I'm OK, friends," Mr. Yashin wrote. "I want to remind you that the criminal war against Ukraine must be stopped, that Putin must go, and that Russia must be free and happy." He added his address in jail to the message, reminding his supporters that they could write to him through the Russian penitentiary system's online service.
Mediazona, an independent Russian news outlet, published an article on Saturday collecting New Year's greetings from political prisoners. Aleksei Gorinov, a Moscow lawmaker sentenced in July to seven years in prison for denouncing the war, wrote that he remained "an optimist who believes in man" because "in Russia there is no other way to live," and wished for an end "to this useless, crazy war."
Vladimir Kara-Murza, an activist and journalist under investigation for treason, also struck an optimistic note, though he faces as long as 20 years in prison. "The past year became one of the darkest in the memory of living generations," Mr. Kara-Murza wrote. "But the dawn comes after even the darkest night -- and it will definitely come."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant has so far taken steps to streamline without mass layoffs, but employees are girding for deeper cuts.
Google workers in Switzerland sent a letter this month to the company's vice president of human resources, outlining their worries that a new employee evaluation system could be used to cull the work force.
"The number and spread of reports that reached us indicates that at least some managers were aggressively pressured to apply a quota" on a process that could lead to employees getting negative ratings and potentially losing their jobs, five workers and employee representatives wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The letter signaled how some Google employees are increasingly interpreting recent management decisions as warnings that the company may be angling to conduct broader layoffs. From the impending closure of a small office and the cancellation of a content-moderation project to various efforts to ease budgets during 2023 planning meetings, the Silicon Valley behemoth has become a tinderbox of anxiety, according to interviews with 14 current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
In some cases, Google employees have reacted to a program that the company began in July to simplify operations, cut red tape and make itself more productive. In other instances, they have had budget conversations, with some teams unable to hire more next year, the people said. And workers have also fretted over decisions made months ago that, to some, have taken on new meaning, they said.
The worries have grown as Google's tech industry peers have handed out pink slips amid a souring global economy. Last month, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, purged its ranks by 11,000, or about 13 percent of its work force. Amazon also began laying off about 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs, or about 3 percent of its corporate employees.
Even Google, which is on track to make tens of billions of dollars in profits this year, has had to come to terms with a slowdown. In October, as the digital advertising market slumped, Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported that profit dropped 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $ 13.9 billion.
Google did not comment on employee anxiety in a response to a request from The Times. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said in October that the company would "focus on a clear set of product and business priorities." He also said it would slow hiring and "moderate" the growth of its expenses.
Unlike other big tech companies, Google has so far avoided large-scale job cuts. Still, investors have pushed the company to become more aggressive about "defending" its huge profits, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI.
"One of the most obvious ways to do that is to cut costs and reduce your employee head count," he said. He added that it was "kind of odd" that Google's parent had hired 30,000 employees in the last three quarters, given the economic trends. At the end of September, Alphabet had 186,779 workers.
In recent months, Google has appeared to pay more attention to costs. In July, it started the program to streamline operations. Soon after, it canceled some projects, including the Pixelbook laptop and Stadia, its streaming platform for video games. It has also reduced funding for Area 120, an in-house product incubator.
At one recent meeting, a Google human resources representative told a worker that the company would revisit the possibility of broader layoffs in the new year, and that it was a decision for Mr. Pichai, according to an audio recording obtained by The Times.
Google has told other employees that it would put a priority on trimming real estate expenditures, travel costs and perks before it pursued layoffs, said a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The company plans to close a small office in Farmington Hills, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, next month.
Project cancellations and reorganizations have stoked nervousness. In September, Google's YouTube shut down a project based in the Farmington Hills office with nearly 80 workers, laying off some staff members who did not find new roles at the company, four people familiar with the decision said. YouTube had hired them as contract workers to moderate content on the video platform. Google said 14 workers had lost their jobs.
Google said that through these types of reorganizations, it was not looking to reduce the size of its overall work force, but that some teams might eliminate roles as the company reassessed its priorities.
Some teams that consistently grew in the past will be unable to hire more people next year, four people familiar with the situation said. There are also higher demands for 2023 planning, such as a manager's being asked to draft plans on how to handle 10 different budget scenarios instead of three or four, one person said. In planning discussions, leaders have pressed managers to justify their expenses, asking if there are workarounds or team reorganizations that could save money, two people said.
One of the biggest concerns for some employees has been whether Google could use its new performance-evaluation system to accelerate job cuts. In May, the company installed the new system, called Googler Reviews and Development.
Under the system, managers expect the bottom 2 percent of employees to be categorized as having "not enough impact," according to two people familiar with the matter. Another 4 percent should be judged as providing "moderate impact."
Concerns have intensified that the bottom 6 percent, or roughly 11,000 people, could be targeted for dismissal, according to four people, and as earlier reported by the tech news site The Information.
The GRAD system means Google now has two categories for employees who are considered low performing, compared with one under the old program, potentially leading to a bigger pool of workers at the bottom. The system has also had a bumpy rollout, with managers and employees confused about how it should work, according to the letter and four employees.
Google said it expected workers would become more comfortable with the system over time. It added that it had a no-surprises policy, meaning employees would know well in advance if their performance was falling short.
Before handing out the two lowest ratings, managers are also supposed to notify employees in "support check-in" meetings. Google said not every such meeting would lead to a lower rating, with support check-ins also held for those who need extra help to meet their obligations.
Employees would also have indications if their manager wanted to put them on a "performance improvement" plan, the company said, a process that compels workers to improve their work within 60 days to keep their jobs. Google has given workers the choice of staying on a performance-improvement plan or resigning with a buyout package.
Google said that it had not made changes to increase the number of performance plans, and that it had offered these types of severance options for years.
This month's letter from some of Google's workers in Switzerland to Fiona Cicconi, the vice president of human resources, was led by members of a 15-person employee representation committee, ER-CH.
One of their primary concerns was that contrary to what some Google executives have said, the company may have a quota for the number of employees who were supposed to have support check-ins, and whose jobs might therefore be vulnerable.
Google said it had not imposed a quota on support check-ins. But when almost no one used these meetings after the GRAD system was put in place, it said, it asked leaders to convey the importance of the meetings to managers.
The memo signatories in Switzerland also said there was confusion, among managers and workers alike, about who qualified for a support check-in. They urged Ms. Cicconi to put guardrails in place so that the system did not lead to mass firings.
"It's normal that new processes don't run smoothly in the beginning, but this should not happen at the expense of Googlers' well-being, careers and compensation," they wrote.

Her Google Account Was Wiped Over a Child's Video. An Appeals Path Has Changed.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: People who upload images of children that Google flags as potentially illegal will be able to provide more context to appeal bans.
When Google informed a mother in Colorado that her account had been disabled, it felt as if her house had burned down, she said. In an instant, she lost access to her wedding photos, videos of her son growing up, her emails going back a decade, her tax documents and everything else she had kept in what she thought would be the safest place. She had no idea why.
Google refused to reconsider the decision in August, saying her YouTube account contained harmful content that might be illegal. It took her weeks to discover what had happened: Her 9-year-old eventually confessed that he had used an old smartphone of hers to upload a YouTube Short of himself dancing around naked.
Google has an elaborate system, involving algorithmic monitoring and human review, to prevent the sharing and storing of exploitative images of children on its platforms. If a photo or video uploaded to the company's servers is deemed to be sexually explicit content featuring a minor, Google disables the user's account, across all of Google's services, and reports the content to a nonprofit that works with law enforcement. Users have an opportunity to challenge Google's action, but in the past they had no real opportunity to provide context for a nude photo or video of a child.
Now, after reporting by The New York Times, Google has changed its appeals process, giving users accused of the heinous crime of child sexual exploitation the ability to prove their innocence. The content deemed exploitative will still be removed from Google and reported, but the users will be able to explain why it was in their account -- clarifying, for example, that it was a child's ill-thought-out prank.
Susan Jasper, Google's head of trust and safety operations, said in a blog post that the company would "provide more detailed reasons for account suspensions." She added, "And we will also update our appeals process to allow users to submit even more context about their account, including to share more information and documentation from relevant independent professionals or law enforcement agencies to aid our understanding of the content detected in the account."
In recent months The Times, reporting on the power that technology companies wield over the most intimate parts of their users' lives, brought to Google's attention several instances when its previous review process appeared to have gone awry.
In two separate cases, fathers took photos of their naked toddlers to facilitate medical treatment. An algorithm automatically flagged the images, and then human moderators deemed them in violation of Google's rules. The police determined that the fathers had committed no crime, but the company still deleted their accounts.
The fathers, one in California and the other in Texas, found themselves stymied by Google's previous appeals process: At no point were they able to provide medical records, communications with their doctors or police documents absolving them of wrongdoing. The father in San Francisco eventually got six months of his Google data back, but on a thumb drive from the Police Department, which had gotten it from the company with a warrant.
"When we find child sexual abuse material on our platforms, we remove it and suspend the related account," a Google spokesman, Matt Bryant, said in a statement. "We take the implications of suspending an account seriously, and our teams work constantly to minimize the risk of an incorrect suspension."
Technology companies that offer free services to consumers are notoriously bad at customer support. Google has billions of users. Last year, it disabled more than 270,000 accounts for violating its rules against child sexual abuse material. In the first half of this year, it disabled more than it did in all of 2021.
"We don't know what percentage of those are false positives," said Kate Klonick, an associate professor at St. John's University School of Law who studies internet governance issues. Even just 1 percent would result in hundreds of appeals per month, she said. She predicted that Google would need to expand its trust and safety team to handle the disputes.
"It seems like Google is making the right move," Ms. Klonick said, "to adjudicate and solve for false positives. But it's an expensive proposition."
Evelyn Douek, an assistant professor at Stanford Law School, said she would like Google to provide more details about how the new appeals process would work.
"Just the establishment of a process doesn't solve everything. The devil is in the details," she said. "Is the new review meaningful? What is the timeline?"
It took four months for the mother in Colorado, who asked that her name not be used to protect her son's privacy, to get her account back. Google reinstated it after The Times brought the case to the company's attention.
"We understand how upsetting it would be to lose access to your Google account, and the data stored in it, due to a mistaken circumstance," Mr. Bryant said in a statement. "These cases are extraordinarily rare, but we are working on ways to improve the appeals process when people come to us with questions about their account or believe we made the wrong decision."
Google did not tell the woman that the account was active again. Ten days after her account had been reinstated, she learned of the decision from a Times reporter.
When she logged in, she found that everything had been restored beyond the video her son had made. A message popped up on YouTube, featuring an illustration of a referee blowing a whistle and saying her content had violated community guidelines. "Because it's the first time, this is just a warning," the message said.
"I wish they had just started here in the first place," she said. "It would have saved me months of tears."
Jason Scott, a digital archivist who wrote a memorably profane blog post in 2009 warning people not to trust the cloud, said companies should be legally obligated to give users their data, even when an account was closed for rule violations.
"Data storage should be like tenant law," Mr. Scott said. "You shouldn't be able to hold someone's data and not give it back."
The mother also received an email from "The Google Team," sent on Dec. 9.
"We understand that you attempted to appeal this several times, and apologize for the inconvenience this caused," it said. "We hope you can understand we have strict policies to prevent our services from being used to share harmful or illegal content, especially egregious content like child sexual abuse material."
Many companies besides Google monitor their platforms to try to prevent the rampant sharing of child sexual abuse images. Last year, more than 100 companies sent 29 million reports of suspected child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the nonprofit that acts as the clearinghouse for such material and passes reports on to law enforcement for investigation. The nonprofit does not track how many of those reports represent true abuse.
Meta sends the highest volume of reports to the national center -- more than 25 million in 2021 from Facebook and Instagram. Last year, data scientists at the company analyzed some of the flagged material and found examples that qualified as illegal under federal law but were "non-malicious." In a sample of 150 flagged accounts, more than 75 percent "did not exhibit malicious intent," said the researchers, giving examples that included a "meme of a child's genitals being bitten by an animal" that was shared humorously and teenagers sexting each other.

Realistic Expectations for the Year Ahead: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some people are giving themselves permission to replace grand ambitions with more realistic expectations for 2023.
Erin Monroe, who lives in upstate New York and works in human services, knows that 2022 -- our supposed post-pandemic, Roaring Twenties, carefree year -- wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
"I just feel like when I'm connecting with people, everybody has something happening right now that is hard," she said. Her children, ages 9, 7 and 4, have been bringing home one virus after another from school. Her friends are worried about their personal finances and scared that the country is hurtling into an economic crisis.
"Then there are the bad things happening in other parts of the world," she said. "It kind of feels like we are running against the wind with cement shoes on."
Just before Christmas she started seeing the usual, predictable New Year's content pop up on her social media feeds. "It was the 'new year, new you' or 'let's make it the best year ever' type of stuff," she said. People were making resolutions to achieve challenging goals, whether it was to pay off student debt or lose 30 pounds.
She thought it struck the wrong tone.
So, in her fluffy pink robe and glasses, she posted a video on TikTok suggesting a different approach to the new year. "I think we need to set some expectations," she announced with fervor. "I don't need 2023 to be my year; I need it to not be a soul-sucking drag through earthly purgatory."
"I need 2023 to come in, sit down, shut up and don't touch anything," she added. "I need a palate cleanser year."
The message struck a chord. Within two days, the video had 1.8 million views and thousands of comments. "I feel this in my soul," responded one user. "I just need 2023 to simply 'be,"' wrote another. Some people shared the trauma they've experienced this year, whether they lost a loved one or couldn't pay their bills. The video now has more than 2.4 million views in less than a week.
Ms. Monroe, 36, wasn't surprised. "I think people just want some relief, that they feel like they can take a deep breath," she said. "People are saying I need a year where I can just get myself in order."
Optimistically she added, "Maybe 2023 will be a primer for the best year ever."
Sure, many people are still going into the new year with great excitement. The ball will drop in Times Square, fireworks will go off around the world and many will make personal resolutions to start off on the right foot. TikTok and Instagram are full of predictable content hyping up the new year. Another TikTok creator, Zack Kravits, garnered more than 300,000 views with his video demonstrating all the ways you can "rebrand yourself" in 2023. (No. 12: "Do the thing that scares you.")
But after yet another tumultuous year -- more Covid uncertainty, midterm elections, rising gas and grocery prices, gun violence, extreme heat waves in the summer and frigid temperatures in the winter -- some Americans are opting to keep their expectations in check for 2023.
The American Psychiatric Association found that 26 percent of American adults expect to experience more stress at the start of the new year, up from 20 percent who said the same thing last December. Notably, 55 percent said that one of their greatest sources of stress was the uncertainty of 2023.
A recent survey conducted by Ipsos, a global market research company, found that only 65 percent of respondents reported feeling optimistic that 2023 would be better than 2022, compared with 77 percent a year earlier.
So rather than starting the fresh year with high hopes or great anticipation, many people are crossing their fingers for a year that simply isn't terrible. It's telling that Ms. Monroe's viral TikTok made its rounds on the internet with the accompanying hashtag #Don'tSuck2023.
Nina Robinson, 39, a stay-at-home mother in Sacramento, used to love the start of a new year. "I love to make a list. I love to set up goals and have a plan to go after them," she said. "I do often feel that energy in January."
But this year she said she doesn't have the bandwidth even to think about her goals, let alone achieve them. "This January I just want calm, and I want things to be as simple as possible," she said.
Ms. Robinson feels worn-down by the past three years. "Covid is still here, and now there is R.S.V. and, by the way, the flu is the worst we've seen in our entire lives," she said. In 2022, her youngest child attended in-person school for the first time at the age of 7, which she said was a stressful transition. She also became a first-time homeowner, though she soon ran into a serious plumbing issue. "Buying a house was a goal we had for this year, and we accomplished that, but it came with its own can of worms," she said.
"What we really need is a chance to pause and process and release the last three years, but we haven't been given that opportunity because things are coming at us so quickly," she continued. "Maybe this year we will finally get that, and then we can have a clear slate to move forward."
Having low expectations, while perhaps sad, can also feel surprisingly refreshing. "There is all this pressure to achieve big things, but maybe it's better to not eliminate everything you do in your current life and replace it with new habits," Ms. Robinson said.
Jacob McCleery, who works for a tire retailer in South Bend, Ind., is more worried about a friend who is very enthusiastic about the arrival of the new year. "One of my really dear friends has had a truly awful year, and I know he's viewing it as, 'Let's start over, let's make a fresh start, let's make it the best year ever,"' Mr. McCleery, 28, said. "But just because it's a new year doesn't mean any emotions you are dealing with, any problems you have aren't going to carry over."
"It's a good mind-set to have, but it's also a little bit dangerous," he added.
Mr. McCleery said if the past few years had taught him anything, it was that we have no idea what is on the horizon. "For 2022, everyone had this idea of, 'We're in our post-pandemic life now, and this is going to be the year when we would start feeling normal,"' he said. "That's not what happened at all."
"It was a very average year for me personally," he said. "I didn't have any major heartbreak or disappointment, but I also didn't have anything really exciting or wonderful."
He said he was somewhat worried that not making ambitious resolutions might mean he was not pushing himself to grow as a person, but he had decided to go into 2023 without preconceived notions. "It's a little pessimistic, but let's let this year be what it is and be OK with the results," he said.
At least for now, lowering the bar feels necessary. As he put it, "We need to protect ourselves a little bit so we don't get disappointed."
Ms. Monroe said she would at least start 2023 with something that made her feel good: connecting with other people who were thinking the same things she was. "That's why I put my thoughts out there in my video," she said. "It's just funny that I was in my robe. It's always the ones where I am in my robe that go viral."
