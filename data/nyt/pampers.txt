Abstract: None available.

Full text: I wrote a column recently lamenting the decline in marriage rates, noting that a record half of American adults are now unmarried. As a long-married romantic myself, steeped in statistics suggesting that marriage correlates with happiness, I found that sad.
My readers, not so much.
Many women readers in particular dismissed heterosexual marriage as an outdated institution that pampers men while turning women into unpaid servants.
"Marriage is generally GREAT for men," declared a woman reader from North Carolina whose comment on the column was the single most liked, with more than 2,000 people recommending it. Wives get stuck with the caregiving, she added, and "the sex that receives the care is gonna be happier than the sex that doesn't receive the care."
The second most recommended reader comment came from a woman who said that when she and her women friends get together, "We all say, 'Never again.' Men require a lot of care. They can be such babies."
I think these skeptics make some valid points -- we men do need to up our game! -- even as I remain a staunch believer in marriage for both straight and gay couples. But put aside for a moment questions about marriage. The deluge of annoyance among some women readers intrigued me because while it's anecdotal, it aligns with considerable survey evidence of a growing political, cultural and social divide between men and women throughout the industrialized world.
A poll across 20 countries by the Glocalities research group found "a growing divide between young men and young women" in political and social outlook, while The Economist examined polling across rich countries and likewise found that young women are becoming significantly more liberal as young men are becoming somewhat more conservative.
A study by Pew found that compared with never-married women, never-married men in the United States are 50 percent more likely to align with Republicans.
One gauge of the rightward drift of young men: In 2014 men ages 55 to 65 were the most conservative group, according to the Glocalities data, while now young men are more conservative than older ones.
The backdrop is that boys and men are lagging in education and much less likely than women to get college degrees. Many of these less educated men struggle in the job market, and increasingly some of them seem to blame their problems on feminism. Young men are more likely than older men to tell pollsters that "advancing women's and girls' rights has gone too far"; women of all ages disagree.
A remarkable 45 percent of young men ages 18 to 29 say that in America today, men face discrimination. Older men are less likely to feel that way.
The upshot, polling suggests, is that men are becoming grumpier and more resentful of women's success, and more drawn to conservative authoritarian populists, from Donald Trump to misogynist internet personalities like Andrew Tate.
The Glocalities survey concluded that around the world the "radical right increasingly finds fertile ground among young men, which is already impacting elections." Representative Matt Gaetz suggested that it doesn't matter if Republicans antagonize female voters because they can be replaced by male voters.
The gender gap is easiest to measure in politics, but the Brookings Institution warned last week that it "also appears in measures other than politics and points to some deeper and potentially even more concerning issues among young people."
"The social bonds of previous generations appear to be eroding among young people, and this has serious consequences for coupling, future birthrates and social cohesion," Brookings said.
One of the most discussed chasms between the sexes is in South Korea, where nearly 80 percent of young men say that men are discriminated against, and where (male) President Yoon Suk Yeol was elected in 2022 in part on an antifeminist platform. Women have their own complaints, including how unhelpful their husbands are in the house. Some Korean feminists have created the 4B movement, which promotes no marriage, no babies, no dating and no sex. South Korea's total fertility rate has plummeted to one of the lowest in the world, with the average woman now having just 0.7 children.
Brad Wilcox, a sociologist at the University of Virginia, suggests in a recent book on marriage that the gender divide in South Korea and other Asian countries may offer a glimpse of what is coming to the United States. He estimates that perhaps one-third of today's young Americans will never marry, with couples living together not replacing marriages. More people, he says, are simply detached and on their own.
Some women in America have publicly proclaimed that they are distancing themselves from men, abstaining from sex or going "boy sober." Nearly 70 percent of breakups of heterosexual marriages in the United States are initiated by the wife.
One window into gender tensions is a viral meme on TikTok in which women discuss whether they would rather encounter a bear in the woods or a man. Many go with the bear.
Young people are not only marrying less and partnering less; they're also having less sex. Traditionally, older folks worried that young people were too promiscuous; now perhaps we geezers should fret about youthful celibacy.
Perhaps this gender divide will reverse and fix itself. Or perhaps, as some of those women commenters suggested, it's not a problem, or else it's a problem for men alone. But polling finds that both young men and young women across the Western world are deeply unhappy at a time when they seem to be drifting apart and increasingly report that they are "unpartnered." I've written enough about the epidemic of loneliness to be troubled by these divides; social isolation is estimated to be as lethal as smoking.
To me, the fundamental problem is the struggle of men to adapt to a world in which brawn matters less than brains, education and emotional intelligence. That's an important topic that we haven't addressed enough, despite alarm bells like Richard Reeves's 2022 book, "Of Boys and Men."
Reeves and others have proposed many ideas, including recruiting more male teachers, adding more recess and holding boys back so they start school later than girls. Vocational training programs like career academies and Per Scholas help, too.
I worry that gender frictions may grow and add tension to modern life, leaving more people facing the world alone with no one to snuggle up to and provide long-term comfort. I fear that I'm a romantic in a world that is becoming less romantic.

Oh, the Money They Make: [SpecialSections]

Full text: People from all types of backgrounds have become stars -- and it's a trend that's expected to get even bigger and make them even richer in years to come.
This article is part of our special section on the DealBook Summit that included business and policy leaders from around the world.
Barney Banks shot a cute video of himself changing his son's diaper. His mother-in-law suggested he post it to TikTok. His partner agreed. So he did.
"In 24 hours, we had 100,000 followers from changing that one diaper and five million-plus views," said Mr. Banks, a former professional dancer who is now an e-sports host. "Why? It seems like certain areas of content creation explode on the scene at different times. I hit the parenting and content creator spike."
Today, a little more than a year and a half after that post, Mr. Banks has 1.7 million followers under the TikTok handle @iammrbanks and has amassed 48.6 million likes on his posts. He now has sponsorship deals with Pampers, baby food companies and clothing brands as well as an agent to negotiate all of it for him.
This is the randomness and power of the creator economy, a loosely defined amalgam of people who post content, amass followers and likes, and get paid for their reach. What's not random is the size of the creator economy. It is projected to be valued around $ 480 billion by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs Research.
"A lot of people think the creator economy is people on Instagram posting about beauty products and making money from it," said Derek Goode, senior vice president of creator marketing at 160over90, a brand agency owned by the entertainment company Endeavor. "That's a sliver of it."
"The creator economy is anyone making content and making money off of it," Mr. Goode said. "It could be someone at home doing Spanish lessons on a subscription platform. It could be doctors selling advice. You see a ton of this in the fitness space. It's much larger than influencers on Instagram."
Mr. Banks said in October 2022, six months after that post, that he had 1.2 million followers and received a message from an agent asking to represent him. "When the agency asked me who I wanted to work with, I said, realistically, who would want to work with me and who would be a long-term relationship?"
That process of brands and creators linking up is not loose and free. "We've just gotten so smart about how we vet creators," said Myisha Moore, vice president of influencer marketing at Edelman, a public relations and marketing firm. "We make sure the person and the brand align."
Want to target people who like beer and wellness in New Orleans? Big agencies can scrape data and find that person for you.
But sometimes niches are what a brand wants more than a massive number of followers. "What we tend to see is the bigger the following the less the connection they have with their followers," Mr. Goode said. "When you have a smaller following, you're building it yourself. It's manageable. Micro creators with 25,000 to 125,000 followers are more impactful to some companies."
Hailey Hunter, a rink-side broadcaster for the N.H.L.'s Pittsburgh Penguins with 66,000 followers on Instagram, fits into this category. She was a golfer at Ohio University who hoped to play professionally. But then she went into sports broadcasting.
She has a deal with PGA Tour Superstores to curate her own line of clothing -- meaning it is a mix of different brands that she promotes, as opposed to clothing she creates on her own.
"I'll be sharing all of my looks on my Instagram page, talking to the camera and explaining why they can be worn to work as well as to the course," Ms. Hunter said. "My followers know I'm very authentic in myself and they trust me and what the PGA Tour Superstore stands for."
On its end, the golf retailing chain is looking to reach people who like golf but aren't watching the network broadcasts to get their information about the sport.
"There are so many fans of golf who are not the traditional audience," said Jill Thomas, chief marketing officer at PGA Tour Superstores. "You have to reach emerging golfers or nontraditional golfers in a different way."
But that's not to say influencers can post whatever they want when they want The contracts for content have provisions and requirements in them like any other sponsorship deal.
"There isn't anything we've posted on our social channels that didn't hit the mark we wanted," Ms. Thomas said. "There's lots of stuff on the cutting room floor."
In most cases, these campaigns are planned months in advance, which provides time to pivot if the creator does something that doesn't align with the brand.
"We're working with humans," Ms. Moore said. "I've had to pull someone from a campaign because they got caught in something criminal. We always make sure our brands are covered."
The vetting process is the core of what every agency does. And given the digital footprint of almost all creators it should be easy to dive deep into people's online past. The exception is a new area within college sports where student-athletes are paid for the use of their name, image and likeness, or N.I.L.
Such deals aren't just going to the best football or basketball players. One of the top N.I.L. earners is Olivia Dunne, a gymnast at Louisiana State University whose annual deals are valued at around $ 3.5 million. "When we tell a company to work with a college athlete, their eyes bug out," Ms. Moore said. "The vetting is very heavy."
Lingering around all of this is how the Federal Trade Commission regulates the alliance between brands and influencers, namely what influencers can say and how they can say it in service of brands. Pretending something isn't a paid post is legally dicey.
"For me, the most important thing is that 'ad' is the first word in the caption," Mr. Banks said. "You don't want to make a piece of content look like an ad. I want it to look like an organic video, but I need to tell people it's an advertisement. That's why the nappy [diaper] videos were such a good fit, and then I drop in that this is a great product as I'm doing it."
Influencer marketing in the future is likely to look highly professionalized, with a distinct bifurcation between influencers who are brands onto themselves and leading the conversations, and creators who are more mom-and-pop in their feel.
"It's going to start to split off," said Ms. Moore. "The creators who really want to stay in the game are going to learn how to work with A.I. They're going to amplify their creativity to a new level. They're going to come back with insights into the audience and say, 'I'm going to set you apart.' The ones who are having fun, making a little passive income -- they're going to find it harder to create."
It's also going to be something seen as a profession like any other. "It's moving from an alternative pathway to a primary career to the new generation," said Mark Zablow, chief executive of Cogent World, an influencer marketing firm. "It's built on key pillars -- community, authenticity and digital artisanship, which is the ability to create digitally."
Yet none of this works if the audience doesn't believe that the creators -- who formed a bond with their followers before there were advertising dollars behind them -- are authentic in what they are saying.
"The limitations really only come when you don't find the authentic relationship between the brand and the creator," Mr. Goode said. "If the beauty creator is trying to sell beer to their audience and they've never done it before, then it won't work."

'Dadfluencers,' or Fathers With Followings: [Style Desk]

Full text: Fueled by the pandemic and TikTok, a market for content made by fathers has staying power. Meet the "Dadfluencers."
Like many parents in the early months of the pandemic, Dave Ogleton was struggling. His business selling nutrition products was at a standstill. He and his wife, Jackie Megraw, were stuck at home in Devon, Pa., with their five (soon to be six) children, several of whom were languishing in Zoom classes.
To blow off steam, he started recording funny videos and memes about his family life and posting them on social media under the account @fitdadceo. People seemed to like them, so he posted more, with a recurring theme of "dad jokes." ("I said to my son, 'What do you call a group of crows that stick together?' He said, 'A flock.' I said, 'No, dummy. Vel-Crow."')
"Not taking myself seriously, especially in such a serious time, was freeing," Mr. Ogleton said. His audience began growing, so he posted every day. "It was very off the cuff, but I think other dads saw it and were like, 'Oh, yeah, we're doing that stuff too.' "
Today, Mr. Ogleton, who wears fitted T-shirts and a backward baseball cap in most of his videos, has 1.1 million followers on TikTok, along with partnership deals with Disney+, Netflix, Pampers and Procter & Gamble. He also sells merchandise printed with dad-joke phrases, like "It's not a dad bod. It's a father figure" and "I used to be cool."
"I'm a full-time content creator now, and it allows me to spend a lot more time with my kids," he said. "Just being around them gives me ideas. It's a double bonus."
Turning the camera on his family life also pushed Mr. Ogleton to pitch in more around the house (which, based on his videos, looks like a very normal suburban home cluttered with kids' stuff). He hadn't realized how much work needed to be done.
"Now I understand why my wife gets frustrated and run down sometimes," he said. "As dads, many of us have a lot to learn and do at home, but I think there's been a shift."
Mr. Ogleton is part of a growing number of dad influencers -- or "dadfluencers" -- who have amassed sizable followings in the past couple of years. "Fathers have been gradually playing a bigger role in the domestic lives of their families for a while, but I think the pandemic really supercharged it," said Cameron Ajdari, a founder of Currents Management in Los Angeles, which represents many dadfluencers. "It's created a big appetite for dad content, not just from brands, but also from parents and dads all around the world. Dad influencers are making other dads feel seen in a way that wasn't happening before."
The rise of dadfluencers has also been fueled by the booming popularity of TikTok. "With Instagram, a lot of men were uncomfortable with putting up these edited, staged pictures and captions," said James Nord, a founder of Fohr, an influencer marketing firm in New York City. "But TikTok has been a great entry point for a lot of dad influencers, because it comes across like you're documenting your life in a natural way, and you don't have to put yourself out there as much."
Advertisers are taking note. "Dad influencers are a kind of Trojan horse for brands," Mr. Nord said. "They are speaking to an audience that might not traditionally think of themselves as looking to other men on the internet for, say, fashion advice. But other dads are an easy entry point. And all of a sudden, here's someone people trust and relate to, talking about new pants that they love. People might not even realize that they're being influenced by this. They weren't coming to that person for style advice, but that's what they're getting."
Another reason that dads are curious to see how other dads parent is that they're in largely uncharted territory, compared with previous generations. In 2016, dads in the United States reported spending an average of eight hours a week on child care -- about triple the time that dads contributed in 1965, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.
Dads also said they spent about 10 hours a week on household chores in 2016, an increase from four hours in 1965. (Alas, while dads are doing more, a major gender gap persists: Mothers spent about 14 hours a week on child care and 18 hours a week on housework in 2016.)
The pandemic was brutal for parents in general (particularly moms, data shows), but dads were less likely to have the support systems that women are socialized to cultivate in times of hardship (also known as the "tend and befriend" response to stress).
"Traditionally, dads haven't really talked about parenting. My friends and I certainly didn't," said Thomas Piccirilli, a web developer and father of two in Monmouthshire, Wales, who posts under the Instagram account @the.dad.vibes, which has about 250,000 followers. "I think a big reason that what I was doing resonated was that I was honest and genuine about what I was experiencing."
When Kevin Laferriere and Evan Kyle Berger, comedians turned stay-at-home dads in Los Angeles, started posting skits about parenting to their shared account on TikTok, @thedumbdads, in 2021, they were also surprised by how much dads responded. "Our goal was mostly to have fun and to use it as a creative outlet," Mr. Laferriere said. "Then we heard from dads who said heartfelt things like, 'I'm the only stay-at-home dad I know, and your content helped me feel seen."'
Unlike some dadfluencers who lean into tired tropes of fatherhood -- dads are hapless morons who can't do anything, while moms are exasperated, overbearing multitaskers -- Mr. Laferriere and Mr. Berger are intentional about focusing on the universal fact that parenting is hard, regardless of who is doing it. "You're going to make mistakes. That's where the 'dumb dad' aspect comes in," Mr. Berger said. "But we're not about the weaponized incompetence that you see in a lot of dad content."
They both recalled a cleaning product commercial from their childhoods that depicted a mom coming home from work, clearly tired, to find her husband scaling a fish in the kitchen, proudly claiming that he had "dinner handled" as fish guts flew everywhere.
"Like, really? What picture are we painting of what a father is supposed to be? We don't do those types of jokes," Mr. Laferriere said. "We get enough material from being involved parents who make mistakes like everyone else. It's healthy for us to talk openly about this stuff. Screwing up, looking stupid. It's relatable."
Also relatable, albeit more fraught, is dads complaining.
"There's a lot of dads out there who are probably like, 'I'm supposed to be able to handle this without complaining or without needing support,"' said Mike Julianelle, a content marketing manager and father of two in Brooklyn who posts about parenting under the accounts @dadandburied and @gottoddlered. "But I'm very much pro-complaining, and I do it constantly, publicly, all the time."
He gets pushback for this. "I hear things like, 'If you're going to complain about your kids, you shouldn't have them.' But I think that's total nonsense. Everyone deserves to get things off their chest," he said. And finding solidarity is a nice perk. "I hear from dads, and moms too, telling me that I make them feel better."
Mr. Julianelle isn't the only one who has been surprised by the community that has grown out of his social media presence. Aaron Martin, a journalist turned stay-at-home dad in Miami, said that he never expected to make friends when he started posting Instagram videos of himself with his daughter under the account @stayathomedad. "But the more I started poking around when my daughter was napping or at night, I noticed a lot of other dads who were in similar positions, and ended up exchanging messages with some of them," he said.
Since then, he has connected with more of his dad followers, and they've even gotten together in person with their kids. "At first, I didn't know any other stay-at-home dads. And growing up in the late '80s and early '90s, I didn't really have any models for it, either. So it was isolating," he said. "The moms had their group texts, and I felt a little excluded at times." Now that he has built a network, he feels more confident as a parent, and he hopes to be an example for other dads too.
The world of dadfluencers is still relatively small, compared with many other influencer categories. But it includes a range of demographics. There are Christian dads (like Adam Busby, @adambuzz, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram), the "girl dad" (Joel Conder, a.k.a. @DadVGirls, with 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube), the "boy dad" (Devale Ellis, @iamdevale, with 2.1 million followers on Instagram), the gay dads (Jeffrey Romney Wright and Bryce Abplanalp of @growingupwithdads, with 21,000 followers on Instagram) and the cheerleader dad (Roland Pollard, of @rolandpollard, with seven million followers on TikTok). There are single dads, nonbinary dads, dads of children with special needs, dads with blended families and dads of quintuplets.
Of course, sharing your family life online comes with risks. Jonathan Joly, an influencer who started out on YouTube more than 14 years ago and now has 3.4 million followers on TikTok, weathered a backlash when he shared that one of his children is trans.
"When we learned our daughter was trans, we talked a lot about whether we could hide this from the world," he said. "But it would be really hard, and what does that tell our child?" Ultimately, he and his wife, Anna Saccone, decided to post about their daughter's transition.
"The things people call me, the things people say about me just because I've been supportive -- it's brutal," Mr. Joly said. But on the upside, he added, "so many parents say to me that I've opened their eyes to things that they wouldn't have known or accepted before."
In some ways, dadfluencers are reminiscent of the early mom bloggers of the aughts; they're speaking honestly about the trials of parenting in a public forum, and being met with a mix of judgment, eye rolling, empathy, curiosity and a kind of relief.
"I don't want to be like, 'Hi, I'm a dad and I'm so amazing. I get up at 5 o'clock in the morning and have a green juice,"' Mr. Joly said. "I stay up late every night, because it's the only time that I get to be on my own, and I need time on my own. I like content where it's about what other people do, but it shows the vulnerabilities of their parenting. And that's what I'm trying to do, too."

Where the Fine Dining Is Like Show Business: [Style Desk]

Full text: At his restaurants Sant Ambroeus and Casa Lever, Gherardo Guarducci seduces and pampers patrons. He knows they are not for everyone.
The panini arranged in soft mounds in the vitrine of Sant Ambroeus on Madison Avenue fairly ooze. There is the tuna, decadently layered with marinated artichoke; the pillowy frittata; the turkey stacked high with mozzarella and tomato and shellaced with Dijon mustard, all as savory looking as they are seductive.
As they should be, said Gherardo Guarducci, a partner in the SA Hospitality Group who, with Dimitri Pauli, owns the Sant Ambroeus restaurants seeded throughout Manhattan and in prosperous enclaves throughout the country.
"Food has given me some of the greatest moments of pleasure and prayer in my life," said Mr. Guarducci, who is the more public face of the company. "It can provide a feeling of nurturing, silence, spirituality and a satisfaction that is much like sex. I can never have enough."
You could say he overcompensates. He and Mr. Pauli have embarked on an expansion of late, their empire now stretching to encompass new Sant Ambroeus outposts in East Hampton, N.Y., which opened in November, and Aspen, Colo., which will open this week. Among other recent projects is a two-story Sant Ambroeus in Brookfield Place that opened in November 2020. It is a quick stroll from the World Trade Center, home to Condé Nast.
The partners are considering a location on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. There is also the more casual Felice, with 11 locations in New York and Florida.
But the jewel in the partners' crown is the newly restored Casa Lever, the former Lever House restaurant, owned and managed since 2009 by the SA Group, and situated on the ground floor of the totemic Lever House on Park Avenue. Their most lavishly upscale venture to date, the restaurant, which reopened last week after a monthslong hiatus, has been spruced up with a $ 3 million investment, the financing shared among SA Hospitality Group, Brookfield Properties and the WatermanClark investment group.
Like Sant Ambroeus, it has long been a magnet to personalties at the top of their professions, not least those in the notoriously capricious world of style. Now, as at its debut, one enters by way of a tunneled ramp that opens on a long dining room warmed with wood-slatted walls, black leather banquettes and discreet accents of pumpkin. Alcoves along one wall promise a touch of seclusion.
The setting is paradoxically cozy and theatrical, faithful to the original Marc Newson design but minus the feverishly colorful Andy Warhol portraits that once animated the room. (Silk-screened works, they belong to the real estate magnate Aby Rosen, who sold Lever House in 2020.) In their place will be a selection of Damien Hirst butterfly canvases and other blue-chip works. Imposing Ellsworth Kelly sculptures shield the garden from interlopers' eyes.
Setting is critical, for Mr. Guarducci subscribes to the popular wisdom that fine dining is like show business, an attraction for gawkers of varying stripe. At Casa Lever, as at Sant Ambroeus, "people-watching is very important," he said. "You come to be in the company of the titans of finance, real estate or the art world, because these people are powerful or famous -- or because they are your kind." Either way, the experience confers "a sense of belonging," he said.
As scenes go, Sant Ambroeus initially provided the template. "It's very clubby in a slightly snobby European way," said Ed Burstell, a retail and beauty branding consultant. The crowd, dense at breakfast time, picks up steam later in the day, Mr. Burstell noted. "There will always be a 'somebody,"' he said. "It's a guaranteed sighting."
Diners at the restaurants, who at various times have included Tom Ford, Carine Roitfeld, Thom Browne and Grace Coddington, provide a veneer of glamour and dynamism. "Fashion people set a lot of ideas -- I don't want to say trends -- for the community," Mr. Guarducci said. "You experience the restaurant differently when the fashion world endorses it. You approach it with a more open mind."
Fashion, however, can also lend an unwelcome air of elitism, as was observed in a 2010 New York Times two-star review of Casa Lever. A restaurant of the Manhattan old school, Casa Lever, the critic noted, "is built for socialites and those who finance them, staffed by handsome, rakish men with huge wristwatches."
Mr. Guarducci brushed off that long-ago slight like a dusting of lint. "It was what you would expect," he said. "It highlighted the fact that we are not for everyone."
Spoken like a haughty impresario. With his patrician features, springy salt-and-pepper hair and lean 6-foot-4-inch frame, Mr. Guarducci, 56, looks the part. But he seems at pains to counter that image.
"I did spend some time thinking about how formal I should be for this interview," he said. "These are the clothes that I normally wear," he said of his deep blue Zegna blazer, Aspesi corded trousers and brown suede Tom Ford shoes.
That muted look, he suggested, is well in line with his Tuscan-bred reserve. "I'm not a particularly social being," he said. And while his career has afforded him entree into society's upper echelons -- "I've met and had moments with everybody, from Bloomberg to the president," he said -- he describes himself, work aside, as something of a recluse.
To ease the built-in pressures of the work, he spends swaths of time at home with his wife, Samantha Tannehill, a model turned interior designer. There are visits as well from his four children from an earlier marriage, who range in age from 22 to 30. He seeks balance most mornings through a form of Vedic meditation. "And then I pray," he said.
The son of a textile entrepreneur, Mr. Guarducci expected to enter the family trade in the manufacturing town of Prato, but when that business faltered during the early 1990s, he decamped for New York. He has rarely looked back.
For a time he sold focaccia sandwiches in Bryant Park, where the fashion week shows were held. "I came to depend on Fern Mallis," he said of the executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America at that time. "She would decide when they set up the fashion week tents, whether my kiosk would become part of the show. I stayed and served focaccia to the fashion crowd."
In the early 2000s, he approached the Pauli family, then the owners of Sant Ambroeus, with the idea of reopening Sant Ambroeus on Madison (the canvas-tented original had closed in 2001). He and Mr. Pauli went on to found a series of sister restaurants in the city.
The venture thrived despite setbacks. "Covid arrived at the height of our success," Mr. Guarducci said. "The time was physically, mentally and emotionally so trying that it actually aged me."
He persists, though challenges remain. "We are the only business that needs to be excellent at managing all your senses -- what you see, smell, hear and taste," Mr. Guarducci said. "If the bread is stale or the room is loud, if any one of those things is off, you're going to feel that the food isn't that great."
Dining, he knows, tends to be an immersive experience. "As in any form of theater," he said, "you are only as good as your last performance."

Price Increases Pad Procter & Gamble's Profits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company raised prices 10 percent across its consumer brands for a second straight quarter and said its profit margin had widened.
Another round of price increases on household products like Gillette razors, Dawn dish soap and Swiffer dusters bolstered Procter & Gamble's bottom line last quarter, the company said on Friday, a sign that stubborn inflation may linger as companies defend their profit margins.
Procter & Gamble, a consumer goods bellwether, said its profit grew in the first three months of the year after it raised prices 10 percent across its brands. That rise was the company's second consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. Its profit margin expanded in the quarter, with price increases more than offsetting the rise in what it paid for raw materials.
Revenue rose 4 percent last quarter from a year earlier, even as sales volumes -- the number of rolls of Charmin toilet paper and boxes of Tide detergent -- fell 3 percent as consumers traded down to less expensive alternatives or bought less. In other words, Procter & Gamble made more money even though it sold fewer products. Sales volumes at the company have declined in the past four quarters.
"Consumer package goods companies are a relatively small part of what contributes to the overall level of inflation," said Sucharita Kodali, a retail trends analyst at Forrester, a research and advisory company. But, she added, they "contribute very much to the perception of inflation." Customers do not buy cars or houses every day, but many do notice price increases on frequent trips to the grocery store.
Jon Moeller, Procter & Gamble's chief executive, said in a statement that the company had delivered strong results "in what continues to be a very difficult cost and operating environment."
The company also raised its revenue forecast for this fiscal year to a 1 percent rise over the prior year; its previous forecast was a range of flat to a 1 percent drop. And it said it planned to buy back up to $ 8 billion of its own stock in its current fiscal year, which ends in June.
Procter & Gamble shares closed more than 3 percent higher on Friday.
Americans continued to spend in recent months even as companies passed along higher prices, but there are signs that consumers are starting to pull back: U.S. retail sales declined 1 percent in March from the previous month.
Inflation overall has moderated, climbing 5 percent over the year through March, down from a peak of near 9 percent in the summer. The deceleration has been prolonged and uneven, partly because companies find they can maintain higher prices, especially by pitching their offerings as premium products.
Procter & Gamble even had its own term for its products' high value -- "irresistible superiority" -- which was used several times on a conference call with analysts.
Consumers are getting more careful with spending, Andre Schulten, the company's chief financial officer, said on the call. "That just means we need to double down on our view of what superiority in some of our lower-value tiers means," he added. That may include communicating the value and quality of products to consumers.
Other consumer products makers have had similar results after increasing prices. In February, PepsiCo said it would not raise its prices further after multiple rounds of increases helped it achieve better-than-expected results in its fourth quarter. And Unilever said this year that it would continue to raise prices but ease the increases in the second half of the year.
Higher prices can frustrate consumers, said Ms. Kodali, the Forrester analyst. Brand loyalists, or "inelastic customers," are likely to keep buying products at higher prices, but other customers have already changed their shopping habits -- as evidenced by Procter & Gamble's decrease in sales volume.
A customer turned off by rising prices for Pampers disposable diapers, for example, might start using cloth alternatives instead. That customer will be hard for Procter & Gamble to win back.
Higher prices may be good for corporate profits, but they have complicated the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation by cooling the economy via a series of interest rate increases that started last year. Late last month, the Fed raised its benchmark rate to a range of 4.75 to 5 percent, up from near zero just over a year ago.
In Europe, policymakers have warned that companies' lifting prices above what is necessary to absorb higher costs could be fueling inflation. Policymakers have long been concerned with the wage-price spiral, in which higher wages push companies to raise prices to compensate for salary increases.
Now, the so-called profit-price spiral may be a risk, too. An executive board member at the European Central Bank warned last month that half of domestic price pressures in the eurozone in the fourth quarter of last year had come from company profits.
Executives at Procter & Gamble acknowledged on the call with analysts that there were still challenges ahead, like higher operating costs and wage increases.
There are "many headwinds that we're working against and will continue to work against as we move forward," Mr. Moeller said.

Where Was That Really Made? DNA Uncloaks Supply Chains.: [National Desk]

Full text: At a cotton gin in the San Joaquin Valley, in California, a boxy machine helps to spray a fine mist containing billions of molecules of DNA onto freshly cleaned Pima cotton.
That DNA will act as a kind of minuscule bar code, nestling amid the puffy fibers as they are shuttled to factories in India. There, the cotton will be spun into yarn and woven into bedsheets, before landing on the shelves of Costco stores in the United States. At any time, Costco can test for the DNA's presence to ensure that its American-grown cotton hasn't been replaced with cheaper materials -- like cotton from the Xinjiang region of China, which is banned in the United States because of its ties to forced labor.
Amid growing concern about opacity and abuses in global supply chains, companies and government officials are increasingly turning to technologies like DNA tracking, artificial intelligence and blockchains to try to trace raw materials from the source to the store.
Companies in the United States are now subject to new rules that require firms to prove their goods are made without forced labor, or face having them seized at the border. U.S. customs officials said in March that they had already detained nearly a billion dollars' worth of shipments coming into the United States that were suspected of having some ties to Xinjiang. Products from the region have been banned since last June.
Customers are also demanding proof that expensive, high-end products -- like conflict-free diamonds, organic cotton, sushi-grade tuna or Manuka honey -- are genuine, and produced in ethically and environmentally sustainable ways.
That has forced a new reality on companies that have long relied on a tangle of global factories to source their goods. More than ever before, companies must be able to explain where their products really come from.
The task may seem straightforward, but it can be surprisingly tricky. That's because the international supply chains that companies have built in recent decades to cut costs and diversify their product offerings have grown astonishingly complex. Since 2000, the value of intermediate goods used to make products that are traded internationally has tripled, driven partly by China's booming factories.
A large, multinational company may buy parts, materials or services from thousands of suppliers around the world. One of the largest such companies, Procter & Gamble, which owns brands like Tide, Crest and Pampers, has nearly 50,000 direct suppliers. Each of those suppliers may, in turn, rely on hundreds of other companies for the parts used to make its product -- and so on, for many levels up the supply chain.
To make a pair of jeans, for example, various companies must farm and clean cotton, spin it into thread, dye it, weave it into fabric, cut the fabric into patterns and stitch the jeans together. Other webs of companies mine, smelt or process the brass, nickel or aluminum that is crafted into the zipper, or make the chemicals that are used to manufacture synthetic indigo dye.
"Supply chains are like a bowl of spaghetti," said James McGregor, the chairman of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide, an advisory firm. "They get mixed all over. You don't know where that stuff comes from."
Given these challenges, some companies are turning to alternative methods, not all proven, to try to inspect their supply chains.
Some companies -- like the one that sprays the DNA mist onto cotton, Applied DNA Sciences -- are using scientific processes to tag or test a physical attribute of the good itself, to figure out where it has traveled on its path from factories to consumer.
Applied DNA has used its synthetic DNA tags, each just a billionth of the size of a grain of sugar, to track microcircuits produced for the Department of Defense, trace cannabis supply chains to ensure the product's purity and even to mist robbers in Sweden who attempted to steal cash from A.T.M.s, leading to multiple arrests.
MeiLin Wan, the vice president for textiles at Applied DNA, said the new regulations were creating a "tipping point for real transparency."
"There definitely is a lot more interest," she added.
The cotton industry was one of the earliest adopters of tracing technologies, in part because of previous transgressions. In the mid-2010s, Target, Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond faced expensive product recalls or lawsuits after the "Egyptian cotton" sheets they sold turned out to have been made with cotton from elsewhere. A New York Times investigation last year documented that the "organic cotton" industry was also rife with fraud.
In addition to the DNA mist it applies as a marker, Applied DNA can figure out where cotton comes from by sequencing the DNA of the cotton itself, or analyzing its isotopes, which are variations in the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the cotton. Differences in rainfall, latitude, temperature and soil conditions mean these atoms vary slightly across regions of the world, allowing researchers to map where the cotton in a pair of socks or bath towel has come from.
Other companies are turning to digital technology to map supply chains, by creating and analyzing complex databases of corporate ownership and trade.
Some firms, for example, are using blockchain technology to create a digital token for every product that a factory produces. As that product -- a can of caviar, say, or a batch of coffee -- moves through the supply chain, its digital twin gets encoded with information about how it has been transported and processed, providing a transparent log for companies and consumers.
Other companies are using databases or artificial intelligence to comb through vast supplier networks for distant links to banned entities, or to detect unusual trade patterns that indicate fraud -- investigations that could take years to carry out without computing power.
Sayari, a corporate risk intelligence provider that has developed a platform combining data from billions of public records issued globally, is one of those companies. The service is now used by U.S. customs agents as well as private companies. On a recent Tuesday, Jessica Abell, the vice president of solutions at Sayari, ran the supplier list of a major U.S. retailer through the platform and watched as dozens of tiny red flags appeared next to the names of distant companies.
"We're flagging not only the Chinese companies that are in Xinjiang, but then we're also automatically exploring their commercial networks and flagging the companies that are directly connected to it," Ms. Abell said. It is up to the companies to decide what, if anything, to do about their exposure.
Studies have found that most companies have surprisingly little visibility into the upper reaches of their supply chains, because they lack either the resources or the incentives to investigate. In a 2022 survey by McKinsey & Company, 45 percent of respondents said they had no visibility at all into their supply chain beyond their immediate suppliers.
But staying in the dark is no longer feasible for companies, particularly those in the United States, after the congressionally imposed ban on importing products from Xinjiang -- where 100,000 ethnic minorities are presumed by the U.S. government to be working in conditions of forced labor -- went into effect last year.
Xinjiang's links to certain products are already well known. Experts have estimated that roughly one in five cotton garments sold globally contains cotton or yarn from Xinjiang. The region is also responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's polysilicon, which is used in solar panels, and a quarter of its tomato paste.
But other industries, like cars, vinyl flooring and aluminum, also appear to have connections to suppliers in the region and are coming under more scrutiny from regulators.
Having a full picture of their supply chains can offer companies other benefits, like helping them recall faulty products or reduce costs. The information is increasingly needed to estimate how much carbon dioxide is actually emitted in the production of a good, or to satisfy other government rules that require products to be sourced from particular places -- such as the Biden administration's new rules on electric vehicle tax credits.
Executives at these technology companies say they envision a future, perhaps within the next decade, in which most supply chains are fully traceable, an outgrowth of both tougher government regulations and the wider adoption of technologies.
"It's eminently doable," said Leonardo Bonanni, the chief executive of Sourcemap, which has helped companies like the chocolate maker Mars map out their supply chains. "If you want access to the U.S. market for your goods, it's a small price to pay, frankly."
Others express skepticism about the limitations of these technologies, including their cost. While Applied DNA's technology, for example, adds only 5 to 7 cents to the price of a finished piece of apparel, that may be significant for retailers competing on thin margins.
And some express concerns about accuracy, including, for example, databases that may flag companies incorrectly. Investigators still need to be on the ground locally, they say, speaking with workers and remaining alert for signs of forced or child labor that may not show up in digital records.
Justin Dillon, the chief executive of FRDM, a software company that helps organizations map their supply chains, said there was "a lot of angst, a lot of confusion" among companies trying to satisfy the government's new requirements.
Importers are "looking for boxes to check," he said. "And transparency in supply chains is as much an art as it is a science. It's kind of never done."

“It’s eminently doable,” said Leonardo Bonanni, the chief executive of Sourcemap, which has helped companies like the chocolate maker Mars map out their supply chains. “If you want access to the U.S. market for your goods, it’s a small price to pay, frankly.”
Others express skepticism about the limitations of these technologies, including their cost. While Applied DNA’s technology, for example, adds only 5 to 7 cents to the price of a finished piece of apparel, that may be significant for retailers competing on thin margins.
And some express concerns about accuracy, including, for example, databases that may flag companies incorrectly. Investigators still need to be on the ground locally, they say, speaking with workers and remaining alert for signs of forced or child labor that may not show up in digital records.
Justin Dillon, chief executive of FRDM, a software company that helps organizations map their supply chains, said there was “a lot of angst, a lot of confusion” among companies trying to satisfy the government’s new requirements.
Importers are “looking for boxes to check,” he said. “And transparency in supply chains is as much an art as it is a science. It’s kind of never done.”
